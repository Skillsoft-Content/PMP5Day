Orlando Sequera: Of course, there's

137
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.880
Orlando Sequera: There's also

138
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.859
Orlando Sequera: the I the intention to share and promote best practices for project management. But

139
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:10.239
Orlando Sequera: keep in mind that not every single question is going to be answered. Great questions, what are great questions

140
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:17.450
Orlando Sequera: They are going to be related to the course content that we are covering. Remember that we're going to have those designated

141
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.409
Orlando Sequera: moments in the class to address those questions. Please

142
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:28.970
Orlando Sequera: keep them coming, but they're going to be addressed at a designated time through the class to avoid disruptions. All right.

143
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:37.680
Orlando Sequera: please include topics that everyone will benefit from from learning it's about learning. It's a learning journey right, getting ready for your Pmp. Exam.

144
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.569
Orlando Sequera: And try to avoid duplication as much as possible.

145
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.160
Orlando Sequera: All right.

146
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.389
Orlando Sequera: We have our moderators. There's a lot. There are a lot of questions in there

147
00:12:51.710 --> 00:13:03.950
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. A. Already put again. One more time. You do not have to check your name if you already did it yesterday, and you're logging in today with the same information

148
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:13.699
Orlando Sequera: is live attendance required. Yes, this is a requirement by the Project Management Institute.

149
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.879

150
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.540
Orlando Sequera: it is a requirement

151
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.520
Orlando Sequera: for live attendance. But we have

152
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.990
Orlando Sequera: some exceptions.

153
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:32.229
Orlando Sequera: You're allowed to me. If you make up the session by watching the replay. If you miss more than 50 min at a time.

154
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.880
Orlando Sequera: You will need to make up

155
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.150
Orlando Sequera: by attending the life session in a different fight. They cohort.

156
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.510
Orlando Sequera: Please check

157
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:46.090
Orlando Sequera: calendar.com for information about upcoming sessions

158
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.130
Orlando Sequera: right

159
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.349
Orlando Sequera: in case of absence.

160
00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:02.359
Orlando Sequera: You can request a replay for a previous session by asking in the Q. And a.

161
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:18.219
Orlando Sequera: Or a past or current session by emailing the mentoring team@thisemailaddressmentoringatskillsoft.com. Please provide them with the information. So this is how you request a replay of a previous session.

162
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:30.640
Orlando Sequera: Then then email to mentoring@kilsoft.com. Please provide the following information: we have multiple cohorts: we want to make sure that we give you the right session, the one that you attended

163
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.939
Orlando Sequera: provide information on the Boot Camp cohort that you're attending this session number

164
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.450

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.000
Orlando Sequera: and

166
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.800
Orlando Sequera: that in, if if at all possible, in your time zone, and that's going to help your

167
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:53.419
Orlando Sequera: mentors to provide you with the right. Replay this. There's an example here for the 5 Day boot camp.

168
00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:08.490
Orlando Sequera: This will be an example pretty much for for all of you, if you are to request the replay for yesterday. This is the information that we will need to get@mentoringatskillsoft.com. 1 point that I want to make

169
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.849
Orlando Sequera: is that if you want to

170
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:31.900
Orlando Sequera: watch the replace for study purposes, you attended all 5 sessions, and you want to have access to the replace just for review purposes. There's no limit in requesting the replace for study purposes. Okay. But how do you do that? You can ask in the Q. A. Or you can send an email

171
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.649
Orlando Sequera: at this email address mentoring@skillssoft.com.

172
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:37.569
Orlando Sequera: All right.

173
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:41.800
Orlando Sequera: All right.

174
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:52.149
Orlando Sequera: Let's go over a recap Yesterday we cover, hey? Great content. We get started

175
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.230
Orlando Sequera: and let's go over the recap for

176
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.860
Orlando Sequera: the number one.

177
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:02.699
Orlando Sequera: And we talked about mainly about the business environment.

178
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.720
Orlando Sequera: That's what we talked about. That was a lesson one.

179
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.969
Orlando Sequera: We cover some basic

180
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.820
Orlando Sequera: definitions. We went over

181
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.769
Orlando Sequera: the foundation of project management.

182
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.260
Orlando Sequera: We also went over

183
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.120
Orlando Sequera: basic concepts. We know what a project is.

184
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.110
Orlando Sequera: It's a temporary endeavor that has.

185
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.290
Orlando Sequera: and by temporary I mean that he has a definite beginning and a definite end.

186
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.770
Orlando Sequera: It is not open, ended. That's operations right

187
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.190
Orlando Sequera: to with the purpose of producing a product, service or result.

188
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.009
Orlando Sequera: So that is the main basic definition of a project. But the main point is that he has

189
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:54.510
Orlando Sequera: definite beginning. It starts at some point in time, and he has a definite end. Operations are ongoing. That is the main difference between

190
00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:05.620
Orlando Sequera: operations and projects. Okay, projects. They start at a certain point in time, and they end at a certain point in time. Temporary does not mean that they're sure. That's another misconception.

191
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.630
Orlando Sequera: Some projects can take

192
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.740
Orlando Sequera: many years.

193
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:10.550
they

194
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:17.020
Orlando Sequera: 25 years in some cases, and for those of you, as I was mentioned yesterday, that have experience with

195
00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:17.970
Orlando Sequera: a

196
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.029
Orlando Sequera: the Government that's that's very common.

197
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:27.860
Orlando Sequera: but they will come to an end at some point in time. Okay, the operations are

198
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.040
Orlando Sequera: ongoing.

199
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.380
Orlando Sequera: So that's the main difference between the 2. And then we went over

200
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.460
Orlando Sequera: bye

201
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:40.009
Orlando Sequera: portfolios, programs and projects. So remember, projects are individual initiatives.

202
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.180
Orlando Sequera: If you combine

203
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.509
Orlando Sequera: a group of individual initiatives that we call projects

204
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.380
Orlando Sequera: together because they cover certain areas that are similar.

205
00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.489
Orlando Sequera: That collection we call it program.

206
00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:04.100
Orlando Sequera: and then we can even go at a at an even higher level. We can have collections of programs and individual initiatives, projects, and we call that a portfolio.

207
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:09.589
Orlando Sequera: and that helps organization, especially upper management. They

208
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:15.930
Orlando Sequera: they look at things different at a higher level, and that strategic grouping really helps

209
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:22.029
Orlando Sequera: a organizations to be aligned to make sure that they're

210
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:36.560
Orlando Sequera: making the right decisions for not only an individual project, but for all the produce in different areas. So they're trying to cover within the organization. That's what we mean by strategic alignment and project management provides a systematic framework

211
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:43.579
Orlando Sequera: that allows organizations to make the best decisions possible. And that's why we group it

212
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.680
Orlando Sequera: in

213
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.270
Orlando Sequera: in projects, individual initiatives.

214
00:18:48.860 --> 00:19:00.040
Orlando Sequera: programs, collections of projects, and then portfolios, which is a collection of programs and individual initiatives or projects. So the decision making process

215
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:06.450
Orlando Sequera: it really works well. The goal that you may be wondering. But how does that help organizations? Well.

216
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:25.969
Orlando Sequera: it helps them. It's about decision making it's about decision making, and remember that organizations have limited resource, no organization, not even the Amazons of the world or the Microsoft of the world. They have limited resources. They don't have an an infinite amount of money, and an infinite amount of time.

217
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.820
Orlando Sequera: 2

218
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:36.670
Orlando Sequera: to to conduct their projects. They they have all them have limitations, so they want to be as efficient as especially in this day and age.

219
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:48.389
Orlando Sequera: As you know, the the the economies and turmoil right now. So in this day and age this is critical for organizations to have a systematic approach to make the best use of

220
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:56.360
Orlando Sequera: their limited resources. And that's where project management comes into play, because project management is.

221
00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:13.230
Orlando Sequera: It's a repeatable process. It's systematic. It allows them to make the best decisions. The best use of the resources to really make those strategic goals that they have as an organization to come to fruition, and we do that through

222
00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.909
Orlando Sequera: the lit project selection process.

223
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:20.239
Orlando Sequera: We organizations. We know now that they take into account

224
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:38.549
Orlando Sequera: multiple ways to select their projects like present value, net press and value pay back, and they're going to invest their resources in those projects that provide them with the higher benefits. Okay, that is.

225
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.460
that is really important to keep in mind.

226
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:47.750
Orlando Sequera: That's really important to keep in mind. So this net present value present value.

227
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:53.030
Orlando Sequera: By the way, i'm gonna i'm gonna share with you an anecdote on that on.

228
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.689
Orlando Sequera: I to calculate

229
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.650
Orlando Sequera: the

230
00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.990
Orlando Sequera: the midperson value as a homework when I

231
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.680
Orlando Sequera: took my my

232
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.620
Orlando Sequera: I got my master's degree

233
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.190
Orlando Sequera: 12 years ago in project management

234
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.179
Orlando Sequera: in I remember one of the classes that I took.

235
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.689
Orlando Sequera: The there was an exercise, and it was to calculate the net person value of

236
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.910
Orlando Sequera: my master's program.

237
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.130
Orlando Sequera: Basically.

238
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:30.650
Orlando Sequera: So they gave us some information and inflation rate. I think it was 8 or 10%, and we calculated for the next 5 years. In the next 5 years

239
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:41.960
Orlando Sequera: it was that the best decision, right that that we were trying to. The goal was to get information from calculating that my present value and

240
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.680
Orlando Sequera: basically the No. I came up with a number that was very low.

241
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.650
Orlando Sequera: and little did I know when I went to class, and my

242
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.840
Orlando Sequera: our Professor, I was

243
00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:03.940
Orlando Sequera: ask me, out of 25 people to actually share the the results of my calculation with the rest of the class, and

244
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:10.529
Orlando Sequera: I came up with a result I mean I probably did something wrong, but i'm coming up with a very low number. So basically based on this

245
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.980
Orlando Sequera: based on that present value, this is telling me that my

246
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.899
Orlando Sequera: masters program.

247
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:27.049
Orlando Sequera: I I Shouldn't: I shouldn't be my master's program, is it? It's not a good decision. So the Professor said. Exactly. Is that a true statement?

248
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.300
Orlando Sequera: And I said, Nope, I think there's a lot of intangibles is

249
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.080
Orlando Sequera: because the the financial aspect of it I think it is.

250
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:47.279
Orlando Sequera: There are a lot of intangible benefits that come with the master with the masters program, and he said, Exactly, that's where we were trying to to go with this exercise.

251
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:53.340
Orlando Sequera: So organs so organizations the ones that are smarter. They use those financial metrics.

252
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.740
Orlando Sequera: but they also look at in tangible. They it's the same principle.

253
00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.809
Orlando Sequera: They it's not the point that i'm trying to make. Is

254
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.290
Orlando Sequera: It's not just.

255
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.660
Orlando Sequera: Am I going to make money?

256
00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:09.230
Orlando Sequera: Okay, with this project? It's not just about profit, right? There are other

257
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.009
Orlando Sequera: factors that you need to take into account like intangibles.

258
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:19.900
Orlando Sequera: It could be corporate social responsibility. It could be helping the community. So look at the benefits, not just from

259
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.920
Orlando Sequera: the

260
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:41.480
Orlando Sequera: the tangible aspect. Do you also have to look at it from the tangible perspective? So that was the whole goal with that exercise. Okay. And at the end of the day. What organizations are trying to do is to add value is to add value with to the organization with those projects. And remember what we said. Value

261
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:51.989
Orlando Sequera: is defined by the stakeholders. Value is defined by your by the business, by your customers.

262
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.560
Orlando Sequera: by your customers. You do not define value for them.

263
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.890
Orlando Sequera: they

264
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.149
Orlando Sequera: will value definition is is gonna come from your customers. Okay?

265
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.999
Orlando Sequera: Then we also talked about

266
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.789
Orlando Sequera: 2 important concepts

267
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.060
Orlando Sequera: that we need to understand. For the Pmp. Exam: we talked about

268
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:21.239
Orlando Sequera: enterprise, environmental factors, and we also talked about organizational process assets.

269
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.469
Orlando Sequera: Those 2 are critical

270
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:32.459
Orlando Sequera: for the Pmp. Exam. For you to understand right? They're not going to ask you questions specifically on the definitions, but you need to understand what they are

271
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.250
Orlando Sequera: and the enterprise, environmental factors.

272
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.430
Orlando Sequera: amy factors.

273
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:43.659
Orlando Sequera: external or internal, that are outside of the control of the project team

274
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.340
Orlando Sequera: external.

275
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.570
Orlando Sequera: for example, marketplace conditions.

276
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:59.349
Orlando Sequera: Imagine if you're working in a software Development project and you are located somewhere just as an example in the mid west of

277
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:05.249
Orlando Sequera: somewhere in the midwest here in the Us. And you're trying to to get

278
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:24.839
Orlando Sequera: You need to you. You're trying to get software developers for your software program marketplace conditions. You may or may not have enough local a software developers to work on that project. If you're trying to look for for local software developers, right?

279
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.460
Orlando Sequera: So that is some you can control that. It's simply it's. It's just a fact

280
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.530
Orlando Sequera: or

281
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:37.320
Orlando Sequera: a economic situation or global supply chain issues right now, or

282
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:43.959
Orlando Sequera: all prices right? You can control that. But depending on your project, they are those factors.

283
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.760
Orlando Sequera: My P. Are going to have

284
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.179
Orlando Sequera: an impact on your project. And then internally.

285
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.810
Orlando Sequera: there are some other factors. The first one

286
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.110
Orlando Sequera: organizational culture

287
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.540
Orlando Sequera: that covers

288
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.239
Orlando Sequera: tons of topics that covers

289
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.619
Orlando Sequera: tons of topics. It. It is about the

290
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:10.340
Orlando Sequera: the values and the system of belief that the organization has in place

291
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:28.860
Orlando Sequera: the politics of the organization, all that is cover, and you need to. That is part of your job, especially if you're new to the organization to understand and cause. It also covers the power relationships, and those factors are gonna have an impact on your project. So organization of culture, you need to understand.

292
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.970
Orlando Sequera: And we also went over

293
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:38.729
Orlando Sequera: some important definitions that can help us With that we chase the type of organizational structure.

294
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.050
Orlando Sequera: For example.

295
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.839
Orlando Sequera: we need to understand whether

296
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.490
Orlando Sequera: the organizational structure is

297
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.059
Orlando Sequera: functional. If it's functional.

298
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:55.369
Orlando Sequera: we know that our level of authority as a project manager is low is very low to none.

299
00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:03.790
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and that means that the decisions are going to be made by functional managers, and we have to work with that. That is

300
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.540
Orlando Sequera: a functional organization. Then we have the opposite side of this. The spectrum

301
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.550
Orlando Sequera: which is projectized organizations in which

302
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:14.710
Orlando Sequera: they

303
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:22.629
Orlando Sequera: and the team members employees is is basically they report to a project manager, and the way it works is that

304
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:30.489
Orlando Sequera: those teams. They move from project to project to project. So the project manager has a high level of authority.

305
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:39.930
Orlando Sequera: and it's also the functional manager for those team members, and they move from project to project to project. But in between those 2

306
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.170
Orlando Sequera: extremes

307
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.570
Orlando Sequera: we have.

308
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.199
Orlando Sequera: we call a matrix, which is a combination of the 2

309
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.390
Orlando Sequera: center more

310
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.290
Orlando Sequera: of organizations. What? Why.

311
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:59.139
Orlando Sequera: all within the matrix category. But the matrix category has 3 flavors.

312
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.290
Orlando Sequera: Those 3 flavors are

313
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:10.759
Orlando Sequera: week. Matrix that's very close to the functional organization in which the level of authority of the product manager is very low.

314
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.430
Orlando Sequera: That's what we have to pay attention

315
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.689
Orlando Sequera: 2. Then we have a balanced matrix.

316
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:26.770
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So you have in a balanced matrix. You have a little bit more authority, and then you have a strum matrix that is closer to a projectized organization.

317
00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:33.389
Orlando Sequera: So it is crucial when we're reading the questions, the Pmp. Exam. Questions that we

318
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.290
Orlando Sequera: try to pinpoint. What type of organization

319
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.360
Orlando Sequera: am I working

320
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.370
Orlando Sequera: with.

321
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:51.440
Orlando Sequera: What type of organization is this is this: You see the functional organization? Is it a is it a mate, a wig matrix? Or is it a projectized organization because they

322
00:28:51.570 --> 00:29:01.659
Orlando Sequera: this issues that or or the actions that you're gonna be able to to make as a project manager are gonna change based on what? Based on the level of authority. Okay.

323
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:08.310
Orlando Sequera: pay attention to that. That is important. And then we wrapped up the session with 2 additional topics

324
00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.979
Orlando Sequera: Project governance.

325
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:22.970
Orlando Sequera: This is about oversight organizations. All organizations are going to have some sort of oversight. Some of them have more oversight than others, but there's always going to be some level of

326
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:29.780
Orlando Sequera: a oversight or or project government. Okay, or going to large your organizations. Of course there

327
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:41.359
Orlando Sequera: more sophisticated, they might have more controls in place. These has also this. This has a direct relation with the type of industry. I can tell you that a NASA, for example, has

328
00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.370
Orlando Sequera: governance oversight controls in place

329
00:29:45.560 --> 00:30:02.810
Orlando Sequera: that all of the contracting organizations that are doing work for them have to follow. And then for you as a Pm. You have to follow oversight internal oversight of your own organization. If you're a contracting organization. And here i'm talking about the

330
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:21.510
Orlando Sequera: companies like North Rock Ramen, for example, or Jacobs or the Ibm, or those of companies that provide services to to NASA, for example, they have their internal oversight. But do you also have to follow NASA's oversight. So it is.

331
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:40.989
Orlando Sequera: It is important to keep that in mind. But you might be wondering even what about a startup do they have oversight? They do, because this is about the there's gonna be some level of oversight. They're gonna be watching a. Wh: how well are you? Are you tracking and managing your budget for your project, and the time that it takes

332
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.670
Orlando Sequera: right. So there are. There is going to be some level of oversight, and that's what we mean by product governance. And we need to know that

333
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.330
Orlando Sequera: we have to

334
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.979
Orlando Sequera: understand what is the level of governance that is going to be.

335
00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.229
Orlando Sequera: that that is gonna be needed, or for our projects to follow, because we are gonna be governed

336
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.589
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the size of the industry. There is

337
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:12.239
Orlando Sequera: oversight, we and we have to be aware of that. As we mentioned yesterday, there is a great resource

338
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.919
Orlando Sequera: that allows organizations

339
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.930
Orlando Sequera: 2

340
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.759
Orlando Sequera: combined to help with best practices for project management. It allows them to also

341
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.680
Orlando Sequera: A.

342
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.080
Orlando Sequera: In some cases

343
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:32.230
Orlando Sequera: they be it the it helps with the oversight, which is the project Management office.

344
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:38.700
Orlando Sequera: If your organization has a Pmo. In place or project management office leverage

345
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:50.869
Orlando Sequera: their knowledge, leverage their tools, and make sure that you get guidance from them when it comes to project governance they are. That's one of their main functions. They will help you with that. Okay?

346
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:57.589
Orlando Sequera: And we wrapped up the session yesterday with information about

347
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.840
Orlando Sequera: one type of requirement that is critical.

348
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:10.919
Orlando Sequera: and that is gonna that has multiple implications that touches multiple areas of your project, which is compliance.

349
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.379
Orlando Sequera: This is a make or break, deal

350
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.860
Orlando Sequera: non-compliance can

351
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.960
Orlando Sequera: be.

352
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.790
Orlando Sequera: Can the rail? Your project can

353
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:28.690
Orlando Sequera: actually be a disaster for your project? Non-compliance and it touches primarily 2 areas of your project.

354
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:35.910
Orlando Sequera: The first one is risk. So we need to understand the impacts of non-compliance. What if

355
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:41.550
Orlando Sequera: right, what happens if we are non-compliant? We need to identify those risks

356
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:46.160
Orlando Sequera: associated with non-compliance, and then follow the process that we have.

357
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.180
Orlando Sequera: or

358
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.979
Orlando Sequera: for risk management.

359
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:55.940
Orlando Sequera: We we'll cover that in detail later in the class. If you see in less than number 3 we have a specific topic of a risk.

360
00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:02.239
Orlando Sequera: but in essence is about identifying those risks. Make sure that we document them

361
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:07.829
Orlando Sequera: in a document that we call Risk register, which is a running list of risks.

362
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.420
Orlando Sequera: We need to have someone assigned

363
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:14.270
Orlando Sequera: to that risk risk owner, and we also need to

364
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:21.119
Orlando Sequera: analyze the risk, understand the impact. We have 2 types of analysis that we're going to cover in detail when we get to risk.

365
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:37.119
Orlando Sequera: and we need to be able to identify our response, which is what we're gonna implement. If that risk comes to fruition at risk, by the way, is an uncertainty, something that may or may not happen. We'll talk about that in detail later.

366
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:44.240
Orlando Sequera: but non-compliance is huge. It's a type of requirement we need from the very beginning. We need to start working

367
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:59.910
Orlando Sequera: on identifying the compliance, and that changes from organization to organization that changes from industry to industry. So, and he goes back to that aspect of organizational culture right that that

368
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:14.019
Orlando Sequera: it it's also linked to to that topic. It is important that we are able to develop that situational awareness as quickly as possible. So for those of you that are starting your careers in product management.

369
00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:19.649
Orlando Sequera: That is, step number one. Try to understand the organizational culture

370
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.679
Orlando Sequera: of the new organization.

371
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:31.599
Orlando Sequera: Try to understand the power relationship because all that is going to have an an impact in multiple areas of your project, hey? Sometimes those relationships are clear.

372
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:43.810
Orlando Sequera: Sometimes they're not. It takes time. It's not something that is gonna happen overnight. This takes it takes time, but at least as a good practice as a good project manager that i'm sure that all of you want to be.

373
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:50.960
Orlando Sequera: This is something that you have to do, starting on day one. And this is not written in any onboarding

374
00:34:51.389 --> 00:35:05.419
Orlando Sequera: or training materials that you that you get at when in your onboarding process. If this is part of that tribal knowledge is something you have to figure out on your own, the quicker you do it, the better is going to be

375
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:19.749
Orlando Sequera: with your the better. It's gonna be for your projects. Okay, and it takes time. And you also have to knit work with people. Talk to people. Do You have to just do it on your own. Talk to people network with all the project managers it.

376
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:26.560
Orlando Sequera: You have to be proactive. It's not. It's not gonna come your way you have. This is part of your job

377
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.410
Orlando Sequera: to figure out the environment.

378
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.129
Orlando Sequera: Yes.

379
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:37.260
Orlando Sequera: those factors are gonna have an impact on your environment. And today we're gonna start. We're gonna continue

380
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.709
Orlando Sequera: our journey

381
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.999
Orlando Sequera: in the class. We're going to have great topics. We're going to start talking now that we have that

382
00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:45.569
Orlando Sequera: the

383
00:35:45.690 --> 00:36:00.900
Orlando Sequera: aspect of Project selection foundation, basic come since Co. Concepts cover project selection. We talked about governance and compliance. We're going to continue a journey with what happens when we start working on the product. On our project.

384
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:10.450
Orlando Sequera: things happen. This is where we start identifying those stakeholders, and we're going to go over that definition. We start

385
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.299
Orlando Sequera: and the stakeholders, and also engage in those stakeholders for a project.

386
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.270
Orlando Sequera: This is where we start forming the team for our projects.

387
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.310
Orlando Sequera: This is also when

388
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:37.989
Orlando Sequera: we need to be on the same page, build, share, understanding, not only for the team, but also for the stakeholders. We need to be on the same page. It's not just a team. We cannot be going in different directions. Okay.

389
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:49.850
Orlando Sequera: that's a recipe for trouble in the future we need to be aligned with what the stakeholders are expecting. We're building something for for them, not for us.

390
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.979
Orlando Sequera: for them.

391
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:56.200
Orlando Sequera: and it might sound trivial in my sound, even borderline cliche.

392
00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:03.090
Orlando Sequera: But it is a true statement. I have seen that more often than not in which the team they think they are going in the right direction.

393
00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:13.720
Orlando Sequera: but it's not necessarily aligned with the customer wants. So that is important about building that share. Understanding. This is where we also go, and a little more detail about the project approach?

394
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.970
Orlando Sequera: Are we going to go

395
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.089
Orlando Sequera: predictive or waterful, or to

396
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:26.540
Orlando Sequera: are we going to go adaptive or agile? Or are we going to go with a ha

397
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:31.989
Orlando Sequera: approach mixing. So remember something when we talked about agile yesterday as well.

398
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.720
Orlando Sequera: they are not mutually exclusive.

399
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.250
Orlando Sequera: The fact that you use, or.

400
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:53.939
Orlando Sequera: if you start using predictive. You can change that. You can change that if if it's not I it they're not mutual exclusive doesn't. You can change course. You can make some match. They it's not agile or traditional versus agile right? That's not the right

401
00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:05.420
Orlando Sequera: a the right conversation. It is agile and traditional. You can dig. You can mix and match it. What works for your specific situation? You have

402
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.539
Orlando Sequera: total freedom to

403
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:15.760
Orlando Sequera: take aspects from traditional, that were for your project, and also in corporate aspects of agile that work for your project. That's perfectly fine. That's

404
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:31.289
Orlando Sequera: hybrid, hey? So we can. So we have basically 3 approaches that we can follow, and we're going to wrap up the session in the afternoon, talking about the planning aspect of our projects. So that's what we have in store for today.

405
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:37.220
Orlando Sequera: and we are going to get started all right.

406
00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:39.029
Orlando Sequera: So before

407
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.209
Orlando Sequera: before I start, let's take

408
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.490
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna take a few minutes

409
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.490
Orlando Sequera: to address to see if we have

410
00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:54.490
Orlando Sequera: any content. Related questions in the Q. And a. Please vote. If you see any questions that are

411
00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.259
Orlando Sequera: that are actually

412
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.290
Orlando Sequera: important, let me review.

413
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:10.680
Orlando Sequera: Okay, i'm seeing mostly questions about technical issues. We have our moderators taking care of that.

414
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.899
Orlando Sequera: Okay, I see one here in your example. Yesterday

415
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.950
Orlando Sequera: you mentioned FDA Inspectors interrupting to conduct a surprise inspection

416
00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.669
Orlando Sequera: is this: Consider an opa on ef

417
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.189
Orlando Sequera: it is an E. I don't have any control over

418
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:42.240
Orlando Sequera: FDA inspectors coming in, so that that's any that will be an Ef: in that particular case.

419
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.270
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

420
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:51.660
Orlando Sequera: that's done. I'm gonna look for additional questions in the Q. A.

421
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.689
Orlando Sequera: Content related.

422
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.580
Okay.

423
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.850
Orlando Sequera: all right. I'm going to view the chat.

424
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.849
Orlando Sequera: I see mostly

425
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.770
Orlando Sequera: questions about technical issues in the Q. And a.

426
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:37.290
Orlando Sequera: There's some comments in the chat compliances of terms of conditions written by Well, of course. Yes, that in some cases you might have regulations that you have to be compliant with.

427
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.379
Orlando Sequera: Absolutely.

428
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.399
Orlando Sequera: That's a common in the chat. I think compliance. We have some terms and conditions written by government.

429
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.160
Orlando Sequera: Whenever we develop the application, we have to follow the terms and conditions

430
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.570
Orlando Sequera: exactly exactly. We have to be compliant. That's exactly

431
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:59.239
Orlando Sequera: what we need to know that we need to know that that's why we take into account Eef and opa.

432
00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.250
Orlando Sequera: All right. I'm. Trying to look for additional questions in the

433
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.359
Orlando Sequera: There's another question. Our predictive and traditional Consider synonymous. Yes.

434
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.690
Orlando Sequera: for the purposes of this training. Yes.

435
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:24.940
Orlando Sequera: when you say traditional, we mean predictive, and you can also call it waterfall is the same thing. Yes.

436
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:26.859
Orlando Sequera: right.

437
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.690
Orlando Sequera: all right. So I think we're cut up with the questions. Let's get started with the content

438
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.830
Orlando Sequera: in.

439
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.460
Orlando Sequera: Now, we're going to talk about

440
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:45.509
Orlando Sequera: starting the project. We're gonna start with identifying and engaging our stakeholders. We also gonna follow with

441
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.680
Orlando Sequera: forming the team.

442
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:54.620
Orlando Sequera: Then we're gonna cover, build, and share a share understanding, getting it, getting everyone on the same page.

443
00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:00.760
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to wrap up this lesson with determining the project. Approach

444
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:05.370
Orlando Sequera: these topics. Just so, you know. You might be wondering.

445
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.040
Orlando Sequera: Yesterday you mentioned the Exam Content outline

446
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.729
Orlando Sequera: multiple times.

447
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:26.129
Orlando Sequera: How is this related to the exam Content outline? Well, we have topics here that are related to the people domain, and we also have some topics that are related to the process domain. But

448
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:38.259
Orlando Sequera: and and when it comes to the time and triangle, we have topics that cover all 3 sites. So this is really, really, really important. Basically what we're covering is how we start projects. Okay.

449
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.520
Orlando Sequera: all right.

450
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.320
Orlando Sequera: The learning objectives that we have

451
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.829
Orlando Sequera: the main outcome is.

452
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.119
Orlando Sequera: Define your stakehold, your project stakeholders, and

453
00:42:52.980 --> 00:43:11.569
Orlando Sequera: discover the most effective ways to communicate with them. As we mentioned, we have to engage our stakeholders and the vehicle for that engagement is communication. That's how we keep our stakeholders engage. We keep them engaged through communication.

454
00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.410
Orlando Sequera: Then we're gonna go over the best ways to form a team.

455
00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:24.279
Orlando Sequera: Also, how can we get everyone on the same page when it comes to understanding the project, and how.

456
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:31.620
Orlando Sequera: by doing that, getting everyone on the same page, getting everyone aligned, and by everyone I mean the team and also

457
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.330
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholders.

458
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.829
Orlando Sequera: That's how that related to the

459
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:38.990
Orlando Sequera: to increase in the chances of

460
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:53.379
Orlando Sequera: a success for our project. Okay, that is really important. We need to be on some page we need to be. We need. We all need to be moving on the same direction. We start going in different directions, and for those of you that come from the military. You know this better than me.

461
00:43:53.430 --> 00:44:11.560
Orlando Sequera: Right. It's we need to be. We need to be on the same page. We need to be aligned if we need to be a well oil machine. You know this better than me those same principle here. Okay. But in this case it's not just the team. It's also your stakeholders.

462
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.950
Orlando Sequera: We're also gonna go over

463
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.089
Orlando Sequera: the predictive and adaptive life cycle.

464
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:32.519
Orlando Sequera: how they work, and then the combination of it to a little bit in a little bit more detail. We're going to go over a hybrid with which is nothing but a combination of a predictive approach, and also an adaptive approach. And then we're going to make that decision

465
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:39.619
Orlando Sequera: which approach is the best fit for our particular situation for our particular project.

466
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.179
Orlando Sequera: All right. So that's what we have in store for this session.

467
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.250
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

468
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.259
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna start with.

469
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:57.099
Orlando Sequera: identify and stay and engaging stakeholders. This is something that happens

470
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.130
Orlando Sequera: at the very beginning of a project needs to happen at the very beginning of a project.

471
00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.939
Orlando Sequera: By the way.

472
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.740
Orlando Sequera: you might be wondering what is the stakeholder?

473
00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:13.020
Orlando Sequera: A stakeholder is the actual textbook definition. Stakeholder is

474
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:19.760
Orlando Sequera: any individual or group of individuals that can impact your project.

475
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.009
Orlando Sequera: or that could be impacted by your project.

476
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.029
Orlando Sequera: For example.

477
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:33.330
Orlando Sequera: for example, and I see some comments in the chat. Anyone has an impact, or could be impacted by the project. So that's one side of.

478
00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:51.219
Orlando Sequera: I see a common in the chat. That's one side of it. One aspect of it, but it's also any any individual. A group of individuals that could also be impacted by the project that's a very broad definition. It's a very broad definition. Let's assume for a minute that we have.

479
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.170
Orlando Sequera: Our project is

480
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.560
Orlando Sequera: to build

481
00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:01.560
Orlando Sequera: a highway, a new highway i'm going to use. I usually use the Us. But i'm gonna

482
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.559
Orlando Sequera: switch continents. We're building

483
00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.849
Orlando Sequera: a new highway that is going from

484
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.540
Orlando Sequera: Western Europe

485
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.090
Orlando Sequera: all the way to Eastern Europe.

486
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:16.659
Orlando Sequera: Right? We're building a new highway, and based on that definition that I gave you.

487
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.679
Orlando Sequera: based on that definition that I gave you.

488
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.549
Orlando Sequera: I mean.

489
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.679
Orlando Sequera: can anybody give me an example of a stakeholder

490
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.870
Orlando Sequera: anyone that could impact or be infected by the project.

491
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.930
Orlando Sequera: I see some of you homeowners.

492
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:39.480
Orlando Sequera: state level governments, all Europeans, every driver, the population.

493
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:49.710
Orlando Sequera: all the employees, the customers, residents of Europe, Western and Eastern Europe. Exactly. And you guys are going exactly where I was going.

494
00:46:49.920 --> 00:47:01.540
Orlando Sequera: Exactly where I was going right. It's not only all European citizens. What about the people that travel from the Us. And Asia or Australia to Europe, and they're going to be using the highway, their stakeholders

495
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:06.570
Orlando Sequera: as well. They by that definition they can. They can be considered stakeholders.

496
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.520
Orlando Sequera: But

497
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.350
Orlando Sequera: guess what?

498
00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.500
Orlando Sequera: As a

499
00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:18.419
Orlando Sequera: as an organization, as a as a as a building organization, the organization that is building the actual highway.

500
00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:27.939
Orlando Sequera: We do not have unlimited resources we do not have. By that I mean, we do not have unlimited, and a limited amount of money and a limited amount of time.

501
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:39.229
Orlando Sequera: and we have to prioritize. We have to identify our key stakeholders for that highway. We have to go through this process so we can address that.

502
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:49.799
Orlando Sequera: So we need to focus on because and and the reason for that is because we don't have unlimited resources, so we need to be able to understand who the key stakeholders are, and

503
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.700
Orlando Sequera: go through this process off

504
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:57.790
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder, notification. And then the engagement aspect. But we start with

505
00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:01.960
Orlando Sequera: identifying who those stakeholders are, if we bring that

506
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.669
Orlando Sequera: the

507
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.749
Orlando Sequera: that that notion back to an organization

508
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:12.049
Orlando Sequera: going back to the example that I used yesterday your

509
00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:17.859
Orlando Sequera: A, the the project with a project that is developing a new software for the accounting department.

510
00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.500
Orlando Sequera: You need to start by identifying who your key stakeholders are.

511
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.259
Orlando Sequera: and you have to go through that process. That is about

512
00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.370
Orlando Sequera: that. That is

513
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:34.350
Orlando Sequera: crucial for your project. You need to work on your stakeholder. Identification Stakeholders come in many

514
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:40.599
Orlando Sequera: in many shapes, ways and forms. They They can come from

515
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:44.449
Orlando Sequera: multiple areas, and these are the typical

516
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:54.389
Orlando Sequera: project stakeholders that we have. These are a typical price stakeholders that we have. We have our end users. And in that example of the software for the accounting department.

517
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.600
Orlando Sequera: We have

518
00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.939
Orlando Sequera: a

519
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:03.600
Orlando Sequera: We have end users in in that. In that aspect it will be the accounting

520
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:14.690
Orlando Sequera: they're counting people working with the software. The end users. We have our customers, we have employees, is going to be the organization. We have functional managers, we have our sponsors.

521
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:15.800
Orlando Sequera: we have

522
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:21.530
Orlando Sequera: business partners. In some cases. If we're working with older

523
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:28.450
Orlando Sequera: third-party organizations, suppliers and contractors could be the government could be the community. So this is

524
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.020
Orlando Sequera: really

525
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:34.649
Orlando Sequera: important for us to define. Sometimes see in some situations is

526
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:40.480
Orlando Sequera: very straightforward. It is easy to identify. It is easy to

527
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.279
Orlando Sequera: A to

528
00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:47.859
Orlando Sequera: to pinpoint who the to to identify the stakeholders putting some environments is not that is it?

529
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:52.230
Orlando Sequera: It's really not that simple. So, working

530
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:58.259
Orlando Sequera: with a government, for example, when you're a government contractor, they the relationships are

531
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:12.509
Orlando Sequera: in some cases subtle, and you have to really understand who the actual who your end users are, Who your customer your customers are. They're not that clear card as it is in some other situation. So this is

532
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.259
Orlando Sequera: really it is really important.

533
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:16.549
Orlando Sequera: And

534
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.290
Orlando Sequera: we also

535
00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.670
Orlando Sequera: in the stakeholders. We have our team members, too.

536
00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:29.230
Orlando Sequera: They are internal stakeholders, so they're they're going to be. Consider as

537
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:45.559
Orlando Sequera: they're going to be. Consider a stakeholder so anybody that can impact or could be impacted by the project. Another aspect that we got to take into account about stakeholders is that they take on a variety of roles, and they have different responsibilities in the project. That's why we have to start by identifying who they are.

538
00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:48.869
Orlando Sequera: They include members of the project team

539
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.339
Orlando Sequera: customers and users.

540
00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.000
Orlando Sequera: business or project partners.

541
00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:06.929
Orlando Sequera: They may or may not be actively involved in project work. I'll give you an example. Going back to this software Development Project. We're developing a new software for the accounting department. We have

542
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:12.219
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders that are not necessarily going to be involved with project work

543
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.100
Orlando Sequera: like the it Department.

544
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.509
Orlando Sequera: they

545
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:29.269
Orlando Sequera: help desk is gonna provide support. Once we deploy the new software, the new accounting software to production. That's when the roll is gonna start. But there's still stakeholders. We gotta keep them.

546
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:41.030
Orlando Sequera: We we have to work with them. We gotta keep them engaged. We have to identify what's going to who those stakeholders are, and we gotta work with them. So it's not just about

547
00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:56.889
Orlando Sequera: the project. Work the the customers that we have. We have to keep an open mind, and we have to be very thorough to understand those different relationship we have. This is a make or break deal for your project. This is something important.

548
00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.000
Orlando Sequera: and this can be the cost for

549
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:06.709
Orlando Sequera: many issues, for many projects. If we don't know well a who this takes holders are

550
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:14.710
Orlando Sequera: A, and they change by the way, that because this is something the stakeholder notification is something that we have to perform

551
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.019
Orlando Sequera: in an ongoing basis in a project because people get

552
00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.600
Orlando Sequera: promote it. People quit. People get laid off

553
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:40.759
Orlando Sequera: changes. Change is going to be a constant in your project. So you need to try to keep your stakeholder register. By the way, which is a list of stakeholders a. Up to date at all times for your project. Otherwise that's a recipe for destruction. This is

554
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.399
Orlando Sequera: this is really

555
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.919
really crucial.

556
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.609
Orlando Sequera: and

557
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:47.750
Orlando Sequera: I,

558
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.480
Orlando Sequera: that I have for you here in this light.

559
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.260
Orlando Sequera: who were

560
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.560
Orlando Sequera: which are typically members of the project team.

561
00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:57.769
Orlando Sequera: This list that you see

562
00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.520
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to.

563
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:08.490
Orlando Sequera: Yes, the

564
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:25.339
Orlando Sequera: well, the employees, the sponsors, I see, and some of them are not they. The end users are not typically part of the project work and active, their employees, the customers and users. The sponsors should be active, ideally. Okay. So

565
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:29.360
Orlando Sequera: the goal here is to understand that stakeholders come in many

566
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:43.240
Orlando Sequera: waste ways shape Some forms. It's not just it. It's not really straightforward. In some cases we have to keep an open mind. We have to really perform a thorough identification process. Okay

567
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.049
Orlando Sequera: in

568
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.330
Orlando Sequera: as I was mentioning.

569
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:57.260
Orlando Sequera: Okay, great. But what what happens when we start identifying stakeholders? What do we do with that information? You might be wondering that might be a question.

570
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.229
Orlando Sequera: What

571
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:10.909
Orlando Sequera: are you, W. What are you? What? Where do we put that information right? We start identifying stakeholders, for example, for accounting a software project, we start identifying that

572
00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.929
Orlando Sequera: one of the key stakeholders is the director of accounting.

573
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:20.020
Orlando Sequera: Then we have the accounting manager, and then we start

574
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:30.529
Orlando Sequera: we are able to identify the the accounts, receivable accounts, payable people, and some other a employees or some other end users

575
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:36.549
Orlando Sequera: in the accounting department. Where do we put that information for that? As we

576
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:45.639
Orlando Sequera: start collecting that information, we're going to create an artifact or a document that we call a stakeholder register.

577
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:52.799
Orlando Sequera: It is simply a spreadsheet. That's what it is. It is a spreadsheet with the contact information.

578
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:57.790
Orlando Sequera: If of those stakeholders that we were able to identify, that's what it is

579
00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:06.969
Orlando Sequera: the director of accounting. That is the the position we need, the name. They contact information, phone number email, address.

580
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.569
Orlando Sequera: And also

581
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:20.909
Orlando Sequera: we can have a a field, a column in the spreadsheet about the expectations that they have about the project. We can do that, but it's just a running list of stakeholders. That's what we call the stakeholder register.

582
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.889
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and

583
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:33.850
Orlando Sequera: the they they mixed. And this is the first time we're going to see a plan here. We need to. Once we're able to identify them. We also need to work on

584
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.830
Orlando Sequera: creating a plan to keep them engaged.

585
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:44.699
Orlando Sequera: That is a critical aspect with our stakeholders. It's not just knowing who they are. We also need to keep them engaged.

586
00:55:44.760 --> 00:56:04.399
Orlando Sequera: We have ways for doing that. We have what we call the stakeholder engagement, assessment, matrix. We need to understand where they are, who they are. So we can prioritize, because not all stakeholders are created equal. We need to prioritize. And remember, we have limited resources. So we have to prioritize, and that's where we use

587
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:19.559
Orlando Sequera: this grids that you see here. We start looking at multiple dimensions, the power and interest. For example, we start using this model so we can place them, and we're gonna see that, so we so we can then

588
00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:31.080
Orlando Sequera: be as strategic as possible in engaging our stakeholders, for everything starts with identifying who they are, hey? And remember, this is something dynamic.

589
00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:38.300
Orlando Sequera: Stakeholders are changing all the time, as I mentioned before, people get promoted, people get laid off, people get transferred.

590
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:52.630
Orlando Sequera: or we merge with other organizations. That means that our stakeholders are going to change, so we have to constantly pay attention. That's why the environment we're what we started yesterday that's why it's so important.

591
00:56:52.730 --> 00:57:00.540
Orlando Sequera: If your organization merges with another organization or these acquired by another organization. If you're working the project

592
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:10.340
Orlando Sequera: and a good project manager, when you see that that's a red flag that will that should indicate automatically to you. Oh, my stakeholders can change. So

593
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:12.909
Orlando Sequera: I need to work

594
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:19.830
Orlando Sequera: with my sponsor to understand the impact of that merger, a process of that acquisition

595
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:33.169
Orlando Sequera: to see how to understand if our stakeholders are going to be changed. So those we need to be aware of our surroundings. I call that situational awareness for a project manager. That's why those ef

596
00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:51.759
Orlando Sequera: are so important. Okay, we need to always pay attention to your surroundings, especially when you're working in project management. Those changes reflect that changes my my stakeholders. I need to go ahead and review and validate that what I have in my stakeholder register is up to date.

597
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:56.400
Orlando Sequera: That is critical, important. Remember also remember that for the exempt.

598
00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:57.660
Okay.

599
00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:03.250
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to stakeholder identification we

600
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.589
Orlando Sequera: need to understand.

601
00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:12.789
Orlando Sequera: And and that's why we create the business case and benefits management plan.

602
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.630
Orlando Sequera: But that's gonna help us to navigate to have an idea who the stakeholders are

603
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.729
Orlando Sequera: right

604
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:19.839
Orlando Sequera: in.

605
00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:25.659
Orlando Sequera: We have to review other artifacts that are going to be created for other project

606
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:31.979
Orlando Sequera: and issue impediment slog, although that's also gonna give us an indication of

607
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.620
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholders

608
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:36.180
Orlando Sequera: a requirements documentation

609
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:45.889
Orlando Sequera: that is related to the scope of the project that also can give us an indication of stakeholders. But we need to understand who they are. And also

610
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.049
Orlando Sequera: we need to understand what is

611
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:54.260
Orlando Sequera: the relationship that they have with the project, the level of interest, the level of involvement that is needed

612
00:58:54.630 --> 00:59:02.759
Orlando Sequera: any intent interdependencies their influence. So someone like the director of accounting of the counting department.

613
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:21.220
Orlando Sequera: it's going to be a high interest and high influence type of stakeholder for your project. So we need to. We have to manage that in a certain way that we're going to see later. But you might have people from the it department. That is, in that case that's a little bit different.

614
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.149
Orlando Sequera: They are

615
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:39.370
Orlando Sequera: a the level of interest might not be as high, but we have to place them accordingly in some of the Grits, and we're going to see that a little bit later. But we need to get at least understand this information for every single stakeholder, because not all stakeholders

616
00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:48.960
Orlando Sequera: our created equal, as I mentioned, and we have to prioritize, and you might be wondering what Why, every single stakeholder is important. But remember what I mentioned at the beginning of today's session.

617
00:59:49.400 --> 01:00:06.639
Orlando Sequera: We do not have unlimited resources. We have a limited amount of time and a limited amount of money to complete our project. Okay, we don't have unlimited resources. Therefore we have to prioritize. We have to prioritize. And this is what

618
01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.689
Orlando Sequera: these processes of stakeholder identification is going to help us with. And also

619
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:16.060
Orlando Sequera: after that, the stakeholder a engagement model.

620
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:18.139
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we have to prioritize.

621
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:23.120
Orlando Sequera: We need to assess our stakeholders. These are some tools that you can use

622
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:36.959
Orlando Sequera: to understand and try to identify your stakeholders. As I mentioned before, stakeholders can come in any way, shape or form. Therefore you should use multiple tools and techniques to identify them

623
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.969
Orlando Sequera: with your team and your

624
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:41.340
Orlando Sequera: project sponsor.

625
01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.419
Orlando Sequera: or and even all the stakeholders that you have been able to

626
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.520
Orlando Sequera: identify already. Initially.

627
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.659
Orlando Sequera: you should use some data data gathering techniques.

628
01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.619
Orlando Sequera: send them questionnaires and send them surveys.

629
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.079
Orlando Sequera: and you might be wondering what if I don't have a template for that? Well.

630
01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:01.979
Orlando Sequera: first go to resource is going to be your Pmo.

631
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:08.949
Orlando Sequera: Or you should also check with other project managers there are gonna be in most cases most organizations have

632
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.110
Orlando Sequera: being through this process before, and you can leverage

633
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.299
Orlando Sequera: what's using the past, but if not, they're multiple

634
01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:29.770
Orlando Sequera: tools out the templates out there. Bmi, for example, has a great resource that's called pretty mentioned to come multiple templates for that. And also do brainstorming. This is simple. Get everyone in a room and

635
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:41.490
Orlando Sequera: start working on identifying stakeholders. You get this from from the team. Chances are that your team members have worked in similar projects before they can help you with this.

636
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:51.180
Orlando Sequera: and then you have to start analyzing who they are. These stakeholders? What are their stakes in the project? What are their interests, what are their rights?

637
01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.399
Orlando Sequera: A

638
01:01:52.480 --> 01:02:01.500
Orlando Sequera: what type of ownership, what is their level of contribution to start validating and analyzing who stakes older. The stakeholders are. Okay.

639
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.849
Orlando Sequera: And also this is

640
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:22.569
Orlando Sequera: another reason why we need to gather those opas. We have to review documentation depending on what we're doing. We have to review documentation. That's why we work with Opa as well. We have to perform document analysis, and that can help us to uncover possible stakeholders for our project.

641
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.050
Orlando Sequera: Once we analyze the stakeholders, the next step is to start

642
01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.660
Orlando Sequera: working.

643
01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.850
Orlando Sequera: AIM

644
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:35.069
Orlando Sequera: what I call intel for your stakeholders, we to

645
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:38.400
Orlando Sequera: classify the stakeholders we need to understand.

646
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:46.709
Orlando Sequera: We can classify them, and to to start prioritizing the level of power and interest that's one power of influence. These are dimensions

647
01:02:46.820 --> 01:03:00.579
Orlando Sequera: that based on the information that we gather we can place them in the quadrant. We're going to see an example of that. So we can then prioritize and understand who they are, and then prioritize, so we can. So we make sure that

648
01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:08.910
Orlando Sequera: number one. We know who they are. Number 2 that we're addressing the right priorities at the right time for our project. Okay, so these are ways

649
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:19.339
Orlando Sequera: to place them. This is information that it is that we have to to perform, and this is going to help us to be

650
01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:32.259
Orlando Sequera: a to be very, very, very a successful increase. The chances of sense for a project. We need to know who they are and we to analyze and place them so. We can then prioritize our stakeholders.

651
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.310
Orlando Sequera: But

652
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.470
Orlando Sequera: before we get to that.

653
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:56.750
Orlando Sequera: We start with creating this stakeholder register. But now we're gonna take our first break. We're gonna take our first break, and when we come back. We're gonna talk about the stakeholder register. I'm gonna show you an example of the stakeholder register what I mean by that spreadsheet. And we're gonna start seeing a live demonstration

654
01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.310
Orlando Sequera: of this of these topics. Okay.

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:15.729
Orlando Sequera: please do not. Post comments. Try to use the Q. A. Section for what it is. If you have technical issues.

672
01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:26.639
Orlando Sequera: please make sure that you start by stating whether you are a Per Cp. Or a number super, user like most of you are doing that. But it is important that you keep doing that and explain the

Orlando Sequera: issue that you're experiencing.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.609
Orlando Sequera: We have

675
01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:36.210
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to resources in the Q. A. If you go at the very top.

676
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.989

677
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:49.259
Orlando Sequera: you have the information on how to access your resources is there for both for CPU and non per CPU users. Okay.

678
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.540
Orlando Sequera: And one more thing about housekeeping.

679
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:53.879
Orlando Sequera: the

680
01:05:54.580 --> 01:06:14.000

Okay, and you can use it again for today, tomorrow on the rest of the the sessions that we have. That information is not gonna change. Please store it. Let's try to minimize the number of

681
01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:23.180
Orlando Sequera: repetitive questions, and one more time, if you already did a name check yesterday, you do not have to do it again today. Okay.

682
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.239
Orlando Sequera: you do not have to do it again today.

683
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:27.089
Orlando Sequera: All right.

684
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.069
Orlando Sequera: All right.

685
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.600
Orlando Sequera: Police. That's

686
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:32.960
Orlando Sequera: try to make it as

687
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.869
Orlando Sequera: as as good as possible for everyone as

688
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.129
Orlando Sequera: a

689
01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.150
Orlando Sequera: Let's try. Let's try to be. Let's try to help everyone.

690
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.390
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

691
01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:54.149
Orlando Sequera: let's try to help everyone with the flow of the class. This make it the best experience possible. Alright. So you do not have to do a name check if you already did it yesterday.

692
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.160
Orlando Sequera: All right.

693
01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.009
Orlando Sequera: okay.

694
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.179
Orlando Sequera: And let me take a look at

695
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.330
Orlando Sequera: before we continue. Let's go over some questions.

696
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.130
Orlando Sequera: a content, related questions. I'm going to start by reviewing the

697
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:14.569
Orlando Sequera: Q. And a. Remember that you can vote click on the

698
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:20.449
Orlando Sequera: thumbs up. They like button, so you can move it up to the top. I'm. Going to start by

699
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:25.219
Orlando Sequera: addressing those. There is a question here

700
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.080
Orlando Sequera: about

701
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:29.580
Orlando Sequera: the type of organizations

702
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.309
Orlando Sequera: with regards to those type of organization, functional matrix.

703
01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.919
Orlando Sequera: or project ties. It's actually projectized.

704
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:38.889
Orlando Sequera: How do I know?

705
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.009
Orlando Sequera: I'm sorry the question. I lost the question.

706
01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.580
Orlando Sequera: How do I know?

707
01:07:48.520 --> 01:08:02.059
Orlando Sequera: How am I able to identify when we first arrived to a new organization talking to people? Remember, if you're new to the organization, start asking questions to other project Managers

708
01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:13.399
Orlando Sequera: start asking questions. Try to understand that as quickly as possible. With what type of organization to talk to your peers. That will be my recommendation. Okay.

709
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:17.329
Orlando Sequera: they will be able to guide you and help you with that.

710
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:29.140
Orlando Sequera: There's another question. Top, that is content. Related is the stakeholder register, a list of stakeholders or key stakeholders. It's a list of stakeholders, and we're gonna get. I'm gonna show you

711
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.719
Orlando Sequera: an example

712
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.569
Orlando Sequera: of

713
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:37.149
Orlando Sequera: the list of stakeholders that we call the stakeholder register.

714
01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:47.600
Orlando Sequera: Do we have to identify key stakeholders? No, we have to identify stakeholders in general. But then we have to prioritize to know who the key stakeholders are okay.

715
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:53.920
Orlando Sequera: That's what we the step number one is to identify stakeholders. Then we have to prioritize that list.

716
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:55.700
Orlando Sequera: That step number 2

717
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.870
Orlando Sequera: with the stakeholder register.

718
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.769
Okay.

719
01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.719
and

720
01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.529
Orlando Sequera: okay, I'm going over.

721
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.579
Orlando Sequera: Let me just check to make sure.

722
01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:26.810
Orlando Sequera: What is the strategy? Another question in the Q. A: what is this strategy to develop storage and stakeholders communication communication. That is your job as a project manager.

723
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:44.320
Orlando Sequera: Introduce yourself to them face to face. Call them. It's not just sending an email, make sure that they know who you are. It's about communication in multiple ways. Okay, that is crucial. We're gonna talk about that in more detail throughout the class. But that's how

724
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.310
Orlando Sequera: we can do that.

725
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.080
Orlando Sequera: do. There's another quick. So

726
01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:54.570
Orlando Sequera: so that question, there's another question. Do all stakeholders need to be engaged.

727
01:09:54.610 --> 01:10:07.130
Orlando Sequera: We have to prioritize right. That's it. Going to make a little bit more sense once we cover the topic. But we have to identify who they are, and then we have to prioritize, so we can understand who the key stakeholders are, and

728
01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:11.590
Orlando Sequera: but some stakeholders need to be more engaged than others.

729
01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:15.189
Orlando Sequera: All right? So that's a really good question.

730
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:27.459
Orlando Sequera: Another question. That's experience as a program portfolio manager account, or the requirement for months.

731
01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.050
Orlando Sequera: Well, that's more about it.

732
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.830
Orlando Sequera: Application. Well, in essence.

733
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:37.190
Orlando Sequera: i'm going to venture to say yes in a way you were managing projects, so yes, I would say so

734
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.980
Orlando Sequera: right.

735
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:51.249
Orlando Sequera: reviewing the rest of the questions to see if we have anything else

736
01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:53.670
Orlando Sequera: about content.

737
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:59.020
Orlando Sequera: anything else related to Content.

738
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:23.759
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the Q. And a. Can the project sponsor? Lead the stakeholder register. No, you have to create the stakeholder registers not the sponsor.

739
01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:24.889
Orlando Sequera: That's

740
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.730
Orlando Sequera: your responsibility.

741
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:29.529
Orlando Sequera: You are the Pm. It's your project.

742
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:36.860
Orlando Sequera: What are the key points to the 5 key stakeholders.

743
01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:44.269
Orlando Sequera: Okay, do you do you have to ask people? Do brainstorming sessions work as your

744
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:56.259
Orlando Sequera: a team members ask the sponsor and look at the scope of the project that you're working right? So that's an review documentation, multiple tools, multiple techniques that you can use

745
01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.660
Orlando Sequera: to identify your stakeholders.

746
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:04.440
Orlando Sequera: And there was another question

747
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:11.730
that out

748
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.799
Orlando Sequera: that I see here, and it is.

749
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:31.859
Orlando Sequera: should certain stakeholders be at a different physical project. As I mentioned, this is an ongoing process. Stakeholders are going to be changing through the project. So you have to

750
01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:39.839
Orlando Sequera: okay review your stakeholder and they register throughout the entire project. Stakeholders change through other project.

751
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:51.549
Orlando Sequera: then will the key stakeholders not be added to a charter? No, the product chart is a totally different document. We do not add stakeholders to a charter. We have a stakeholder register for that.

752
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:55.979
Orlando Sequera: All right, let me review

753
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:56.889
the

754
01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.190
Orlando Sequera: chat

755
01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.870
Orlando Sequera: for questions.

756
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:06.200
Orlando Sequera: We're going to review the chat

757
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.490
That's the

758
01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:12.340
Orlando Sequera: B. And P. Test focus on stakeholders. Well, you.

759
01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:23.950
Orlando Sequera: as I mentioned the definition of a stakeholder, anyone that could impact or could be impacted by the project. But we need to identify the key stakeholders, and we create a list

760
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.769
Orlando Sequera: of stakeholders that we call the stakeholder register.

761
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:43.160
Orlando Sequera: But in the European Highway example you wouldn't engage American trials as much. Not really. We. We get a look at who's paying for that highway? Right? Those are your key stakeholders. That's a way to. So who's funding that

762
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:50.990
Orlando Sequera: that highway? That's where I will start. If I were to be the project manager, Those are my main customers right that the

763
01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:51.959
Orlando Sequera: all right

764
01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.870
Orlando Sequera: and

765
01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:58.750
Orlando Sequera: all right. And

766
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:08.309
Orlando Sequera: are there controls of stakeholder information?

767
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:14.070
Orlando Sequera: Well, it's one of the artifacts that you have to keep as a project manager. Okay

768
01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.580
Orlando Sequera: as a project manager, so you have to keep it.

769
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:20.900
Orlando Sequera: And this is going to change from projects to projects. You don't.

770
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:36.200
Orlando Sequera: We leave one a sample. There's another common in the chat for some projects. You want to sample pool of stakeholders, not just the closest people to it, not a sample you need to identify specifically who they are. Okay, You need to identify specifically who they are.

771
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:52.219
Orlando Sequera: And there's another coming in the chat in the European example. Consider the European Tourism Commerce Association. Yes. But again, who's funding that? I will start by doing that? Who's funding that pro that highway? And who

772
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:53.980
Orlando Sequera: right to

773
01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:02.800
Orlando Sequera: right to see who's vested in that project. That's what you need to understand. To find out to understand who the key stakeholders are for your project.

774
01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.550
Okay.

775
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:05.460
Orlando Sequera: all right.

776
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.980
Orlando Sequera: all right. So

777
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.050
Orlando Sequera: let's continue with the content. And this is an example of a stakeholder register.

778
01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.030
Orlando Sequera: It is nothing but a spreadsheet.

779
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.099
Orlando Sequera: It's nothing but a spreadsheet.

780
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:24.040
Orlando Sequera: Okay, this

781
01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:30.789
Orlando Sequera: and you also have an access in the to to this example in your Pdf

782
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:33.689
Orlando Sequera: version of the student materials.

783
01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.999
Orlando Sequera: This is a stakeholder register, as we start identifying. Who the stakeholders are.

784
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:44.169
Orlando Sequera: We have to enter that information in the spreadsheet.

785
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:45.110
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

786
01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:50.250
Orlando Sequera: And it is information about who they are. Their name, information, their name.

787
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:57.599
Orlando Sequera: The title is this an internal stakeholder? Or is it an external stakeholder? What is the role in the project?

788
01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:58.840
Orlando Sequera: What about

789
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:06.100
Orlando Sequera: their expectations and major requirements that they want to see a that are

790
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:20.039
Orlando Sequera: completed associated with the project. And what is their level of influence? Okay, what is their level of influence, and what is their or they're added to towards the program. Are they supporting the project?

791
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:27.690
Orlando Sequera: Are they neutral? Are they champion the project that My! That's code for sponsors right

792
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:32.869
Orlando Sequera: in some organizations. A pretty sponsor They also call in the champion the project champion.

793
01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:34.599
Orlando Sequera: But

794
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.080
Orlando Sequera: or are they resistors?

795
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.190
Orlando Sequera: What

796
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:42.550
Orlando Sequera: that? That's that's crucial for you to understand

797
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:50.849
Orlando Sequera: what is their attitude towards the project that is really key. And this example that we see here is tied up to the shop industries

798
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.669
Orlando Sequera: a lives lifestyle center.

799
01:16:55.930 --> 01:17:00.340
Orlando Sequera: So but you're gonna have one specific to your project. Okay.

800
01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:02.809
Orlando Sequera: it's going to be a.

801
01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:13.029
Orlando Sequera: This is this charge specific to the shop industry example that we covered yesterday, that we mentioned this sort of a life cycle center, the intergenerational center

802
01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:23.009
Orlando Sequera: that was been built in the oasis town and community. This is specific to a project. The stakeholder registers are always going to be specific to each project. Okay?

803
01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:42.639
Orlando Sequera: And this is again some information that you might have this can change. This is just a a a template, just an example. But you can add more information. You can app, for example, the communication type, another column, the common communication type. I will definitely do that I I use. I do that for my own projects.

804
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.220
Orlando Sequera: A and communication type, is

805
01:17:45.390 --> 01:18:00.389
Orlando Sequera: they, it's better to communicate with them through email is better to communicate them through a face to face it or a phone call, etc. I will add that the more enhanced you can have your stakeholder register, the better is going to be

806
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:02.369
Orlando Sequera: for you.

807
01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:03.940
Okay.

808
01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.710
Orlando Sequera: all right, so

809
01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:07.389
Orlando Sequera: is someone.

810
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:10.319
Orlando Sequera: Are they in favor of your.

811
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:18.760
Orlando Sequera: Are they in favor of your project? That's what we mean by by a resistor.

812
01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.910
Orlando Sequera: are they? I'm sorry. Are they against your project? That's what we mean by

813
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.249
Orlando Sequera: by every sister. All right.

814
01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.580
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

815
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:31.080
Orlando Sequera: this is just an example.

816
01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.300
Orlando Sequera: and

817
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:41.840
Orlando Sequera: this can be a little bit confusing and a little bit challenging

818
01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:53.529
Orlando Sequera: for some of you, especially the more complex the industries, and the larger the organization. This can be a little bit more cumbersome, and especially if you're working, for example, as a contracting company with

819
01:18:53.540 --> 01:19:05.879
Orlando Sequera: different levels of government, it can get really dense and not clear, but it is crucial. I have seen it first hand in with other project managers.

820
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:09.280
Orlando Sequera: especially if you're sort of starting their career

821
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:17.129
Orlando Sequera: that they didn't do a thorough a job in identifying their stakeholders, and that translated to

822
01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.580
Orlando Sequera: challenges for their projects

823
01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:25.059
Orlando Sequera: in in many, in many different areas. That's a really a

824
01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:32.889
Orlando Sequera: that's a recipe for destruction. You need to know who your stakeholders are. Add them to that list and understand

825
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:42.879
Orlando Sequera: specifically who they are. You need to have that information, and also you need to keep in mind that they, the stakeholders. The list of stakeholders changes

826
01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:45.790
Orlando Sequera: that changes over time.

827
01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.349
Okay.

828
01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:52.150
Orlando Sequera: and we are going to be able to. We need to be able to

829
01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:57.219
Orlando Sequera: understand that it is an ongoing. We do it at the beginning of the project, but

830
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:08.990
Orlando Sequera: it is an ongoing effort. Stakeholder notification we have. There's not a set formula to identify our stakeholders. We should do it every every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks. It sort of set formula for that.

831
01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:15.340
Orlando Sequera: But it is something that we have to do in a proactive manner. My

832
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:21.319
Orlando Sequera: recommendation would be, whenever you see a change in the environment.

833
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.500
Orlando Sequera: acquisition, merger, or

834
01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:26.870
Orlando Sequera: restructuring

835
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:41.230
Orlando Sequera: something of that magnitude that is happening at the organizational level. That's a red flag that should activate your your spiety senses as spider man you to be the product manager of spider-man.

836
01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:56.090
Orlando Sequera: That should activate your spider senses to oh, this can trigger some things happening. There's a major change here. This can trigger, possibly a change in stakeholders and review that and work with the people that are there to help you

837
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.309
Orlando Sequera: a

838
01:20:57.530 --> 01:21:06.960
Orlando Sequera: a couple of things that I I want to go back a couple of slides. So we have here in the example. We have the champions, the

839
01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.830
Orlando Sequera: supporters, and their resistors. So the champions are

840
01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:20.999
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders that are vested in the project, and they wanna make. They wanna make sure that it's probably get successful

841
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:39.950
Orlando Sequera: project sponsors. The product sponsor is the classic example of a champion. In some organizations they collaborate sponsor. That's what a champion is, someone that is best in the project, and wants to make sure that the project is successful. That should be your best go to individual. In this case we have.

842
01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:47.120
Orlando Sequera: We have a few. We have the sponsor, which is the CEO of the organization. Then we have

843
01:21:47.360 --> 01:22:03.289
Orlando Sequera: the principal of the organization, and we also have another champion, which is the which is a community of oasis, town community partnership. So leverage them. They can help you to make things happen. That's your first go to. But then you also have. We also have 2 kinds.

844
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:07.130
Orlando Sequera: You have some stakeholders that are

845
01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:17.239
Orlando Sequera: some Some stakeholders are our supporters. That's great. We can. We want to keep them as supporters. They're in favor of what you're trying to do.

846
01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:33.150
Orlando Sequera: and you also have some that are neutral there. Well, they they're not really. They don't really have a position. They're neutral. But then they once that you have to really work with. This is where I will start. If I were you. This is these are the ones that I will start

847
01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.979
Orlando Sequera: to understand. Why are in this specific example. Right? Why are

848
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:44.980
Orlando Sequera: the Why is the chair of the the of the

849
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:56.800
Orlando Sequera: every sister to a project? Why is she against our projects? Why she not neutral, not supportive. And why are the local residents not

850
01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.490
Orlando Sequera: supporting the project?

851
01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:08.230
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we, I will start my work as a project manager to understand. Where are they coming from? Why are they against my project? They may have some valid points

852
01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:13.690
Orlando Sequera: that we need to understand, but that is, that is crucial. Your job

853
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.420
Orlando Sequera: is ideally

854
01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.090
Orlando Sequera: to change their

855
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.959
Orlando Sequera: attitude towards your project, to turn this

856
01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.619
Orlando Sequera: into at least neutral

857
01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:31.600
Orlando Sequera: that should be your goal as a Pm. Do you start working with them. How do you do that, You leverage?

858
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.300
Orlando Sequera: You are sponsored, you leverage your champions

859
01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:40.800
Orlando Sequera: and you at you, and communicate with them, and try to understand where they come from.

860
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:46.480
Orlando Sequera: and we do that through communication. Okay, that is crucial. That is

861
01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.420
Orlando Sequera: a

862
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:51.719
Orlando Sequera: that is really, really, really important for you to

863
01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:55.610
Orlando Sequera: to do as a project manager. Okay, but this is the

864
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.829
Orlando Sequera: this is version: one

865
01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:59.219
Orlando Sequera: off your

866
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.390
Orlando Sequera: a work with your stakeholders

867
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:06.259
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder register. This is present State current state.

868
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:16.709
Orlando Sequera: Now that I know who they are, what are the have, all the information and the inference and attitude, I want to make sure that I am able to identify

869
01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.849
Orlando Sequera: who is supporting the project, who is not supporting the project, and also

870
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:23.780
Orlando Sequera: a

871
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:32.969
Orlando Sequera: I need to work on addressing those that are resistors. I need to work in addressing their concerns. They might have valid concerns.

872
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:50.209
Orlando Sequera: and we, I need to work with them. I will start by working with them to understand their their concerns and try to. Maybe there is some misinformation. There's some miscommunication, but they might have valid concerns and try to address that. That's part of your job as a project manager.

873
01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.469
Orlando Sequera: Okay? Then.

874
01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.180
Orlando Sequera: as we were.

875
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:58.210
Orlando Sequera: as as we were saying.

876
01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:12.750
Orlando Sequera: it's more about the Don't fall for that pit full of thinking that your stakeholders is just about their titles. Right? It's it's way way beyond that. Do you have to really

877
01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:16.569
Orlando Sequera: perform a thorough identification process

878
01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.519
Orlando Sequera: to understand who they are. It's not just

879
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:22.279
Orlando Sequera: the title right. We need to understand

880
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:28.280
Orlando Sequera: the level of authority. That is what we call the power, and that's not the same as the leadership.

881
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.650
Orlando Sequera: This is just the level of a 30.

882
01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:43.070
Orlando Sequera: Leadership is in the position of control given to individuals within an organization to foster a an effective and efficient function that is different. Authority is about

883
01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:45.019
Orlando Sequera: exercising power.

884
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.979
Orlando Sequera: Those of you that come from the military know that way better than me.

885
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.429
Orlando Sequera: A. With your Co. For example, right.

886
01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.500
Orlando Sequera: then

887
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:58.570
Orlando Sequera: authority is usually delegated to a person by a formal way. They have

888
01:25:58.690 --> 01:26:03.760
Orlando Sequera: the form of process, and it involves accountability

889
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:07.010
Orlando Sequera: or certain activities is their neck on the line

890
01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:11.259
Orlando Sequera: for the outcome of certain activities, then

891
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.289
Orlando Sequera: the mixed

892
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:16.780
Orlando Sequera: dimension that we have to look at is

893
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.540
Orlando Sequera: interest.

894
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:20.859
Orlando Sequera: What is their level of concern.

895
01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.300
Orlando Sequera: What is the level of concern? Is it high

896
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:31.960
Orlando Sequera: as in they might lose a contract? If this project fails right, or are they only

897
01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:38.229
Orlando Sequera: they are they only going to suffer a no direct impact

898
01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.560
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the outcome of the project.

899
01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.599
Orlando Sequera: An example will be the software. For the accounting department, right?

900
01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:51.690
Orlando Sequera: The director of accounting the accounting department. That's a direct impact that is high.

901
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:53.650
Orlando Sequera: a high interest, right?

902
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.630
Orlando Sequera: This individual wants to make sure this probably gets successful, but we might also have

903
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.870
Orlando Sequera: the director of it.

904
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:02.580
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily.

905
01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:08.189
Orlando Sequera: It's not a direct impact on it. The outcome of this project

906
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:13.150
Orlando Sequera: some ways it's gonna affect the entire organization, but it's not a direct impact. So that's what we mean by in

907
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:18.240
Orlando Sequera: then the level of influence. That's another dimension.

908
01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.900
Orlando Sequera: This is

909
01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:25.049
Orlando Sequera: their ability, the ability of the stakeholder to make an impact

910
01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.290
Orlando Sequera: on

911
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.520
Orlando Sequera: the project

912
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.520
Orlando Sequera: or the work of the project team. So

913
01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:39.269
Orlando Sequera: so we can understand. That is the impact to make, to have an influence on the outcomes or make changes right? That's what we call influence.

914
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.599
Orlando Sequera: And this is where we use based on the level of influence. This is where we use these terms.

915
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:50.659
Orlando Sequera: These are just suggestions, but this can change from organization to organization. This is where we

916
01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:55.890
Orlando Sequera: it, where we have the the champions, the supporters, and

917
01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:58.330
Orlando Sequera: the neutrals, or detractors.

918
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:00.520
Orlando Sequera: Right? So

919
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:04.639
Orlando Sequera: this is something that changes from project to project.

920
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:07.909
Orlando Sequera: Of course, similar situations in the that you have

921
01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:26.859
Orlando Sequera: experience in the past can be a good starting point. But you have to tailor this to your project. Every project is unique. Every project is different. Make sure that you, tailor that to your specific project, because stakeholders might not be the same. Stakeholders are always changing. It's a dynamic.

922
01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:32.470
Orlando Sequera: It it's a dynamic process. The stakeholders are always changing. Change is going to be a constant okay.

923
01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.610
Orlando Sequera: So it is

924
01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:40.190
Orlando Sequera: very important that we know who they are. And once we have this information in your

925
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:47.740
Orlando Sequera: and your stakeholder in in your stakeholder register, the next step is going to be

926
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:53.520
Orlando Sequera: to start analyzing those stakeholders. And this is what I was mentioning Before

927
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.249
Orlando Sequera: we have to start

928
01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.019
Orlando Sequera: getting that intel

929
01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.130
Orlando Sequera: about our stakeholders. We have to start prioritizing

930
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.809
Orlando Sequera: our stakeholders

931
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.380
Orlando Sequera: to understand.

932
01:29:07.150 --> 01:29:23.849
Orlando Sequera: How can we prioritize them? And we can rearrange our stakeholder registered to version 2. For example, once we are able to perform, this type of analysis. This is what we do with stakeholder mapping. Okay, once we have that information about the

933
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:31.179
Orlando Sequera: level of power and the level of interest or the level of power and the level of influence. We can start mapping them

934
01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.899
Orlando Sequera: in this grid.

935
01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:38.979
Orlando Sequera: And we, for example, if we have let's, assume for a minute that we're talking about the

936
01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:43.119
Orlando Sequera: project for the new software for the accounting department.

937
01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:44.670
Orlando Sequera: They

938
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:50.120
Orlando Sequera: director of accounting right. That is, someone that has high power

939
01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:52.190
Orlando Sequera: because it is a director.

940
01:29:52.210 --> 01:29:57.259
Orlando Sequera: It's an upper management. It's a director, so it's high power. And what about the interest?

941
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:59.770
Orlando Sequera: Is the director of accounting?

942
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:03.249
Orlando Sequera: It's also high interest. So if we look at

943
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:05.590
Orlando Sequera: the the

944
01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:06.740
Orlando Sequera: the grid.

945
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:14.020
Orlando Sequera: that stakeholder will fall here under, manage closely. That means that

946
01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:15.560
Orlando Sequera: he's gonna go to the

947
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:16.450
Orlando Sequera: top

948
01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:18.379
Orlando Sequera: of our stakeholder register.

949
01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.580
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that means that whenever

950
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.820
Orlando Sequera: we get

951
01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:27.319
Orlando Sequera: a phone call or an email or

952
01:30:28.230 --> 01:30:29.260
Orlando Sequera: a

953
01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:42.820
Orlando Sequera: a request for communication or a question from the stakeholder, we have to manage that closely. We have to be proactive in it, and be on top a. On on top of the the request that that these

954
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:52.129
Orlando Sequera: key stakeholder has. This is how you're going to know who your State do key stakeholders are, but you might have someone like the director of it.

955
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:54.500
Orlando Sequera: That is someone that is

956
01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.259
Orlando Sequera: high power, right?

957
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:57.290
Orlando Sequera: But

958
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:58.370
Orlando Sequera: they

959
01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:00.440
Orlando Sequera: The level of interest

960
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:04.160
Orlando Sequera: in the project is rather low.

961
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:06.959
Orlando Sequera: He's not necessarily under his realm.

962
01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:20.100
Orlando Sequera: A is not they? They're not calling the shots when it comes to accounting. So those stakeholders we want to keep them satisfied. It's not that we're ignoring them, for we're just trying to prioritize right? So I have

963
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:25.159
Orlando Sequera: you. You're trying to prioritize and rank your stakeholders. But then you have

964
01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:38.209
Orlando Sequera: some other stakeholders like the people, for example, that work in accounts payable, and accounts receivable for the the accounting department. They have low power.

965
01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:46.150
Orlando Sequera: but they have a high interest in the project. They're the ones that they're your end users. They're the ones that are going to be using

966
01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.330
Orlando Sequera: your

967
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:51.650
Orlando Sequera: your your software, your accounting, software we need to keep them informed.

968
01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.390
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we need to keep them informed.

969
01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:59.779
Orlando Sequera: And then we also have some other type of users like, for example, the help desk held this people.

970
01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:02.559
Orlando Sequera: the multiple levels that you have in the help desk.

971
01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:04.389
Orlando Sequera: They are low power

972
01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:12.640
Orlando Sequera: and they are low interest. They're gonna be They're gonna be supporting the application once it goes live, we have to monitor their a.

973
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:18.460
Orlando Sequera: their their expectations. Basically, so this is how we can prioritize and

974
01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.100
Orlando Sequera: be able to come up with a with a.

975
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:42.169
Orlando Sequera: With a system with an approach that is going to help us to understand, to prioritize our stakeholders and make sure that we are diverting our efforts to address the right priorities with the stakeholders. One thing that I wanted to point out I am not saying by no means that low power stakeholders are not important

976
01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:52.369
Orlando Sequera: that those that we have to monitor or let alone those that are a low power and high interest are not important. I'm. No, i'm not saying that they're not important.

977
01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.510
Orlando Sequera: Actually.

978
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:56.639
Orlando Sequera: actually, i'm gonna i'm gonna give you a

979
01:32:57.410 --> 01:33:00.509
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna go a little bit beyond beyond this They

980
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:08.630
Orlando Sequera: users your end users. They are in for important stakeholders. They're the ones that are going to be using the application.

981
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:09.790
Orlando Sequera: and

982
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:11.450
Orlando Sequera: they're the ones.

983
01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:17.139
Orlando Sequera: This is pretty management. It's about it's about building relationships

984
01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:22.540
Orlando Sequera: working with your stakeholders. The key aspect is to be able to build relationships.

985
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:26.660
Orlando Sequera: you wanna and it's also about earning trust.

986
01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:35.790
Orlando Sequera: earning trust building relationships. How can you earn trust? Let's assume that this is the first time that you work with this director of accounting?

987
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:38.170
Orlando Sequera: They don't know you. They don't know who you are.

988
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:50.450
Orlando Sequera: That nice to meet you, Mr. Orlando. Nice to meet you, ma'am, or Mr. Never work before with that individual. This is your project. So they don't know you, but guess what they know their people.

989
01:33:50.560 --> 01:34:01.549
Orlando Sequera: They know the accounts, payables. It comes with several people. They know their people, they trust them. So this is the way it works in real life. You want to build relationships with

990
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:04.979
Orlando Sequera: the people that are going to be using your product service of result.

991
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.040
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you address

992
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:14.030
Orlando Sequera: they their concerns, and you communicate with them. You keep them engaged, if they like, what you're doing with your project.

993
01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:21.299
Orlando Sequera: That's how you build. Trust with your key stakeholders with that with that sponsor.

994
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:26.910
Orlando Sequera: That's how you build. Trust with them. It is crucial. It is crucial. Okay. And

995
01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:46.290
Orlando Sequera: but we have to prioritize. We have to know who they are. We have to do this intel work so we can place our different stakeholders to understand who they are, because they're not all created equal, and you might want to validate who they are. You might have, for example, and I've been in that situation. I had an executive one time that

996
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:58.279
Orlando Sequera: turn out to be someone that was high power, but it turned out to be low interest in the project, but yet wanted to give input that wasn't really his place at that moment.

997
01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:07.729
Orlando Sequera: And what I did is I work with my sponsor that leverage my sponsor. Remember, we're diplomats, we're not. We have to work with people to make sure

998
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:22.599
Orlando Sequera: we leverage a sponsor. I leverage my sponsor that helped me to a address the concerns, and pretty much to for that particular stakeholder to understand, to pretty much so, so he could stay in his lane at that particular time. So

999
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:30.719
Orlando Sequera: it is important that we perform this Intel. This is going to be changing this. This is also dynamic stakeholders change, and

1000
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.690
Orlando Sequera: as stakeholders change, we have to also

1001
01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:40.799
Orlando Sequera: perform this validation with stakeholder mapping. We have to understand who they are, and we have to validate that. Okay.

1002
01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.559
Orlando Sequera: So this is crucial. This is really, really really important.

1003
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:48.710
Orlando Sequera: all right. And

1004
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.569
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the directions of influence

1005
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.239
Orlando Sequera: this is this: can go

1006
01:35:56.390 --> 01:36:08.230
Orlando Sequera: upward with the brand organization that's upper management senior management. We can be them work, they the project hierarchy. This will be the team, the correct team members or specialists.

1007
01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.059
Orlando Sequera: It can be outward.

1008
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:29.920
Orlando Sequera: It can be work when we talk about your If your your suppliers or other organizations outside of the project team, like suppliers or departments, or end users regulators like the FDA in my example, yesterday, or it could be side work. Right? These are your peers, your

1009
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:34.210
Orlando Sequera: all the project managers or middle managers that are

1010
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:54.140
Orlando Sequera: in competition for resources, because that that's where projects and we're gonna say. And and operations come together when it comes to resources, we're Still, we're we're competing for resources right? Remember what we said. We have limited resources that that we're all competing for. Okay. So that is.

1011
01:36:54.150 --> 01:37:10.740
Orlando Sequera: that is crucial. We need to understand that influence. That's the actual, as they call it here. This the best name for it, the social network of your project stakeholders. We need to understand who they are in some organizations. This is clear, then it is in some other organizations.

1012
01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:15.279
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to. I think I showed this in

1013
01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.790
Orlando Sequera: a another

1014
01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:23.820
Orlando Sequera: in one of the questions, what is the salience model? And this is what it is. This is another way to

1015
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:28.179
Orlando Sequera: map your stakeholders to understand, based on

1016
01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.209
Orlando Sequera: 3 dimensions.

1017
01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.800
Orlando Sequera: Do you look at the level of authority

1018
01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.179
Orlando Sequera: which is power.

1019
01:37:35.230 --> 01:37:40.740
Orlando Sequera: then their immediate needs, which is urgency, and also

1020
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.350
Orlando Sequera: how appropriate their involvement in terms of

1021
01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.799
Orlando Sequera: the project

1022
01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:47.929
Orlando Sequera: is which is what we call legitimacy.

1023
01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:56.449
Orlando Sequera: Okay, these are 3. This is a three-dimensional model that you can use to validate your stakeholders

1024
01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:12.419
Orlando Sequera: there's some variations of this salience model. It's not always urgency, legitimacy and power. There's some variations that they substitute proximity for legitimacy, but it's basically the same process and you're trying to understand what you're doing with this

1025
01:38:12.610 --> 01:38:26.730
Orlando Sequera: models with this script. This is a 3D one the power and influence is a two-dimensional one. You're trying to understand. You're trying to map your stakeholders, understand who they are, a

1026
01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.769
Orlando Sequera: and validate

1027
01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:48.609
Orlando Sequera: validate their legitimacy, validate the the understand the power. Send your urgency into work right? So you know who you're not only know who your stakeholders are, but where do they fit in that social network of stakeholders that you have in the organization. This is critical. This is important for you.

1028
01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:50.410
Orlando Sequera: Why? Because

1029
01:38:50.940 --> 01:39:00.929
Orlando Sequera: you have to prioritize, you have to be able to prioritize, and these are the tools that are going to help you to prioritize when it comes to your stakeholders. Okay.

1030
01:39:01.150 --> 01:39:03.450
Orlando Sequera: this is really important.

1031
01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:04.670
Orlando Sequera: then

1032
01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:09.750
Orlando Sequera: this.

1033
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.689
Orlando Sequera: It's something that we can escape from they. Our stakeholders are gonna have

1034
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:18.500
Orlando Sequera: their own perceptions.

1035
01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.199
Orlando Sequera: and, as you know.

1036
01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.530
Orlando Sequera: perceptions

1037
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:33.240
Orlando Sequera: can be damaging. They can be negative or they can be positive. That's why I was mentioning before. This is about building trust, earning trust.

1038
01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:38.799
Orlando Sequera: and it's about building relationships with your stakeholders.

1039
01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:54.489
Orlando Sequera: And when we were mapping the stakeholders, they once that we have to keep informed their low power. Oh, low power! I don't care about them. They're low power. No, no! You trying to build relationships with those those stakeholders, and you're trying to build as much as possible

1040
01:39:54.590 --> 01:40:05.720
Orlando Sequera: a good perception of positive per perception that's going to help you. That's going to help you. How do you do that? You can is through communication. Okay? So you get a

1041
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:08.100
Orlando Sequera: one approach that is

1042
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:12.760
Orlando Sequera: going to help you with that is to perform.

1043
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:24.900
Orlando Sequera: to do a holistic approach. A. That is customer, centric. That's why so important to understand who our customers are. Us all in any project. Always ask yourself and

1044
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:44.210
Orlando Sequera: ask your team members that question. We understand well who the who our customers are. In some cases, As I said before, it's going to be very straightforward, but in some other cases it's not going to be that straightforward. We need to understand. Who are they who our customers are, and we're come building that positive.

1045
01:40:44.220 --> 01:41:04.060
Orlando Sequera: that positive perception. Okay, that is, that is something that can affect your project. And once you have, if you have a negative perception with you. Start making promises that you can that you cannot deliver, and that's what I mean. That can be damaging. That can be negative for for your project, and they can.

1046
01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:22.610
Orlando Sequera: They can have a a a major impact so kind of work on. But we to understand who they are, address them in a way that it's going to be positive for your project. Try to work on as much as possible. A. To create a positive perception.

1047
01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:26.630
Orlando Sequera: And

1048
01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:29.260
Orlando Sequera: how do we build

1049
01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:46.399
Orlando Sequera: those relationships with our stakeholders. Now that we know who they are, we understand we were able to analyze them. We have all day intel, we know they are. We know their level of power level of legitimacy. They we know all the information we have been classified so

1050
01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:48.450
Orlando Sequera: great. What do I do now

1051
01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:54.489
Orlando Sequera: I need to start building trust with them. I need to start building those relationships with them.

1052
01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.579
Orlando Sequera: We have to use communication for that.

1053
01:41:57.630 --> 01:42:00.280
Orlando Sequera: We need to use communication.

1054
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:07.159
Orlando Sequera: That's the vehicle that is going to allow us to understand, to get their feedback. Get the perceptions in

1055
01:42:07.890 --> 01:42:20.960
Orlando Sequera: we in, and that that's how we we can start working the solid ground for our project. Okay, this is also gonna help your team members to understand what the customer wants for our project

1056
01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:25.959
Orlando Sequera: that their perceptions. It's also going to help you to build those relationships

1057
01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:27.360
Orlando Sequera: with your

1058
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:30.329
Orlando Sequera: A with your customers, with your stakeholders.

1059
01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.400
Orlando Sequera: and

1060
01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:32.969
Orlando Sequera: ultimately

1061
01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:35.630
Orlando Sequera: eventually build trust with them.

1062
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:43.739
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and it's a little bit more than just communication. It's a little bit more than just communication. You are gonna be working with people.

1063
01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:47.680
Orlando Sequera: So your team members and also your stakeholders.

1064
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:55.569
Orlando Sequera: As we are here working with this class, you have to use emotional intelligence. We're gonna talk about that in detail. But just to give you a brief

1065
01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:02.590
Orlando Sequera: overview of what emotional intelligence it boils down to not letting your emotions

1066
01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:08.730
Orlando Sequera: dictate your actions. Okay, not letting your emotions dictate your actions

1067
01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.809
Orlando Sequera: thinking before we speak, especially when the motions are high. That's what we mean by much of intelligence.

1068
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:26.790
Orlando Sequera: A. It's also about active listening that tied up to communication and interpersonal skills. Right? So we have to be diplomats. We have to network with people, we it's

1069
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:30.919
Orlando Sequera: actively sending paying attention to what they say, and

1070
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:32.670
Orlando Sequera: basically.

1071
01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:48.490
Orlando Sequera: being able to communicate and work well with others. And of course, multiple a communication methods. It's not just sending an email or just making a phone call, leaving a voicemail. No, I need if you have to send smoke signals, same smoke signals. So

1072
01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:50.840
Orlando Sequera: it is important to understand

1073
01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:54.030
Orlando Sequera: from the key stakeholders. What is there

1074
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:57.030
Orlando Sequera: project requirement? The pre requirements that they have

1075
01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:04.759
Orlando Sequera: and their communication preferences. So, going back to the example of the software? For accounting, understand what is

1076
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:17.989
Orlando Sequera: the communication? Preference for them? Is an email? If it is it instant messaging? Is it a phone call, or is it face to face? It is important for us to understand that we're key stakeholders, and

1077
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:27.769
Orlando Sequera: we'll take stakeholders, the rest of them. We can have regular project communications, and in some cases this is where we have those project status, information or meetings.

1078
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:29.130
Orlando Sequera: and then

1079
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:44.850
Orlando Sequera: to reach out to large to large groups. You want to leverage other tools that you're not gonna have time to have a a one on one interview with every single stakeholder. If your project has hundreds of them right, so some cases you can send that questioner surveys.

1080
01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:50.760
Orlando Sequera: You can have sessions that are brainstorming sessions that you can even use.

1081
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:55.329
Orlando Sequera: Hmm, digital media like email campaigns, websites, group chats.

1082
01:44:55.430 --> 01:45:02.780
Orlando Sequera: posters or advertising, but multiple ways. But the goal is to capture that feedback and perceptions from your stakeholders.

1083
01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:04.389
Orlando Sequera: All right

1084
01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:05.769
Orlando Sequera: in.

1085
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.230
Orlando Sequera: It is

1086
01:45:09.250 --> 01:45:22.540
Orlando Sequera: extremely important, as I mentioned before. How can we keep our stakeholders engaged in? The answer is through communication. But we need to be strategic about that. We have to plan

1087
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:25.959
Orlando Sequera: on how we're going to communicate with those stakeholders.

1088
01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:30.500
Orlando Sequera: We have 2 plans that are that are gonna work hand in hand.

1089
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:31.790
Orlando Sequera: We have

1090
01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.699
Orlando Sequera: one. That is

1091
01:45:34.150 --> 01:45:36.250
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholder engagement plan.

1092
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:40.729
Orlando Sequera: and this this plan is going to help us to come up with strategies

1093
01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.549
Orlando Sequera: to keep our stakeholders engage. Once

1094
01:45:44.730 --> 01:45:47.469
Orlando Sequera: we know that if the information

1095
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:52.440
Orlando Sequera: once we identify our stakeholders, and we have all that intel about them.

1096
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:56.490
Orlando Sequera: Then we have to come up with an engagement plan. Okay for

1097
01:45:56.650 --> 01:46:00.500
Orlando Sequera: these. These are these are the preference that we have to keep them engaged.

1098
01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:04.980
Orlando Sequera: We have to work with them. These are the prefer communication methods.

1099
01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:16.659
Orlando Sequera: We need this concert to be engaged with our project heavily engaged with our project. We gotta build that for us. Build a trust with them. We keep them engaged at all times. Some other stakeholders. You don't need.

1100
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:25.859
Orlando Sequera: They don't need to be engaged at all times. We we with the project team, but some of them you do so you have to strategize and come up with a

1101
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:37.200
Orlando Sequera: best way possible. The best Friday is possible to keep them engaged throughout the project, so they know that when you need information from them, they are available, and you have to coordinate that with them. But you have to plan for that, and

1102
01:46:37.210 --> 01:46:47.210
Orlando Sequera: and it goes hand in hand with the communications management plan. This is another plan that we have, and these 2, by the way, are part of our overall project management plan.

1103
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.389
Orlando Sequera: But the Communications management plan goes into a little more detail about the type of communications

1104
01:46:53.460 --> 01:47:08.379
Orlando Sequera: that communication strategies that we're gonna follow in our project. So we have to work on planning for that developing strategies for communication as well. So stakeholder and communications are areas that are closely related because

1105
01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:17.720
Orlando Sequera: we keep our stakeholders engage through communication. Okay, really important. And for that we have to also analyze our

1106
01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:18.780
Orlando Sequera: A.

1107
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:21.900
Orlando Sequera: The requirements that they have for communication.

1108
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.639
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand

1109
01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:29.630
Orlando Sequera: what the requirements are for communication. This is going to help us to.

1110
01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:32.880
Orlando Sequera: They understand their communicational needs.

1111
01:47:33.190 --> 01:47:42.979
Orlando Sequera: and this might sound trivial. You might think. Well, maybe we have more. Most people all people use use, email, or we can send a text. No, but we need to understand

1112
01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.730
Orlando Sequera: what works best for each stakeholder.

1113
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:55.730
Orlando Sequera: Do not Don't do ever assume that just oh, I sent an email. That's it. No, that's bad. Project management there, that's only one communication method. A

1114
01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:11.729
Orlando Sequera: phone calls face to face. Interview you need to is your job to decipher what works best with your stakeholders, especially with the key stakeholders. You need to figure that out and tell you that for my own experience

1115
01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:27.639
Orlando Sequera: that's a crucial aspect, especially with key stakeholders from those that you need, input from if it you need to decipher what works best for them. Is it email? Is it instant messaging? Is it a a a phone call? It's it a face to face interview.

1116
01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:44.080
Orlando Sequera: You need to figure that out. They're not gonna it's not their job to communicate with you. It's the other way around. If your project you are the project manager. So that's how you're going. That's why you have to perform this communication requirements. Analysis. This is how you're going to be able to

1117
01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:53.180
Orlando Sequera: be able to determine the frequency, the models and technologies. This is how you can plan to be effective and successful, and

1118
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:54.660
Orlando Sequera: it's basically

1119
01:48:54.770 --> 01:49:10.249
Orlando Sequera: as simple as a question or asking them questions. What is your prefer communication method, and how frequent would you like to? What frequency would you like to to have for communications, and how frequently do you want to get status reports

1120
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:20.319
Orlando Sequera: on your project? etc.? That's where you're gonna be asking those questions. And once you have that information, you should add that to your stakeholder register. So that's a that's an important.

1121
01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.459
Orlando Sequera: That's an important topic. All right.

1122
01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:26.350
Orlando Sequera: all right. So we are ready for

1123
01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:28.409
Orlando Sequera: our next break.

1124
01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:36.039
Orlando Sequera: and we're gonna take a 10 min break when we come back. We're gonna continue with the content. And we are

1125
01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:38.590
Orlando Sequera: going to

1126
01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:40.459
Orlando Sequera: answer some of the questions.

1127
01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:42.600
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to continue

1128
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:44.000
Orlando Sequera: with the company.

1129
01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.710
Orlando Sequera: Enjoy your break. Thank you very much, everyone.

1130
01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:25.610
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with the class.

1131
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:27.679
Orlando Sequera: Hopefully. You enjoyed your break.

1132
01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.410
Orlando Sequera: and I would like to address

1133
01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:35.099
Orlando Sequera: some of the questions that we have.

1134
01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:44.249
Orlando Sequera: Remember, Content related questions. Use the Q. A. And vote on them. Okay, i'm gonna go and answer the ones

1135
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.079
Orlando Sequera: that have the most votes.

1136
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:52.690
Orlando Sequera: And

1137
01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.170
Orlando Sequera: okay

1138
01:50:55.190 --> 01:50:56.639
Orlando Sequera: from the Q. A.

1139
01:50:56.690 --> 01:50:59.809
Orlando Sequera: Is it risky to label someone at Resistor

1140
01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.950
Orlando Sequera: on a report that could spill

1141
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:06.530
Orlando Sequera: outside of the project

1142
01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:09.400
Orlando Sequera: outside of the Pmo team.

1143
01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:14.080
Orlando Sequera: Great question. Thank you for asking this question.

1144
01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.209
Orlando Sequera: this type of stakeholder identification process

1145
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:25.779
Orlando Sequera: and also stakeholder analysis. This is something that we have to keep.

1146
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:27.160
Orlando Sequera: This is

1147
01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:30.310
Orlando Sequera: intel that we have to keep

1148
01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:41.089
Orlando Sequera: a I don't want to say secret, but we have to make sure that only the team, and if there's a pmo they can have

1149
01:51:41.150 --> 01:51:57.960
Orlando Sequera: access to that information. But this is definitely something that will never share with our E. With the, with, the with the external stakeholders. I will never share a stakeholder register information. This is your analysis. This is your Intel, and

1150
01:51:58.970 --> 01:52:02.439
Orlando Sequera: this is something that can help other projects in the future

1151
01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:06.969
Orlando Sequera: A. With lessons learned. But this is something that you have to keep internal

1152
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:18.910
Orlando Sequera: for the team. This is part of that intel. I would ensure this stakeholder registers. Of course it's not that anything bad is going to be there, but I wouldn't share this information outside of the

1153
01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:38.079
Orlando Sequera: project team or the Pmo. If there is a Pmo in place so great question, so that's how you address, or you mitigate that risk. Yes, it is risky. I wouldn't share that with the whole world. I will keep it contained just to the project team and to the Pmo. So all the projects in the future can leverage

1154
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:52.489
Orlando Sequera: that lesson learned. That's one document that we had that we can review from similar products in the past in the lessons for repository of the organization. So that's a great question. Thank you for asking that question. So

1155
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:55.049
Orlando Sequera: we keep it contained.

1156
01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:07.509
Orlando Sequera: There's another question. I am not seeing a big difference between the 2 plans, stakeholder, engagement and communication management, plus they are in the past to your point. They were. Consider one

1157
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:20.800
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder stakeholder management was part of communication there. But they are 2 different things we need to stakeholders are so important. It is a key aspect

1158
01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:27.950
Orlando Sequera: over time Pm. I realized, and for the management practitioners realized that stakeholder was

1159
01:53:27.970 --> 01:53:35.620
Orlando Sequera: a separate area, even though they're closely related. But it was its own separate area. We have to identify. We have to analyze.

1160
01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.630
Orlando Sequera: and

1161
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:39.019
Orlando Sequera: the engagement portion.

1162
01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:48.360
Orlando Sequera: We do that for communication. But we need a specific plan. It is a key aspect we have to make sure that we dot all the eyes and cross all the Ts

1163
01:53:48.630 --> 01:54:06.689
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to our stakeholders. That's why we have a separate plan because it's a key area that can derail our our projects. If we don't have a the right stakeholders identified, and if we don't have the stakeholders engage through other projects. So they are 2 separate areas. Of course

1164
01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:22.110
Orlando Sequera: the vehicle for stakeholder engagement is communication. They are still closely related. But you need 2 different plans to make sure that you cover all the basis. That's why that's why we have it a separate plan. So for the exam.

1165
01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:32.929
Orlando Sequera: Assume that you have 2 separate plans. Can that changing in an organization? Yes, but for the Pmp. Exam purposes they are 2 separate plans. Great question.

1166
01:54:34.050 --> 01:54:34.960
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1167
01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:40.099
Orlando Sequera: There's another question

1168
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:45.539
Orlando Sequera: to. We need to.

1169
01:54:46.970 --> 01:55:02.900
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Really a question from the Q. A. Do we need to in to make this stakeholder as you mentioned? Or should it be available publicly. We should, as I mentioned before the case, the stakeholder register should be contained to the product team and the Pm. MoD. You don't want to share that

1170
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:13.870
Orlando Sequera: with everyone. It it it should be contained, of course, if the sponsor would like to see it. Yes, but do you have to keep it contain not, it's not to share with with everyone

1171
01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:16.960
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1172
01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.260
Orlando Sequera: Our internal regulations.

1173
01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.679
Orlando Sequera: by our our internal regulations, consider Eefs.

1174
01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:41.679
Orlando Sequera: It's in turn to the organization. Those are internal policies. I would say that you're talking about internal policies with the organization. That is an example of an organizational process asset, not an ef

1175
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:43.790
Orlando Sequera: It's an organization or process asset.

1176
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:53.649
Orlando Sequera: There's another question in the chat. Should certain stakeholders be added at different faces of the project.

1177
01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:03.390
Orlando Sequera: it's not that they need to be added. We need to perform the stakeholder identification process in an ongoing basis.

1178
01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:14.689
Orlando Sequera: They are going to be some events. If there are any changes in the organization. There are going to be some events that trigger that should trigger that stakeholder identification process. But

1179
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:24.289
Orlando Sequera: it's not necessarily that they need to be at a different fixes of project you have to throughout the entire life cycle of the project. If you get hold of any

1180
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:28.039
Orlando Sequera: event or any trigger that could have an impact

1181
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:34.609
Orlando Sequera: on changing the stakeholders. For example, merger on acquisition, layoff

1182
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:38.370
Orlando Sequera: promotion changes in the organization. Then

1183
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.540
Orlando Sequera: you should review and validate your stakeholder register.

1184
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:43.630
Orlando Sequera: All right

1185
01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:49.900
Orlando Sequera: do our stakeholders change if we're dealing with the waterfall versus a major project.

1186
01:56:50.330 --> 01:57:01.920
Orlando Sequera: Stakeholders are stakeholders, regardless of the approach the 2 are not related you have to identify who they are. Do you have to perform the same type of analysis, regardless of the approach that you follow? So in both

1187
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.849
Orlando Sequera: that is applicable to both.

1188
01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.540
A.

1189
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.300
Orlando Sequera: To both situations

1190
01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:18.950
Orlando Sequera: Do stock holders, or it is.

1191
01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:26.040
Orlando Sequera: are part of stakeholders, not 2 different things. Stockholders means that your own stock that's you purchase talking the

1192
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:27.610
Orlando Sequera: in

1193
01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:34.209
Orlando Sequera: in the market. That's a different thing. So not the that's that's a that's not the same as stakeholder. No.

1194
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:49.530
Orlando Sequera: okay

1195
01:57:50.540 --> 01:58:04.379
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder register is like creative who is Who in your project? In a very simple way. Yes, but it's a list of stakeholder, the shortest, the simplest way to explain it's a list of stakeholders that needs to be validated throughout the entire project Life Cycle.

1196
01:58:06.250 --> 01:58:07.300
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1197
01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:19.359
Orlando Sequera: I'm: looking for more content. Remember to post your content related questions in the Q. A.

1198
01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:20.300
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1199
01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:22.179
Orlando Sequera: A.

1200
01:58:25.170 --> 01:58:34.070
Orlando Sequera: There's another question. Do we need to include stakeholders and grace the chart 2 different things: the racist chart we're gonna get. When we get to a point i'll explain what the racing chart is but

1201
01:58:34.090 --> 01:58:36.600
Orlando Sequera: a 2 different things.

1202
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.869
Orlando Sequera: That's a that's a different artifact.

1203
01:58:47.070 --> 01:58:50.439
Orlando Sequera: What would you do If your stakeholders

1204
01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:51.700
Orlando Sequera: sorry.

1205
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:59.269
Orlando Sequera: What would you do if your stakeholders had conflicting views on an important issue aspects?

1206
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.090
Orlando Sequera: I will

1207
01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:03.679
Orlando Sequera: do my best

1208
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:15.970
Orlando Sequera: in getting them in a conference room if I don't possible, or in a call together and try to give them the chance to explain their views and have my

1209
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:30.330
Orlando Sequera: a team members present to understand their views, especially if they are key stakeholders. I will communicate bottom line. I will communicate with them as soon as possible, and I will try to get that information as quickly as possible.

1210
01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:32.240
Orlando Sequera: so that will be the top of my

1211
01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:36.240
Orlando Sequera: That will be my priority.

1212
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:52.099
Orlando Sequera: Do stakeholders differ in water for agile noise. The same concept applied regardless of the approach. But you need to understand who they are, who who the end users are, who the actual customers are stakeholders are

1213
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:56.979
Orlando Sequera: gonna be stakeholders, regardless of the approach you need to validate that

1214
01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:07.170
Orlando Sequera: that that is applicable regardless of the approach you have to work on understanding who your stakeholders are. You perform this

1215
02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:13.910
Orlando Sequera: a processes regardless of the the development approach that you're going to follow for your project.

1216
02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.280
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be

1217
02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:22.939
Orlando Sequera: I I if if anything, the type of organization right? But

1218
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:25.680
Orlando Sequera: do you have to identify your key stakeholders?

1219
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:29.419
Orlando Sequera: Another question where the key points to identify key stakeholders, for

1220
02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:36.459
Orlando Sequera: we we have been mentioning that you talk to people, you same questioners and service. You ask your team members multiple ways.

1221
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:38.330
Orlando Sequera: multiple ways of doing that.

1222
02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:48.230
Orlando Sequera: What is the sentence model? We answered that already we went over that

1223
02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:53.010
Orlando Sequera: a influence on it to it, a good idea to put out there no

1224
02:00:53.130 --> 02:00:55.349
Orlando Sequera: internal to the team and the Pmo.

1225
02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:58.700
Orlando Sequera: A.

1226
02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:08.869
Orlando Sequera: Can you give a few examples or questions when new to an organization talking to people, find out about stakeholders. They you get a top, do you?

1227
02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:17.970
Orlando Sequera: If your project is to develop a new software for the coming department, talk to the accounting, find out who the key players are, and start asking questions.

1228
02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.429
Orlando Sequera: Leverage the Pmo. If there's a pmo in place. Talk to other project managers.

1229
02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:28.090
Orlando Sequera: but you gotta ask for guidance and help. You have to be proactive. Don't. Wait

1230
02:01:28.150 --> 02:01:37.259
Orlando Sequera: for other people to give it to you. It doesn't work like that. You have to be proactive. You're your own advocate, and you're just tour for your project. That's why you're the project manager.

1231
02:01:43.530 --> 02:01:46.200
Orlando Sequera: All right. I

1232
02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:51.460
Orlando Sequera: answer that question. So

1233
02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:58.110
Orlando Sequera: who is responsible for validating this, they all the registers that after he has been developed, the project manager.

1234
02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:08.539
Another question: do you have an example from NASA? You had a stakeholder

1235
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:16.680
Orlando Sequera: communication challenge that you overcame. Yes, I do. I have multiple.

1236
02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:17.429
Orlando Sequera: But

1237
02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:20.649
Orlando Sequera: again it goes. It goes back to

1238
02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:31.590
Orlando Sequera: analyzing and understanding their requirements. This particular slide that we have here. We need to perform that talk to them, Communicate with them, try to find out what is your preferred way

1239
02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:46.710
Orlando Sequera: of communication, but sometimes they might tell you it is voicemail, it is. Leave me a voicemail if i'm not in my office or send me an email or it, etc., a phone call or a face to face. I would like to have a face to face meeting with you on a weekly basis.

1240
02:02:47.090 --> 02:02:47.910
Orlando Sequera: but

1241
02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:57.989
Orlando Sequera: he might be more than one. I had a really challenging stakeholder, and it turns out that a I sent emails the emails. Never.

1242
02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:06.719
Orlando Sequera: They were never replied. I sent I call and left voice. Mails never got a reply, and

1243
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:12.640
Orlando Sequera: I even went and printed out some documents that left her in her office a.

1244
02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:15.050
Orlando Sequera: I left the documents in there.

1245
02:03:15.610 --> 02:03:28.529
Orlando Sequera: I was ready to send smoke signals, but then I realized that when I asked the question in using a I am at the time W. What were we using? We we were not using teams we were using.

1246
02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:38.350
Orlando Sequera: and I forgot the name of the application. But we were using instant messaging, and I sent her a message to reply right away. So put it this my job

1247
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.080
Orlando Sequera: to decipher

1248
02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:47.060
Orlando Sequera: what works for that stakeholders. It is not the other way around. They don't have to communicate with you. You want to make sure that

1249
02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:56.559
Orlando Sequera: you understand, do you? Do they like work to figure out what works best with that stakeholder. It's your project. So you are the project manager for a reason. Okay.

1250
02:03:57.130 --> 02:03:57.950
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1251
02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.489
Orlando Sequera: So it is a.

1252
02:04:01.190 --> 02:04:07.049
Orlando Sequera: But it's not just sending an email that is not gonna cut it. It's way much more than than that.

1253
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:12.040
Orlando Sequera: Okay, I

1254
02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:18.559
Orlando Sequera: what? Our champions, your sister and neutral. We went over that

1255
02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:31.329
Orlando Sequera: another question: Are the resources for templates to for

1256
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:32.160
to work

1257
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:42.250
Orlando Sequera: our stakeholders not to identify stakeholders? A survey questioners? Yes, I would recommend you from Pmi. Do you have project management.com.

1258
02:04:46.690 --> 02:04:47.420
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1259
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:50.099
Orlando Sequera: I

1260
02:04:57.810 --> 02:05:00.949
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So let's continue with the content.

1261
02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:02.610
Orlando Sequera: And

1262
02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:09.450
Orlando Sequera: so this is important. This is going to help us to address

1263
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:11.740
Orlando Sequera: a multiple

1264
02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:24.899
Orlando Sequera: to perform that intel analysis that we have to to perform for our for our project, and understand what our stakeholder communication needs and best and preferred ways for communication.

1265
02:05:25.670 --> 02:05:26.639
Orlando Sequera: Also.

1266
02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:32.700
Orlando Sequera: some of the communication methods that we use. There are multiple

1267
02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:34.590
Orlando Sequera: ways to communicate. They

1268
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:39.350
Orlando Sequera: the best one, but it's not always possible it's face to face.

1269
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:41.980
Orlando Sequera: But we can. Also.

1270
02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:46.969
Orlando Sequera: We use video conferencing tools like the one that we're using for this class

1271
02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:49.139
Orlando Sequera: phone calls. So that's

1272
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:58.360
Orlando Sequera: that. That's one way. But it's not the only way you can also send emails. You can also use text messaging or send or Eastern messaging.

1273
02:05:58.870 --> 02:06:00.040
Orlando Sequera: Even

1274
02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:01.650
Orlando Sequera: use

1275
02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:09.139
Orlando Sequera: websites and social media. That's also another way to communicate, especially if you, if you want to reach out to a large audience, think of

1276
02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:28.160
Orlando Sequera: your own Internet at your own organization. If you want to send communication to a, it is just a document that you want to send, for example, instructions they manual for your software for the accounting department. You want to share a document and is, do you want to?

1277
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:37.820
Orlando Sequera: You want to do it in the most efficient way? Put it in in sharepoint and sharing that folder with your users. That's one way of communication. So that works really well.

1278
02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:40.220
Orlando Sequera: A. It's not always

1279
02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:55.960
Orlando Sequera: just an email. It's not just the phone call. So multiple ways. We have multiple ways that we can that we can communicate. And of course we have physical ways, like body language, gestures. We gotta pay attention to those queues as well, and when we are in a

1280
02:06:55.970 --> 02:07:10.039
Orlando Sequera: conference room we can use a whiteboard and then start a having a brainstorming session, for example, so multiple ways of communication that you can use that you can have so, but it it.

1281
02:07:10.050 --> 02:07:16.309
Orlando Sequera: Remember, it's not just sending that email. That is not gonna to this one way. But it's not just sending an email.

1282
02:07:16.730 --> 02:07:17.420
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1283
02:07:21.170 --> 02:07:24.120
Orlando Sequera: And this is something important to

1284
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:28.169
Orlando Sequera: remember for the exam. We have

1285
02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.050
Orlando Sequera: basically

1286
02:07:30.230 --> 02:07:36.169
Orlando Sequera: what we call push communication. And then what we call pull communication methods

1287
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:46.340
Orlando Sequera: push very simple to understand. Think of an email right. Would you click on a button and we send an email, or when we make a phone call that's push, pull is

1288
02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:50.259
Orlando Sequera: the best example for pool communication is sharepoint.

1289
02:07:50.530 --> 02:08:06.590
Orlando Sequera: You upload a document when you want to reach out to an actual, to a large number of users, and it's more effective. It is way, much more effective, and to to do it this way, Using the pool communication method.

1290
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:12.599
Orlando Sequera: you post your document in a sharepoint site and share that with your

1291
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:21.019
Orlando Sequera: with with your users, with your stakeholders, etc. Right? So that's what we call pool. So pull communication, Think of sharepoint, push

1292
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:36.859
Orlando Sequera: email or making a phone call. And of course we have conversations. This can be face to face, or this is interactive. It can be face to face or virtual, and that is a type of communication method, interactive right?

1293
02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:39.730
Orlando Sequera: And of course, for agile teams

1294
02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:59.459
Orlando Sequera: you do not have to be collocated all the time by co-located, I mean within the same physical space 6 feet from each other. No, you can be in different your graphic locations and still be agile. The goal is to be able to collaborate, have the means to be able to collaborate using a

1295
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:03.020
Orlando Sequera: technology that we have available nowadays. Okay.

1296
02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:07.100
Orlando Sequera: But push, send in the email pull sharepoint.

1297
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:08.199
Orlando Sequera: Think of that.

1298
02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:17.650
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1299
02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:21.199
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to communication.

1300
02:09:21.630 --> 02:09:30.879
Orlando Sequera: we are gonna have some challenges. And there's some aspects that we have to keep in mind that might serve even as

1301
02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:36.940
Orlando Sequera: in some cases they may be some, some constraints that we have to take into account.

1302
02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:38.960
Orlando Sequera: We have to consider

1303
02:09:39.490 --> 02:09:42.449
Orlando Sequera: the method for that's why we performed

1304
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:43.510
Orlando Sequera: that

1305
02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:47.140
Orlando Sequera: communication, requirement, analysis with our stakeholders.

1306
02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.119
Orlando Sequera: and then we have to.

1307
02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:52.899
Orlando Sequera: This is where both the older engagement and communication

1308
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:56.299
Orlando Sequera: pretty much come together, if if you will

1309
02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.250
Orlando Sequera: in a way that we have to take into account these factors

1310
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.540
Orlando Sequera: the urgency.

1311
02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:06.770
Orlando Sequera: How quickly do I need to send this information? Where do I have to provide it

1312
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:13.010
Orlando Sequera: the availability and the reliability of technology. Does everybody have access

1313
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:29.360
Orlando Sequera: to this technology? Do we all have Microsoft teams? Do we all have zoom? Is it allowed? By the by, by, the organization, etc. So we gotta make sure that we know that the ease of use, the project environment.

1314
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:44.279
Orlando Sequera: the language, remember, as we mentioned before, we might be working with teams that are global teams that are actually in different geographic locations, so that language and formality of the organization, the information. I'm sorry, then.

1315
02:10:44.290 --> 02:11:00.859
Orlando Sequera: Sensitivity and covering confidentiality of information for those of you that have worked with the Government different government levels doesn't have to be the Federal government. Only here in the Us. Multiple levels of government or any of your countries, European countries. It's the same principle, right.

1316
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:07.459
Orlando Sequera: There are some principles and sensitivity and confidentiality that you have to apply for some information. It

1317
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:15.200
Orlando Sequera: here. The Us. Working with the Federal Government we used to call a I never work with a classified information.

1318
02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:18.750
Orlando Sequera: I worked with a sensitive, but on classified.

1319
02:11:18.850 --> 02:11:22.520
Orlando Sequera: That was the old classification now is called Kui.

1320
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:24.779
Orlando Sequera: and basically

1321
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:42.809
Orlando Sequera: you have to make sure that you take that into account. A. When you're sharing information you have to validate the audience multiple aspects, and who needs to receive that information. Those of you that have a that coming from the military know exactly what I'm. What i'm referring to we need to.

1322
02:11:42.930 --> 02:12:01.620
Orlando Sequera: This is another another re information why we have to review our opa. There might be some guidelines. There might be some policies that we have to follow when it comes to posting content to social media. For example, this is pretty cool. This can be a make or break even

1323
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:10.539
Orlando Sequera: someone. Some people can be removed from their they from their jobs by violating these communication Protocols communication. Opa.

1324
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:15.360
Orlando Sequera: I remember that someone at some point in time there was.

1325
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:19.710
Orlando Sequera: There was a problem. There was an accident with a Spacex

1326
02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:21.940
Orlando Sequera: rocket lunch, and

1327
02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.950
Orlando Sequera: the incident was filmed, and

1328
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:34.400
Orlando Sequera: they was posted in social media, and they found out who it was, and the person was working for Spacex, and I think that was a cost for termination. So we have to

1329
02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:46.170
Orlando Sequera: make sure that we know those communication protocols a and any data Protection law regulation, for example. Gdpr. Papa, Anything that is applicable to our.

1330
02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:56.760
Orlando Sequera: to our, to that type of project. We gotta make sure that we take that into account and any accessibility requirements, multiple angles that we have to look at when it comes to communication.

1331
02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:58.940
Orlando Sequera: Okay, multiple aspects

1332
02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:04.839
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to communication. Another

1333
02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:10.659
Orlando Sequera: aspect that we have to take into account. This is the basic communication model.

1334
02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:14.019
Orlando Sequera: and here we have

1335
02:13:14.770 --> 02:13:17.749
Orlando Sequera: mainly a sender and a receiver.

1336
02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.460
Orlando Sequera: and we, the sender, is

1337
02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:22.800
Orlando Sequera: transmitting a message.

1338
02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:25.380
Orlando Sequera: The receiver is

1339
02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:31.850
Orlando Sequera: acknowledging the message and providing feedback to the sender

1340
02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.339
Orlando Sequera: through a medium.

1341
02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:35.510
Orlando Sequera: Okay, but

1342
02:13:35.890 --> 02:13:40.050
Orlando Sequera: is not that simple? There is something that is highlighted here.

1343
02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:46.460
Orlando Sequera: which is noise. And think of what's happening right now with all of us in the class

1344
02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:48.090
Orlando Sequera: we have.

1345
02:13:48.190 --> 02:13:55.590
Orlando Sequera: i'm sending information for you to successfully pass your Pmp. Exam. And also promoting best practices for project management.

1346
02:13:55.770 --> 02:14:00.520
Orlando Sequera: And you are the receivers. You are acknowledging the message and providing feedback through

1347
02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.550
Orlando Sequera: the

1348
02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:06.639
Orlando Sequera: resources that we have available. We have the chat, and we have the Q. A.

1349
02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:07.559
Orlando Sequera: But

1350
02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:14.119
Orlando Sequera: fortunately we have had some noise, especially with the chat that we're trying to keep under control

1351
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:32.019
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that is the the communication process happens, and you are able to receive the information as intended, and it is beneficial for your preparation for the Pmp. Exam: so noise is going to happen. This is just an example, and we got to take into account multiple

1352
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:35.880
Orlando Sequera: multiple aspects. They're highlighted here, some of them.

1353
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:40.179
Orlando Sequera: It's about the culture. Remember the chances are that you're gonna be working with

1354
02:14:41.310 --> 02:14:44.380
Orlando Sequera: a teams that are diverse

1355
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:50.330
Orlando Sequera: their people from different cultures get to take that into account. Different genders, different professions.

1356
02:14:50.460 --> 02:15:05.939
Orlando Sequera: And we all have biases and having a bias, is it's okay. It's part of human nature, right? The problem comes with those a systems that's a different story. But we have to take into account that biases you have to be able to overcome that, and then

1357
02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:25.220
Orlando Sequera: it so it and it happens on both ends. It happens with the receivers, and it happens with the centers, so we have to try to find that happy medium which is what we're trying to do with this class. So the communication actually happens. Okay. So we all we all have to a contribute, so that can happen

1358
02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:27.040
all right

1359
02:15:29.530 --> 02:15:32.899
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to engaging our stakeholders.

1360
02:15:34.570 --> 02:15:35.809
Orlando Sequera: It really.

1361
02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:38.690
Orlando Sequera: once we have the plans in place.

1362
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:41.690
Orlando Sequera: we have to execute on the strategy, right.

1363
02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:45.480
Orlando Sequera: and it's about making sure that they are involved.

1364
02:15:46.080 --> 02:16:03.419
Orlando Sequera: Your stakeholders are involved, based on their needs, based on their expectations based on their interests and based on the potential impact they can have on the project. We gotta get them involved. Some of them need to be more involved than others. Remember, they have their daily duties. They are not

1365
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:07.479
Orlando Sequera: going to be available. 24, 7 for you. They have work. They

1366
02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:24.740
Orlando Sequera: probably have multiple people multiple projects. I'm: sorry. And they are working in multiple endeavors and plus operations, and their basic people usually just take a key stakeholders or basic people. They're a your sponsors, your your

1367
02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:37.320
Orlando Sequera: your key stakeholders for your project. They're usually basic people. So, but you need to get them involved and get that commitment from them. That's why it's so important to build that relationship with them and build that trust and that trust.

1368
02:16:37.469 --> 02:16:39.070
Orlando Sequera: Use those.

1369
02:16:39.469 --> 02:16:42.059
Orlando Sequera: And you also need to be a

1370
02:16:42.219 --> 02:16:45.239
Orlando Sequera: strategic when it comes to using the right

1371
02:16:45.430 --> 02:17:04.850
Orlando Sequera: management strategies. But remember, you're not managing your stakeholders. You're managing their expectations. You're managing the communication. Your management. You're managing their engagement. You're not managing them as an individual. You're managing their expectations. You're managing their involvement. That's what you're managing

1372
02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:08.390
Orlando Sequera: for them. And again as I've been mentioning before

1373
02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:27.679
Orlando Sequera: it boils down to build, trust. It boils down to keep those relationships. It is important you're in the business of building relationships during the business of networking. You're in the business of earning trust and building trust with other individuals. That's a key aspect of Project management.

1374
02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.240
Orlando Sequera: One

1375
02:17:31.290 --> 02:17:34.089
Orlando Sequera: example

1376
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:47.960
Orlando Sequera: of a stakeholder engagement access to matrix the with that it's also known as seam is what we have here. Once you have your stakeholders identified in your stakeholder register.

1377
02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:49.860
Orlando Sequera: you should

1378
02:17:50.370 --> 02:17:53.299
Orlando Sequera: work and understanding, Are they?

1379
02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:58.830
Orlando Sequera: I did? Are they resistant? Are they resistors to your project, or they were system to your project?

1380
02:17:58.969 --> 02:18:10.300
Orlando Sequera: Are they neutral? In some cases you might have some of them there. Don't even know about your project. They're unaware. Are they supportive, or the are they leading? Okay, so you should try to

1381
02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:18.230
Orlando Sequera: a perform this analysis, to understand, and the goal here is to understand present state.

1382
02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:24.700
Orlando Sequera: and then future state or desire engagement. Let's start somewhere

1383
02:18:24.809 --> 02:18:33.270
Orlando Sequera: on day, one after you perform your stakeholder identification. This is where they are, all your stakeholders, and

1384
02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:38.299
Orlando Sequera: you also going to identify. This is where I meet them. So

1385
02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:42.010
Orlando Sequera: this is future state, or this is combining the 2.

1386
02:18:42.129 --> 02:18:43.870
Orlando Sequera: This is where they are

1387
02:18:44.889 --> 02:19:00.820
Orlando Sequera: right now current. They're leading, but we need them to be supportive. So that's fine. Either they they can. They. They're right now leading, but they we need them to be supportive. We don't want that to fall to resistant or unaware. If we have

1388
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:04.930
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder. Number 2 right now is supportive.

1389
02:19:05.219 --> 02:19:18.090
Orlando Sequera: but the disarming engagement level is leading. We need them to be a little bit more active. But anyone notice something that in the desire engagement level we do not want to have anyone. As for assistant.

1390
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:22.720
Orlando Sequera: that's why I was recommending you to identify who those stakeholders are.

1391
02:19:23.250 --> 02:19:34.709
Orlando Sequera: I will start working with them, understanding. Why are you against the project? What are your Why are you not? What is your

1392
02:19:35.059 --> 02:19:46.359
Orlando Sequera: Please share with me as the Pm. Why are your resistance to point? They might have some valid points, and you definitely want to a understand that as quick

1393
02:19:47.059 --> 02:19:48.009
Orlando Sequera: you need to.

1394
02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:58.809
Orlando Sequera: At least we need to move them to at least neutral, if not supportive. But you shouldn't have any stakeholders as resistant. This is an accident waiting to happen

1395
02:19:58.830 --> 02:20:06.399
Orlando Sequera: for your project. Remember your but it's about building relationships. It's about building process of a building work

1396
02:20:07.050 --> 02:20:07.970
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1397
02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:13.059
Orlando Sequera: I see that some of you are

1398
02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:15.160
Orlando Sequera: posting questions.

1399
02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:22.120
Orlando Sequera: Contempor related questions go in the chat, not in the I'm. Sorry. Go in the Q. A. Not in the Chat contem related questions

1400
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.800
Orlando Sequera: go in the Q. And a.

1401
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:26.180
Orlando Sequera: And vote on those questions. Okay.

1402
02:20:31.470 --> 02:20:36.720
Orlando Sequera: And we have been. This is what we have covered so far

1403
02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:38.619
Orlando Sequera: related to

1404
02:20:39.010 --> 02:20:43.040
Orlando Sequera: the exam Content Outline is about collaboration with our stakeholders.

1405
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:53.939
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand their engagement needs for our stakeholders, and we need to know who they are, we need to keep them engaged when we perform this intel about your

1406
02:20:56.160 --> 02:21:10.269
Orlando Sequera: about the stakeholders where the communication needs, and what are the level of power the level of interest. We can start prioritizing our stakeholders. We have to categorize our stakeholders, our day supporters of the resistors. Are they a

1407
02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:29.290
Orlando Sequera: Are they neutral. Are they on aware we have to perform that, and then come up with their best strategy possible to keep them engaged. That is crucial for your project, and this is tied up to communications. We need to understand their communication needs and also use

1408
02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:33.060
Orlando Sequera: the plethora of communication methods that we have available

1409
02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:42.940
Orlando Sequera: based on their needs and based on the stakeholders requirements. Okay, communication is the vehicle that is going to allow us to engage our stakeholders.

1410
02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:47.169
Orlando Sequera: That's pretty much a summary of what we have covered so far.

1411
02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:51.920
Orlando Sequera: and that's gonna take us to

1412
02:21:52.430 --> 02:22:08.029
Orlando Sequera: our next topic, which is topic be forming the team. I would like to take a look at some of the questions, and remember Content, Related questions are going to be in your Q. A. Not in the chat, in your Q. A.

1413
02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:12.730
Orlando Sequera: In your Q. A.

1414
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:15.790
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Going to root

1415
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:17.860
Orlando Sequera: just to re the chat.

1416
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1417
02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:27.020
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna review the Q. A. For content related questions.

1418
02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:42.139
Orlando Sequera: If the best communication is face to face. Should you be always following up with a written summary many minutes to ensure people

1419
02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:44.740
Orlando Sequera: have something to go back and review

1420
02:22:45.130 --> 02:22:47.880
Orlando Sequera: that way you do not have.

1421
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:50.220
Orlando Sequera: 2 weeks ago you said moment.

1422
02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:52.729
Orlando Sequera: That's a question in the Q. And a.

1423
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:54.859
Orlando Sequera: The answer is

1424
02:22:55.390 --> 02:23:05.140
Orlando Sequera: the best. The best communication way is face to face. That is true, but it's not always possible. But remember, you have to perform the analysis of your stakeholders

1425
02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:25.200
Orlando Sequera: communication requirements to understand which ones are the most efficient communication methods with your stakeholders. They're always gonna be a meeting. They might not be. You might not have them available for a meeting face to face. So you have to understand what works for them. You don't they don't have to adjust to you. You adjust to them. That's the point

1426
02:23:25.210 --> 02:23:31.650
Orlando Sequera: the important point that I'm trying to that I'm trying to make and based on, based on that, you

1427
02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:36.660
Orlando Sequera: develop your strategy. Okay. But you should use

1428
02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.150
Orlando Sequera: multiple communication methods.

1429
02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:52.899
Orlando Sequera: There's another question: Why use numbers and not names in this and the same you can use either or on ultimately.

1430
02:23:52.960 --> 02:24:00.069
Orlando Sequera: what is trying to take away the the bias. That's that's the reason why. But you can use either or in the same.

1431
02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:02.830
Orlando Sequera: That's another question in the Q. A.

1432
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:15.080
Orlando Sequera: Why? On the communication requirements. Analysis. There is a predictive icon. It's only applicable to predictive.

1433
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:21.230
Orlando Sequera: It's a. It's going to be applicable to both. It's applicable to adaptive as well to agile.

1434
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:25.099
Orlando Sequera: you have to communicate, regardless of the approach.

1435
02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:38.970
Orlando Sequera: Are there any platforms that are off limits on professional? That we should be aware of? That is a question to your organization

1436
02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:40.130
Orlando Sequera: that's a

1437
02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:42.860
Orlando Sequera: in some organizations. Zoom is not allowed.

1438
02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:46.420
Orlando Sequera: So that's a question for your particular organization

1439
02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:56.659
Orlando Sequera: question. Have I used the same. Yes, always. That's super important. You need to know who they

1440
02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:05.630
Orlando Sequera: where the stakeholders fall. That's really important into work that you have to perform. You need to understand who the resistors are and work with them.

1441
02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.920
Orlando Sequera: It's another question in reference to the metric: what does leading mean

1442
02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:27.610
Orlando Sequera: in leading driving the project drive very active driving the project. You want your sponsor to be leading right? So, driving the scope, driving the direction of the project. That's what we mean by leading

1443
02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:30.549
Orlando Sequera: another question

1444
02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:42.929
Orlando Sequera: in my example of stakeholder register, what is major requirements? Well may your requirements about it's usually tied up to key stakeholder major requirements about scope. My, I want my prior to be deliver on time within budget.

1445
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:49.830
Orlando Sequera: covering all the scope that was agreed upon. So those are. That's what we mean by major requirements about the project

1446
02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:01.979
Orlando Sequera: based on the example which is the example of power interest based on the definition. Where we went over the

1447
02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:06.829
Orlando Sequera: you can replace him influence by interest, and it's the same approach.

1448
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:13.370
Orlando Sequera: It's the sameiest model, particularly tied to adaptive hybrid approaches. Nope.

1449
02:26:14.460 --> 02:26:17.489
Orlando Sequera: It works regardless of the approach.

1450
02:26:22.470 --> 02:26:30.339
Orlando Sequera: Another question is, what happens if the stakeholder interest is low and low power, but they tame to scope, creep. The project.

1451
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:39.919
Orlando Sequera: Well, we're we're mixing a couple of things one that shouldn't happen. If it's low power, low interest, they shouldn't be any we that's why we need to validate.

1452
02:26:40.650 --> 02:26:48.460
Orlando Sequera: We need to validate the stakeholders. That's ultimately what we're doing with this Intel, and if they try to add scope.

1453
02:26:49.780 --> 02:27:00.100
Orlando Sequera: we should lever. That's what we leverage our sponsor that we keep that under control, so that we need to to. That's where that legitimacy

1454
02:27:00.390 --> 02:27:06.200
Orlando Sequera: dimension of stakeholders come into play. We need to know the play key players are, and who the decision makers are.

1455
02:27:06.270 --> 02:27:09.000
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's why we perform this analysis

1456
02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:11.859
Orlando Sequera: to validate our stakeholders.

1457
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:25.900
Orlando Sequera: Would a resistor be prior to prioritize higher? Well, no, I will prioritize higher a key stakeholder, high power, high interest, high influence.

1458
02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:36.530
Orlando Sequera: But I will start you. You're kind of mixing a couple of things. I will start with addressing the concerns of our resistor. Once I use the same model, for example.

1459
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:37.580
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1460
02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:41.369
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat.

1461
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:47.769
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Sorry in the Q. A. I'm. Reading the questions from the Q. A.

1462
02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:51.760
Orlando Sequera: We'll hire

1463
02:27:52.190 --> 02:28:00.079
Orlando Sequera: authority. CEO Program Manager, direct Project manager to at key stakeholders. Such a. Government Congress. I don't really

1464
02:28:01.470 --> 02:28:03.670
Orlando Sequera: will hire authorities

1465
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:06.860
Orlando Sequera: direct project manager to add key stakeholders.

1466
02:28:06.890 --> 02:28:07.750
Orlando Sequera: No.

1467
02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:09.130
Orlando Sequera: Nope.

1468
02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:19.999
Orlando Sequera: you are this tour of your project that usually doesn't happen is they they have a lot going on on their plate to be telling you what to do. Do You are the project manager, for a reason? Sure answer is no.

1469
02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:38.200
Orlando Sequera: It seems like stakeholder analysis, a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix are very similar and a little bit repetitive. It is crucial. Why have both? Because it is a crucial area of your project.

1470
02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:41.039
Orlando Sequera: it can make or break your project.

1471
02:28:44.310 --> 02:28:46.190
Orlando Sequera: Another questions.

1472
02:28:46.560 --> 02:29:03.010
Orlando Sequera: Could you give us some additional examples of the Tractors any? The thing is that is very specific to each project you. It's any individual, a group of individuals that are against your project that are not supporting your project in the example of the accounting software. It could be

1473
02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:22.089
Orlando Sequera: the end users. They might be resistors. They might. They might feel that their current software is working well. They're used to it. They have work with it for 20 years, and they don't want to change it so they can be resistors, so that that's a that I. It changes. It depends on the project. It's very specific. To each project.

1474
02:29:22.130 --> 02:29:23.789
Orlando Sequera: Each situation is different.

1475
02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:30.930
Orlando Sequera: Okay? And

1476
02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:46.820
Orlando Sequera: why do we do another question in the Q. And a: what do we do in a situation

1477
02:29:46.890 --> 02:29:55.419
Orlando Sequera: where the stakeholders have a conflict of interest? We need to understand that's why we need to understand really well who they are, and communicate with them

1478
02:29:55.450 --> 02:29:58.710
Orlando Sequera: and validate their concerns. Get

1479
02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:10.989
Orlando Sequera: and leverage your sponsor. Always leverage a sponsor, so it's about communication, understanding their positions, validate their needs and try to get people on the same page. That's part of your job as a project manager.

1480
02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:16.880
Orlando Sequera: No question. W. W. Could you share a real project management plan.

1481
02:30:17.130 --> 02:30:24.859
Orlando Sequera: Can we all have all the spreadsheet, at least to document? We're going to be going over the different topics, and we're going to be talking about different components.

1482
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:29.249
Orlando Sequera: It it's we're gonna be doing that throughout the class. Basically.

1483
02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:32.550
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

1484
02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:51.210
Orlando Sequera: Will the Pmo office have a list of prefer communication for typical stakeholders. Normally, that's not the case. This is something specific that changes from project to project. You should do that. You shouldn't rely on what other people did. I wouldn't rely on what other people did in the past for that. I wanna

1485
02:30:51.480 --> 02:31:01.810
Orlando Sequera: Because and why is that? Because stakeholders change? It might not be the same stakeholders. Okay, so I will do that on my I wouldn't rely on what this is something that you have to do with your team.

1486
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:03.579
Orlando Sequera: So sure Answer. Is No

1487
02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:07.449
Orlando Sequera: A.

1488
02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:09.109
Orlando Sequera: Can I group

1489
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:13.760
Orlando Sequera: lower power, high interest? Another question in the chat.

1490
02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:16.140
Orlando Sequera: Can

1491
02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:22.620
Orlando Sequera: a group lower power, high interest stakeholders be collectively consider of high-powered. You can group them in some cases

1492
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:23.720
Orlando Sequera: that

1493
02:31:24.470 --> 02:31:25.910
Orlando Sequera: that is possible.

1494
02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:42.950
Orlando Sequera: But i'll be I'll be careful with that I will be careful. Remember, i'm not saying that low power, low interest are not important. I make sure that I highlighted that. But yes, you can group it's it's also. You can group users and maybe combine. They

1495
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:47.570
Orlando Sequera: change the classification. So yes, it is possible. Sure answer is yes.

1496
02:31:51.790 --> 02:31:59.229
Orlando Sequera: If a proscope is changed due to a known factor we have. We're not covering scope, so we'll. I'll address that when we get to scope

1497
02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:02.350
Orlando Sequera: what is meant by score creep. I'll address that when we get to scope.

1498
02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:15.730
Orlando Sequera: If there are teams or stakeholders, then is it enough to add the team? If there are teams that are stakeholders, then is it enough to add the team name

1499
02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:19.830
Orlando Sequera: as a stakeholder instead of adding names team members in global.

1500
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:21.909
Orlando Sequera: I will add them individually

1501
02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:35.629
Orlando Sequera: that's the team. The project manager developed these alone. You lead this effort, but you can rely on the team and you get help from the team.

1502
02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:39.170
Orlando Sequera: You can get hope from the Pmo. You can get help from the sponsor

1503
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:40.410
Orlando Sequera: you get help.

1504
02:32:40.450 --> 02:32:45.060
Orlando Sequera: What is your responsibility to make sure that this is done?

1505
02:32:47.050 --> 02:32:48.400
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1506
02:32:55.690 --> 02:32:57.050
Orlando Sequera: A

1507
02:32:57.690 --> 02:33:04.490
Orlando Sequera: another question about communication methods push pool by posting that they may pushing. Nope, you are. You are

1508
02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:09.000
Orlando Sequera: publishing the document in a sharepoint site, and people are pulling the document

1509
02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:11.540
Orlando Sequera: from the sharepoint side. That's why they call it pool.

1510
02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:27.640
Orlando Sequera: Another question, if it's If a stakeholder is difficult to reach out, how can we address this challenge? It's up to you. That's why you're the Pm. Figure out what communication method works for that.

1511
02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:29.990
Orlando Sequera: A stakeholder is your job?

1512
02:33:30.380 --> 02:33:31.590
Orlando Sequera: That is your job?

1513
02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:43.369
Orlando Sequera: Another question. Can you explain more? Why would you move someone from leading to supportive

1514
02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:59.350
Orlando Sequera: it's not necessarily about their role. It's about their posture towards the project, and in some cases you might need them just to be supportive, to be there when you need them. Not necessarily leading the project.

1515
02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:02.150
Orlando Sequera: It's not about overstepping.

1516
02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:04.690
Yeah.

1517
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.780
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1518
02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:10.470
Orlando Sequera: Let's continue with the content

1519
02:34:12.370 --> 02:34:15.959
Orlando Sequera: forming the team. This is the next topic. Here

1520
02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:25.609
Orlando Sequera: we are going to work with the team. We're going to build those behaviors that are

1521
02:34:27.210 --> 02:34:29.700
Orlando Sequera: a that are going to allow us

1522
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:32.440
Orlando Sequera: to work as a cohesive unit.

1523
02:34:32.820 --> 02:34:35.949
Orlando Sequera: and I have to figure out what

1524
02:34:36.250 --> 02:34:39.470
Orlando Sequera: they, what skill set do we need to do the work.

1525
02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:40.550
Orlando Sequera: and

1526
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:43.019
Orlando Sequera: how can we.

1527
02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:50.700
Orlando Sequera: How can we progress a. Do our best to make sure that we are that we are able to

1528
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:57.269
Orlando Sequera: complete, to do the work that we have to do with our with our with our project.

1529
02:34:58.110 --> 02:34:59.570
Orlando Sequera: These changes

1530
02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:03.259
Orlando Sequera: forming the team changes if we are following.

1531
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:09.570
Orlando Sequera: If we are following a predictive approach or waterfall. We need to understand the requirements First.

1532
02:35:09.770 --> 02:35:13.129
Orlando Sequera: after we understand the requirements, the scope of the project.

1533
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:15.640
Orlando Sequera: Then we work in

1534
02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:17.460
Orlando Sequera: resource management.

1535
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:31.830
Orlando Sequera: and that's what's gonna help us to understand the different resources that we need not only people, but also equipment the equipment materials and supplies to complete the project. Okay, that's how it's done in predictive. But for

1536
02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:46.799
Orlando Sequera: for adaptive, if we're following an that approach it's a little bit different. We put the team together initially, and then we work on supporting the project requirements because the scope is changing. If we're following an adaptive approach.

1537
02:35:46.890 --> 02:35:49.659
Orlando Sequera: the scope is fixed. If we're following

1538
02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:53.070
Orlando Sequera: predictive approach, so the key aspect

1539
02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:54.940
Orlando Sequera: to this is

1540
02:35:55.620 --> 02:36:13.729
Orlando Sequera: the type of scope that we're working with, and the approach that we're following, but nonetheless we should. It. It's all about building those team agreements, how we're gonna work as a team, If for our project, and how are we going to interact with each other as a project, and we should

1541
02:36:13.850 --> 02:36:16.840
Orlando Sequera: be able to develop a resource management plan.

1542
02:36:17.170 --> 02:36:25.119
Orlando Sequera: That is how it works in predictive. But in agile teams are assembled initially, and they are going

1543
02:36:25.330 --> 02:36:28.299
Orlando Sequera: to be self organized units

1544
02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:29.789
Orlando Sequera: that support

1545
02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:36.539
Orlando Sequera: project requirements for changes. The scope is going to be changes. So that's the difference between the 2 and how we form the teams.

1546
02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:42.639
Orlando Sequera: Now, we're going to watch a video on

1547
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:49.360
Orlando Sequera: the Tuckman ladder of team development. This is this was developed by Bruce Tuckman

1548
02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:57.650
Orlando Sequera: back in the sixties in 1,965, and it shows the different stages of the information.

1549
02:37:00.130 --> 02:37:03.770
Orlando Sequera: And I just want to make sure. That. Okay. Here we go.

1550
02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:15.049
go through 5 stages

1551
02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:18.940
and

1552
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:26.979
back in 1,965. A psychologist named Bruce Tukman observed that teams go through 5 stages

1553
02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:31.539
forming, storming, norming, performing, and a journey.

1554
02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:37.200
Tukman didn't just have a knack for rhyme, although that does make his model easier to remember

1555
02:37:37.410 --> 02:37:43.789
understanding and supporting the team through each phase can be vital to helping it become a high functioning team.

1556
02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:57.290
Initially, the team is introduced. Everyone is polite, pleasant, even eager. This is the forming stage when most team members are excited to start something new and get to know the others.

1557
02:37:57.670 --> 02:38:13.530
Then, of course, reality sets in during the storming phase. The weight of the task at hand sinks in the initial excitement, and the need to be polite. We're off soon enough. People start to notice and appreciate each other's strengths.

1558
02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:31.809
This is the norming stage. When the group starts to settle into a groove, everyone is contributing and working as a cohesive unit. Eventually the new team's members are confident and familiar enough with the project and their team that they can operate without supervision. This is the performing stage

1559
02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:37.899
when everyone on the team is on the same page, and driving full speed ahead toward the final goal.

1560
02:38:38.610 --> 02:38:45.519
In 1,977. Tukman added a fifth state, a journey sadly, not a perfect ride.

1561
02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:53.809
This phase is sometimes known as mourning, because the team members have grown close and feel a loss now that the experience is over.

1562
02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:57.609
the point of having a team is to work together.

1563
02:38:57.710 --> 02:39:07.349
understanding how teams develop and supporting that development is key to helping your team mature into the high performing team. It should be

1564
02:39:08.850 --> 02:39:14.899
Orlando Sequera: all right. So the talkman ladder. This is the first exposure. This is what happens. Any team goes through this

1565
02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.199
Orlando Sequera: forming.

1566
02:39:16.570 --> 02:39:17.960
Orlando Sequera: storming Norman

1567
02:39:18.130 --> 02:39:19.220
Orlando Sequera: performing.

1568
02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:27.829
Orlando Sequera: and a journey adjourn, because projects come to an end. That's why they added that last stage we're going to cover this again in more detail when we get to

1569
02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:30.100
Orlando Sequera: a lesson 4. But

1570
02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:34.949
Orlando Sequera: it was shown here because this happens when we initially form a team

1571
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:41.110
Orlando Sequera: a few aspects to keep in mind. These are 2 important concepts.

1572
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:44.210
Orlando Sequera: teams. Remember.

1573
02:39:44.250 --> 02:39:46.580
Orlando Sequera: I mentioned that briefly yesterday.

1574
02:39:47.350 --> 02:39:53.329
Orlando Sequera: A project team is cross function, meaning that you have people that are gonna be that have different skill set

1575
02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:58.970
Orlando Sequera: to perform the work that we need to complete in our project. That's this cope with the project. Okay

1576
02:39:59.010 --> 02:40:03.820
Orlando Sequera: and ideally it should be as self organized as possible.

1577
02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:12.280
Orlando Sequera: If we're, following an adaptive approach and agile approach. This is a no-brainer. Agile teams are self-organized, and self manage.

1578
02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:14.589
Orlando Sequera: But even in predictive.

1579
02:40:14.660 --> 02:40:22.400
Orlando Sequera: the trend nowadays is to let teams to be as self-organized as possible and we are

1580
02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:26.769
Orlando Sequera: transitioning nowadays to a different type of leadership

1581
02:40:27.270 --> 02:40:31.580
Orlando Sequera: which is a servant type of leadership, serve and leadership.

1582
02:40:31.650 --> 02:40:49.140
Orlando Sequera: We basically as project managers. We are stewards of the team. This is not command and control. We're not telling the team what to do. We are catering to the team. We're serving the team. We're making sure that they have the tools that they need the equipment that they need to do the work, and we are

1583
02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:52.709
Orlando Sequera: protecting them. We're shielding the team in.

1584
02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:56.370
Orlando Sequera: We're basically helping them. We're servants

1585
02:40:56.470 --> 02:41:00.489
Orlando Sequera: service leaders to that team. That's what that's a key concept.

1586
02:41:00.690 --> 02:41:08.349
Orlando Sequera: That is a must we? You need to know? Do you need to master that concept for the Pmp. Exam. By the way.

1587
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:13.629
Orlando Sequera: I will even recommend you to look at every question

1588
02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:40.269
Orlando Sequera: that you answer in your Pmp. Exam. From the perspective of a servant leader. It's not command and control. We're not directing. We're not telling them what to do, and I know that for those of you that are coming from the military. This is a major cultural shock, but that is important to understand. We and and he goes back to something that we mentioned out. 30 chances are that we are not. We're not. We're not going to have the level of power, the level of a 30. We have to use the leadership.

1589
02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:49.800
Orlando Sequera: and this is a type of leadership that we have to use several leadership which i'm. Sure you you are familiar with for those of you that are coming from the military servant leaders.

1590
02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:58.739
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so look at it. From that perspective we help the team we cater to the team. We make sure that they have everything that they need

1591
02:41:58.810 --> 02:42:00.730
Orlando Sequera: in order to do their work.

1592
02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:01.659
Orlando Sequera: All right

1593
02:42:02.810 --> 02:42:03.789
Orlando Sequera: Also

1594
02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:07.290
Orlando Sequera: A. When it comes to the

1595
02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:11.890
Orlando Sequera: A project manager role in adaptive teams.

1596
02:42:11.930 --> 02:42:13.240
Orlando Sequera: agile teams.

1597
02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:21.430
Orlando Sequera: It is, it seems to be a centralized. We usually have the role of a team lead.

1598
02:42:21.700 --> 02:42:25.980
Orlando Sequera: Right? It's. It's really close to in scrum to the scrum master.

1599
02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:45.520
Orlando Sequera: If it's centralized, they have a team lead or someone in a similar role, like a scrum master is the closest in scrum. They'll be the closest role to a the traditional project manager that we know. But it's about a we have one, the signature individual that is gonna practice all the leadership activities, but it could also be

1600
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:47.529
Orlando Sequera: a done in a different way.

1601
02:42:47.930 --> 02:42:50.330
Orlando Sequera: It could be distributed in which

1602
02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:51.210
Orlando Sequera: they.

1603
02:42:51.870 --> 02:43:08.689
Orlando Sequera: the actual responsibilities as a facilitator communication, enabler collaboration. They shift from team, member to team member. That also happens. Okay. But I will venture to say that in most cases is centralized rather than distributed. But it also happens

1604
02:43:09.130 --> 02:43:10.349
Orlando Sequera: it is possible

1605
02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:13.779
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1606
02:43:15.010 --> 02:43:16.410
Orlando Sequera: a hybrid.

1607
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:19.510
Orlando Sequera: the information is usually done

1608
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:21.869
Orlando Sequera: following a centralized approach

1609
02:43:22.650 --> 02:43:33.890
Orlando Sequera: by a project manager team lead, and then a self-organized product team for portions of the work. So this is a combination. We have a centralized coordination for certain areas of the work.

1610
02:43:34.170 --> 02:43:35.990
Orlando Sequera: but we also have

1611
02:43:36.050 --> 02:43:40.720
Orlando Sequera: some areas like development, for example, that can be done in a more

1612
02:43:40.820 --> 02:43:49.769
Orlando Sequera: agile or adaptive way. But this centralized computation is more a aligned with predictive. So that is the combination we can.

1613
02:43:49.810 --> 02:43:53.709
Orlando Sequera: We can follow that that happens. That happens a lot

1614
02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:58.659
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the composition of the team.

1615
02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:02.830
Orlando Sequera: These changes from project to project for you.

1616
02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:17.610
Orlando Sequera: Every single product is different. It changes from from product to project, and this is pretty much referring to how the team members are going to be assembled. Do we need full time team members that we need part time team members a.

1617
02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:33.960
Orlando Sequera: It changes based on organization and influences like resource availability. For example, that's why it's so important to understand your ecosystem, your environment, your organization. And here we can include some people with specialized knowledge or some people with

1618
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:39.199
Orlando Sequera: a more of a generalized knowledge.

1619
02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:43.160
Orlando Sequera: The roles in the project team

1620
02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:46.809
Orlando Sequera: we have multiple roles. We have

1621
02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:49.360
Orlando Sequera: the project management staff.

1622
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:53.549
Orlando Sequera: These are the people that are going to be performing activities like so

1623
02:44:54.020 --> 02:45:07.119
Orlando Sequera: pulling your schedulers, your butt budgeting activities. It can be you as the Pm. Or someone else. They're gonna be working with race manager and tasks and project communications. That is what we mean by project management

1624
02:45:07.250 --> 02:45:15.260
Orlando Sequera: a staff. In some cases this can be supported by the Pmo. If you have a Pmo. In place in your organization.

1625
02:45:15.850 --> 02:45:24.220
Orlando Sequera: you have the Predict staff members. These are your team members doing the work. They're the ones that are producing the project deliverables

1626
02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:27.159
Orlando Sequera: for the project. Then you also have

1627
02:45:27.490 --> 02:45:32.060
Orlando Sequera: experts that can provide you assistance whenever needed.

1628
02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:33.850
Orlando Sequera: depending on the areas

1629
02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:46.200
Orlando Sequera: that depending on the area of your project, for example, with the software for the kind of department we might need help from a. Cpa. A certified public account, and that is an expert in regular in

1630
02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:52.860
Orlando Sequera: the in surveillance. Oxley, for example. That's what we're using for accounting principles socks.

1631
02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:55.060
Orlando Sequera: Then we need an expert in socks

1632
02:45:55.090 --> 02:45:58.390
Orlando Sequera: that can help us to make sure that we are compliant with socks

1633
02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:08.990
Orlando Sequera: for our accounting software. So that's an example of a super next one, and we usually need them for specific points in time in our project, and we also have

1634
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:10.460
Orlando Sequera: business

1635
02:46:11.070 --> 02:46:13.630
Orlando Sequera: that are going to be supporting that the partnership.

1636
02:46:15.450 --> 02:46:27.810
Orlando Sequera: One key aspect is that we need to be able to identify the resources that we need. Remember that it. When we talk about resources, it's not only a about

1637
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:33.839
Orlando Sequera: people. We're also talking about equipment, materials and supplies. But we need to know how much.

1638
02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:46.139
Orlando Sequera: how much of it do we need, and also how many people do we need? Do you need to be able to answer a few questions If the team going to have enough of the relevant skill set to do the work and produce the design results

1639
02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:48.340
Orlando Sequera: we have to try.

1640
02:46:48.500 --> 02:47:05.349
Orlando Sequera: Second bullet point here is critical. We have to as much as possible. No, it's not always going to be possible. We have to try to avoid single points of failure. We one ideally to have people that can do more than one thing, though those receive the name of

1641
02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:16.129
Orlando Sequera: generalize specialists that you see in the fourth bullet point here, we want people that can do more than one thing ideally. Is it going to be always possible? No.

1642
02:47:16.250 --> 02:47:26.529
Orlando Sequera: But we should strive for that. One way of doing that is, through cross training, having cross-functional teams. Okay, so that's how we can avoid. And

1643
02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:37.670
Orlando Sequera: T-shaped people we mean that people that can stretch their skill set, and they can learn, for example, software coders that can also do testing.

1644
02:47:38.310 --> 02:47:57.500
Orlando Sequera: That's an example of T-shaped people. So that's how we can avoid those single points of failures. And Again, we need to also need a to quantify and understand how much resources, what are, how many the resources, the equipment and supplies that we need to complete our project.

1645
02:47:57.510 --> 02:48:12.900
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's also extremely important for us to understand. It's not just about the people. It's also about the materials, equipment, and supplies. If we need a 3D printer, how many, if we need access to conference rooms, access to printers, a access to a specialized.

1646
02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:25.480
Orlando Sequera: a piece of equipment that we only have one in the organization or let alone. We don't even have one in the organization. We have to go outside and get it from a supplier. We need to identify those resource requirements.

1647
02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:26.930
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1648
02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:29.550
Orlando Sequera: we also need

1649
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:32.520
Orlando Sequera: and a little bit going.

1650
02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:36.239
Orlando Sequera: doing a deeper dive When it comes to T-shaped people

1651
02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:40.249
Orlando Sequera: we should instill that

1652
02:48:41.050 --> 02:48:53.469
Orlando Sequera: mentality with our team members. They should try to do more than just one thing. It's not just one specialist in just one single area. We should try to expand that knowledge.

1653
02:48:53.530 --> 02:49:10.499
Orlando Sequera: and that's what's gonna help us to be more successful. And to avoid those singles single points of failure. That is, we can achieve that for training cross training, and that's going to help them to even helps with motivation. People are always eager to learn a

1654
02:49:10.510 --> 02:49:28.050
Orlando Sequera: new functions in in a new new skill set. That's that's great that can help people to grow and develop. And one aspect that you also have to remember for both the Pmp. Exam. And project management is that we are in the business of developing people. We're in the basis of growing people.

1655
02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:33.790
Orlando Sequera: This can help individuals to add more value. A helps the organization. And

1656
02:49:33.850 --> 02:49:36.290
Orlando Sequera: would you avoid single points of failure?

1657
02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:45.579
Orlando Sequera: Any can in special, in situations in which resources are scars which is most organizations are going through that and that can help

1658
02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:48.410
Orlando Sequera: we tremendously, with

1659
02:49:48.740 --> 02:49:51.129
Orlando Sequera: the chances of being successful with your team.

1660
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:58.970
Orlando Sequera: A few aspects that we also have to take into account. When we are forming our teams. We have

1661
02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:00.340
Orlando Sequera: diversity.

1662
02:50:01.050 --> 02:50:02.630
Orlando Sequera: Chances are that

1663
02:50:02.730 --> 02:50:07.789
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be working with a global team with a diverse team people from different cultures, and

1664
02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:19.350
Orlando Sequera: the goal should be to leverage that as a strength, notice a limitation, not as a constraint. Notice a weakness. We should leverage that we can have a more thorough and more enhanced

1665
02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:20.090
a

1666
02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:35.420
Orlando Sequera: approach. Looking at it from different angles, we gotta take that into account. So we have to leverage that that diversity a as as a strength, and it's going to help us to be a to be successful in the goal. Here is

1667
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:37.920
Orlando Sequera: following those values that we

1668
02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:57.349
Orlando Sequera: briefly mentioned yesterday. Starting with respect, the goal should be to build trust within our team members. Okay, that's that's ideal. Is it? Easy? No. But we have to work. That's part of your job as a project manager as well to make sure that the teams can work and be able to build for us amongst themselves

1669
02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:01.289
Orlando Sequera: One

1670
02:51:02.050 --> 02:51:06.619
Orlando Sequera: This is another common aspect, this another tool that you're going to start seeing

1671
02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:08.490
Orlando Sequera: in.

1672
02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:18.029
Orlando Sequera: It is throughout the content it's about expert judgment. Expertise is this glorified common sense that we develop through experience.

1673
02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:25.959
Orlando Sequera: expert judgement, expertise. Whenever you see this in your Pmp. Exam expert judgment expertise.

1674
02:51:25.970 --> 02:51:45.619
Orlando Sequera: do not assume that you have to have that expertise, that expert judgment. Mainly. You might have some of it as the Pm. Because you might have worked in similar products in the past, but it mainly comes from your team members. They're the ones that are doing the work. They are the experts. They are

1675
02:51:45.930 --> 02:51:54.949
Orlando Sequera: the ones that have mainly the expert judgment comes from them because they are the ones that are doing the work. We are not doing the actual project work. The team members are

1676
02:51:54.980 --> 02:52:11.050
Orlando Sequera: okay. We might have some of the knowledge. But the expertise is gonna come from the subject matter. Experts and people that are doing the work. We might not have them internally, and if that's the case, we might use consultants, we might use

1677
02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:15.340
Orlando Sequera: historical data. We might leverage a

1678
02:52:15.450 --> 02:52:20.109
Orlando Sequera: external associations or professional association. We, if we Don't have that

1679
02:52:20.210 --> 02:52:35.700
Orlando Sequera: expert judgment, that expertise in-house we need to get it from somewhere. It could be from somewhere else in the organization, or it could be even the outside of the organization. We need to have that expertise. You're gonna see this expert judgment as a recurring

1680
02:52:35.970 --> 02:52:36.810
Orlando Sequera: theme

1681
02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:44.020
Orlando Sequera: throughout the content. But remember that it's not just from your from you as the project manager.

1682
02:52:45.070 --> 02:52:46.020
Orlando Sequera: Also.

1683
02:52:46.310 --> 02:52:48.590
Orlando Sequera: we should focus always on

1684
02:52:48.810 --> 02:52:50.140
Orlando Sequera: team strings.

1685
02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:57.499
Orlando Sequera: A. We should perform a a a slow analysis for that. Try to identify the so. The yes comes from strength.

1686
02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:02.480
Orlando Sequera: The W comes from witnesses, and then opportunities and threats

1687
02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:10.710
Orlando Sequera: that those are risks. By the way. We will cover that when we get to risk identification to understand, and we should always

1688
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:18.939
Orlando Sequera: organize your teams around their strengths and be aware of their weaknesses. As well try to address them as they come.

1689
02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:22.010
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect is

1690
02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:25.250
Orlando Sequera: team norms.

1691
02:53:25.290 --> 02:53:32.149
Orlando Sequera: These are the behaviors. These are the agreed standards of conduct that we are going to follow as a team.

1692
02:53:32.390 --> 02:53:36.790
Orlando Sequera: This is what's going to happen. What's going to help us to navigate that

1693
02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:44.059
Orlando Sequera: A project work the best way possible the rules of engagement basically and how we're gonna work as a project team

1694
02:53:44.370 --> 02:53:51.720
Orlando Sequera: they can. We're gonna have the guidance for meetings here. We're gonna meet every day at 9 am. For 50 min.

1695
02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:55.229
Orlando Sequera: If someone sends an email.

1696
02:53:55.270 --> 02:54:02.670
Orlando Sequera: we respect the reply within 30 min or less, someone since someone leaves a voicemail, we expect to reply within 30 min or less.

1697
02:54:03.250 --> 02:54:08.380
Orlando Sequera: This is the escalation path that we're going to use for conflict management.

1698
02:54:08.430 --> 02:54:24.090
Orlando Sequera: These are our share values as a team, and this is the decision making process that we are going to follow. These are the norms that we're going to use as a team that those are the respective behaviors. Any violations of these behaviors can

1699
02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:27.850
Orlando Sequera: result in sanctions for the team members. But

1700
02:54:28.050 --> 02:54:36.410
Orlando Sequera: we build this as a team. We build this team norms as a team, and this everybody chimes in, and this is what we're going to follow, and we almost.

1701
02:54:36.430 --> 02:54:37.500
Orlando Sequera: But he's

1702
02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:40.439
Orlando Sequera: your job to help the team to

1703
02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:50.930
Orlando Sequera: A to to address and overcome this situation, especially when it comes to conflict management. But these are the norms. These are rules of engagement that we have to follow to. We in order to work as a team.

1704
02:54:51.550 --> 02:54:53.630
Orlando Sequera: Bmi provides

1705
02:54:53.870 --> 02:55:02.660
Orlando Sequera: a code of ethics that is huge. That's a key aspect that we have to remember. Pmi provides a code of ethics that has

1706
02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:10.019
Orlando Sequera: the values. These are the values, responsibility, respect, parents, and honesty. And

1707
02:55:10.390 --> 02:55:13.919
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the Pmi to the Pmp. Exam.

1708
02:55:14.130 --> 02:55:15.320
Orlando Sequera: Always

1709
02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:16.170
Orlando Sequera: keep

1710
02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:19.599
Orlando Sequera: ethics always do the right thing.

1711
02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:30.830
Orlando Sequera: Always do the right thing. Okay, so review it. It is available. You can go to pmi.org. And you can review in detail if you want. And it describes the

1712
02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:34.989
Orlando Sequera: perspective, ethical and professional behavior of a project manager.

1713
02:55:35.170 --> 02:55:48.009
Orlando Sequera: And if this is gonna permeate in everything that we do As a project manager. It's part of the best practices in grain, and the best practice that we follow as a project manager, the code of Ethics. Okay, really, really, really important.

1714
02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:49.119
Orlando Sequera: So

1715
02:55:52.530 --> 02:55:56.729
Orlando Sequera: next, we have a document that we create as a team

1716
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:58.160
Orlando Sequera: that has

1717
02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:10.949
Orlando Sequera: that we call the team charter that has the values, the behavior guidelines, those thing north that we worked on. They're gonna be put together in this document that we call the team charter.

1718
02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:21.599
Orlando Sequera: the guidance for communications, the decision making guidelines, conflict resolution measures. Basically the team norms are going to be put together in this document that we call team charter.

1719
02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:22.630
Orlando Sequera: This is

1720
02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:30.910
Orlando Sequera: important. This is going to keep everyone on the same page. It's going to drive those behaviors, and it's going to establish those crown rules that we have to follow

1721
02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:32.740
Orlando Sequera: Burk as a team.

1722
02:56:34.590 --> 02:56:36.020
Orlando Sequera: This is an example

1723
02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:39.150
Orlando Sequera: of a team charter for one of our projects.

1724
02:56:39.330 --> 02:56:55.550
Orlando Sequera: Then we have the project team name, for example, a a lot of information, but at the bottom these are the team guidelines. Working hours are from 8 am. To 5 Pm. For the office on site. Workings are posted on site, and they change daily.

1725
02:56:55.570 --> 02:57:13.010
Orlando Sequera: We need to use relevant messages in work. Chats be on time to meetings, ask for help when you need it, communicate honestly and openly. So this is an example of a team chartered. These. These are the ground rules that we have to follow as a team. Be polite, respect everyone's opinion.

1726
02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:14.860
Orlando Sequera: speak to people directly

1727
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:15.960
Orlando Sequera: before

1728
02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:27.750
Orlando Sequera: airing grievances in public. So those are the ground rules for this project for shop industries, for the lifestyle center. This is just an example. These changes for project to project

1729
02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:31.270
Orlando Sequera: Another important topic is

1730
02:57:32.770 --> 02:57:34.480
Orlando Sequera: team communication.

1731
02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:36.509
Orlando Sequera: We have to decide

1732
02:57:38.210 --> 02:57:42.340
Orlando Sequera: which communication approach. Are we going to follow? But the again

1733
02:57:42.970 --> 02:57:45.600
Orlando Sequera: communication happens in multiple ways.

1734
02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:52.999
Orlando Sequera: It but we need to be able, if we to be able to remember? That is, there's verbal communication written communication, but it's also

1735
02:57:53.070 --> 02:58:07.669
Orlando Sequera: body language. It's behavioral communication. We've got to pay attention to those body language queues some. There's some notice boards that will be physical communication, and even virtual communication. It is important that we

1736
02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:16.109
Orlando Sequera: are specific when it comes to the communication expectations, as we saw in the previous example in the team charter

1737
02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:33.910
Orlando Sequera: to understand what is expected from our team members to be on time for meetings. A phone call has to be a voicemail replied, has to be answered, replied. Within 30 min or an hour. An email has to be reply within 30 min or an hour within working hours, of course.

1738
02:58:33.930 --> 02:58:38.569
Orlando Sequera: and this is not setting stone. This can change

1739
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:41.149
Orlando Sequera: as the team sees fit

1740
02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:49.380
Orlando Sequera: to whatever works for them, and that's why we can work on lessons. Learned a. We can have a session and let us learn

1741
02:58:49.540 --> 02:58:56.880
Orlando Sequera: retrospective session with the team to try to come up with an improvement if our ground rules are not working.

1742
02:58:57.540 --> 02:58:59.970
Orlando Sequera: But we have to be able to determine that

1743
02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:01.690
Orlando Sequera: for the team.

1744
02:59:01.960 --> 02:59:02.789
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1745
02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:03.910
Orlando Sequera: then.

1746
02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:09.220
Orlando Sequera: do we need to be in the same space

1747
02:59:09.340 --> 02:59:10.480
Orlando Sequera: at all time.

1748
02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:11.980
Orlando Sequera: A.

1749
02:59:12.470 --> 02:59:27.799
Orlando Sequera: Can we be collocated? Can we be virtual? It depends it. These changes from organization to organization in the last 3 years we have seen that it is possible to work remotely. Some organizations learn that the hard way some of them they already knew it.

1750
02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:31.870
Orlando Sequera: but and it's becoming more normal. In most workplaces.

1751
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:46.089
Orlando Sequera: It has some positives, but it also has some challenges. Is building that frost building that that relationship is harder when you're working in a in a virtual setting.

1752
02:59:46.320 --> 02:59:58.719
Orlando Sequera: but in a co-located team. Everybody in the same physical space within 6 feet, or I want to say for those of you that use the metric system, as I think, is 1.8 meters

1753
02:59:58.900 --> 03:00:04.999
Orlando Sequera: 6 feet. If i'm not mistaken, the interaction is easier is better bonding.

1754
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:18.000
Orlando Sequera: It's easier to build trust, and it's easier to it. It's it's conducive to collaboration in a more, a in an easier way, but it is still possible, following a virtual approach.

1755
03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:20.039
Orlando Sequera: But a

1756
03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:23.820
Orlando Sequera: what? We it it's just part of reality nowadays.

1757
03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:26.389
Orlando Sequera: Changes from organization to organization.

1758
03:00:26.750 --> 03:00:27.410
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1759
03:00:27.430 --> 03:00:36.179
Orlando Sequera: And i'm sure that some of you work under a virtual team approach, or some of you work allocated, and that's perfectly fine.

1760
03:00:37.610 --> 03:00:41.150
Orlando Sequera: These are some of the challenges that we have for virtual teams

1761
03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:42.350
Orlando Sequera: is heart

1762
03:00:43.370 --> 03:00:45.270
Orlando Sequera: to keep the individual

1763
03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:50.080
Orlando Sequera: to track the video performance, and people can feel isolated

1764
03:00:50.880 --> 03:01:00.669
Orlando Sequera: and remember, it's not about command and control. We are. It's about making sure that people are performing their best. It is also a problem, especially when you have

1765
03:01:00.820 --> 03:01:11.569
Orlando Sequera: diverse teams. It can be challenging different time zones a technological scale level might be different. That might be tougher, and also

1766
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:13.070
Orlando Sequera: a

1767
03:01:13.130 --> 03:01:14.989
Orlando Sequera: building that trust

1768
03:01:15.310 --> 03:01:31.790
Orlando Sequera: with your team members can be a little bit more challenging. So the answer one of the recommendations for that will be to have at least a face to face a meeting. At at least one try to have it, if if at all possible. We'll try to figure out ways

1769
03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:35.930
Orlando Sequera: to build a that for us and build that

1770
03:01:36.460 --> 03:01:37.490
Orlando Sequera: A.

1771
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:41.780
Orlando Sequera: For to promote that bonding between team members. That is really important.

1772
03:01:42.950 --> 03:01:44.449
Orlando Sequera: And also

1773
03:01:44.870 --> 03:02:03.420
Orlando Sequera: when you're running virtual teams check in with people. This is for you as the Pm. Check in with them as much as possible. It requires more oversight, more engagement on your part and try to work on positive network building activities. That's also really important. It. It is possible, even in a virtual

1774
03:02:03.430 --> 03:02:19.969
Orlando Sequera: a way. But try to some. Some. Some organizations are creative with this, and they's not. They have meetings to talk about sports or something that they like. It's not just about. We're trying to build that trust as much as possible.

1775
03:02:20.780 --> 03:02:30.379
Orlando Sequera: E. When it comes to virtual communication technology. We have multiple tools that we can use a task force like Jira, for example.

1776
03:02:30.540 --> 03:02:40.199
Orlando Sequera: instant messaging calendars, document storage, video conferencing like zoom, for example. But one thing that I wanted to point out. They

1777
03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:47.460
Orlando Sequera: fact that we have. The technology does not replace the need for planning for the communication, or that some replace.

1778
03:02:47.770 --> 03:02:49.770
Orlando Sequera: They need to communicate

1779
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:55.779
Orlando Sequera: what I'm trying to say. Not because we have Microsoft teams that doesn't mean that we have to that. Would

1780
03:02:56.080 --> 03:03:07.499
Orlando Sequera: we have Microsoft teams we don't have to. We don't have to have meetings every day. We don't have to check in with our people. No, we that is just the medium, the technology. We still have to plan for our

1781
03:03:07.820 --> 03:03:08.680
Orlando Sequera: a

1782
03:03:09.330 --> 03:03:14.559
Orlando Sequera: communications and make sure that we have our expectations. A

1783
03:03:14.770 --> 03:03:17.039
Orlando Sequera: clearly defined in the team charter

1784
03:03:17.850 --> 03:03:31.749
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more about addressing the virtual team needs. We have to facilitate their collaboration. We have to. It's more challenging. It requires more oversight for you. As a Pm. But it's about building that

1785
03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:33.390
Orlando Sequera: a collision

1786
03:03:33.530 --> 03:03:37.479
Orlando Sequera: circles that purpose a and

1787
03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:55.390
Orlando Sequera: prior to fine roles and expectations. That's where the racing matrix is gonna come handy. We haven't talked about racing matrix. But it is a another artifact that we can create is response is basically stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, and inform, and that's

1788
03:03:55.400 --> 03:04:10.950
Orlando Sequera: one artifact that is gonna help us to make sure that we're on the same page when it comes to the project team to understand who is responsible for a task? Who's accountable? Who needs to be consulted? Who needs to be informed that's how we can address that clarity on roles and expectations.

1789
03:04:11.260 --> 03:04:14.580
Orlando Sequera: more oversight for virtual teams still possible.

1790
03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:16.909
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1791
03:04:17.490 --> 03:04:19.060
Orlando Sequera: We have covered

1792
03:04:20.190 --> 03:04:23.249
Orlando Sequera: how to empower team members and stakeholders.

1793
03:04:23.410 --> 03:04:30.160
Orlando Sequera: It's about strength. Build your build your team, organize your team about around around your strings

1794
03:04:31.290 --> 03:04:47.359
Orlando Sequera: A and short, not a transfer for continuity. So we went over this responsibilities within the team and the expectations for working environment team, charter round rules, team norms. And also we went over on how to engage and support virtual teams.

1795
03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:51.189
Orlando Sequera: So we are ready. We're getting ready. We have

1796
03:04:51.790 --> 03:04:54.969
Orlando Sequera: 5 min until we go for a break, actually 4,

1797
03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:56.510
Orlando Sequera: and

1798
03:04:56.740 --> 03:05:01.770
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna take the remaining 4 min to address any questions that

1799
03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:03.489
Orlando Sequera: are in the Q. And a.

1800
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:06.890
Orlando Sequera: At the top.

1801
03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:09.530
Orlando Sequera: And

1802
03:05:09.880 --> 03:05:13.990
Orlando Sequera: first one is our project. Managers tend to be responsible for hiring.

1803
03:05:16.590 --> 03:05:26.570
Orlando Sequera: Or is the program manager generally responsible for this. It depends on the organization which in some, if it's a projectized organization. Yes.

1804
03:05:27.310 --> 03:05:34.990
Orlando Sequera: that's why you have to understand the organizational structure in a functional organization. The answer will be No. In the project. T: the answer will be, yes.

1805
03:05:37.740 --> 03:05:39.949
Orlando Sequera: So it depends on the organization.

1806
03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:54.089
Orlando Sequera: Another question: how did you identify the number of team members. As we said before, if it's a predictive approach that you're following traditional, you need to understand this couple of the work and define the scope of the work.

1807
03:05:55.220 --> 03:05:59.339
Orlando Sequera: If it's agile, we to understand. At least

1808
03:06:01.470 --> 03:06:04.090
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna have an idea to you. Start

1809
03:06:04.340 --> 03:06:12.449
Orlando Sequera: to start with the with with your it's. It's gonna be done at the beginning, based on the initial understanding of the project.

1810
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:20.020
Orlando Sequera: So it really depends on the approach. But for predictive, the difference is that you need to understand this couple of work.

1811
03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:23.809
Orlando Sequera: You need to. We do that in planning, and then you

1812
03:06:24.030 --> 03:06:27.259
Orlando Sequera: put together the team. It's a little bit different depends on the approach.

1813
03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:30.070
Okay?

1814
03:06:30.130 --> 03:06:30.750
Orlando Sequera: Oh.

1815
03:06:32.830 --> 03:06:38.369
Orlando Sequera: one of the Prep. Work questions, asks, what is the biggest adversity adversity to

1816
03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:42.899
Orlando Sequera: a diverse team, and the answer was cultural differences, I wholeheartedly agree.

1817
03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:44.060
Orlando Sequera: That is

1818
03:06:45.070 --> 03:06:49.450
Orlando Sequera: the differences. The differences that will be, I guess, is.

1819
03:06:49.850 --> 03:06:55.530
Orlando Sequera: I will have to read the question with a little bit more detail. But

1820
03:06:55.710 --> 03:06:59.670
Orlando Sequera: that is one of the biggest challenges, and adversity is a challenge.

1821
03:07:01.240 --> 03:07:05.149
Orlando Sequera: So but I will need more context about the the specific question.

1822
03:07:09.230 --> 03:07:10.160
Orlando Sequera: right?

1823
03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:14.130
Orlando Sequera: Another question

1824
03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:17.210
Orlando Sequera: in agile do we still create the for each other?

1825
03:07:18.930 --> 03:07:20.240
Orlando Sequera: That's not.

1826
03:07:20.910 --> 03:07:32.020
Orlando Sequera: Yes, we do. We can create a pro charter for adjo we haven't covered that yet. But yes, we still can create. We still need to create a magic for a charter. It's less information would. Yes, we should.

1827
03:07:35.700 --> 03:07:37.620
Orlando Sequera: It's another question: Where did you?

1828
03:07:37.680 --> 03:07:42.710
Orlando Sequera: Where did you turn? If you are the first Pm. At a company? I don't really understand the

1829
03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:51.989
Orlando Sequera: context of that question. Will you do you start with best practices. Just you gotta start somewhere with best practices that we are sharing. I would say

1830
03:07:54.360 --> 03:07:56.479
Orlando Sequera: another question.

1831
03:07:56.500 --> 03:07:59.579
Orlando Sequera: Tips to bring things together faster

1832
03:08:00.180 --> 03:08:03.780
Orlando Sequera: when your team changes with everybody based on resource availability. Well.

1833
03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:19.980
Orlando Sequera: I like. I used to take my teams out to lunch once a month. I used to bring them If we were at the office we have. We were working hybrid. I used to bring them donuts or power bars a every Friday, so that's what I used to.

1834
03:08:20.350 --> 03:08:21.919
Orlando Sequera: That's what I used to do.

1835
03:08:22.420 --> 03:08:26.689
Orlando Sequera: and figure it out. Figure it out. But there's old.

1836
03:08:27.090 --> 03:08:32.509
Orlando Sequera: Get some help from the Hr Department. They have ways to build

1837
03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.280
Orlando Sequera: to actually team building

1838
03:08:35.590 --> 03:08:39.440
Orlando Sequera: activities. They might help you with that. But there are multiple ways that you can do. That

1839
03:08:41.650 --> 03:08:45.810
Orlando Sequera: Can you give an example of T-shaped team. Ideal teams are usually T-shaped.

1840
03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:51.710
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1841
03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:05.129
Orlando Sequera: Can you give an example of a time do you experience noise on a project with stakeholders every single project as noise, and you have to work on a address in it. Every single project has it.

1842
03:09:08.930 --> 03:09:15.679
Orlando Sequera: Why would you desires to go to be neutral. At least we said at least to be neutral, so they are not against our project.

1843
03:09:15.800 --> 03:09:23.339
Orlando Sequera: I don't want it. I don't remember that's the bare minimum. We don't want someone. We don't want a resistant stakeholder.

1844
03:09:23.420 --> 03:09:26.189
Orlando Sequera: All right, so we are ready for

1845
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:27.340
Orlando Sequera: our

1846
03:09:27.430 --> 03:09:28.740
Orlando Sequera: when our break

Orlando Sequera: to continue with the class

1856
03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:20.950
Orlando Sequera: Again, we're going to have some

1857
03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:26.610
Orlando Sequera: topping points in which we will be able to address your questions.

1858
03:10:27.080 --> 03:10:31.759
Orlando Sequera: Remember that content Questions. Go in the Q. A. All right.

1859
03:10:32.780 --> 03:10:38.499
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to continue with with our Pmp preparation class.

1860
03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:39.550
Orlando Sequera: Hopefully.

1861
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:41.120
Orlando Sequera: you were able to

1862
03:10:41.790 --> 03:10:45.769
Orlando Sequera: to rest a little bit, and we're continue to finish strong alright, so we can

1863
03:10:45.850 --> 03:10:47.649
Orlando Sequera: cover the content that we have

1864
03:10:47.700 --> 03:10:48.410
Orlando Sequera: left.

1865
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:50.660
Orlando Sequera: And we're going to start

1866
03:10:51.010 --> 03:10:53.750
Orlando Sequera: this portion of the content with

1867
03:10:54.210 --> 03:10:59.939
Orlando Sequera: building a shared understanding. So before we went and break, we were talking about forming the team.

1868
03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:06.790
Orlando Sequera: We we even watched the video on the Tuckman ladder with the 5 different stages of the information.

1869
03:11:07.430 --> 03:11:09.549
Orlando Sequera: and that happens in both

1870
03:11:09.790 --> 03:11:20.079
Orlando Sequera: predict, regardless of the approach, whether we're predictive or following a predictive approach or waterfall, or traditional. Or if we're following an agile approach or adaptive.

1871
03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:22.789
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna have to form a team

1872
03:11:22.810 --> 03:11:24.530
Orlando Sequera: right for our project.

1873
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:27.930
Orlando Sequera: So once we have that in place.

1874
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:33.890
Orlando Sequera: the next step, and we were also talking about identifying our our stakeholders.

1875
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:36.739
Orlando Sequera: a developing Australia to keep them engaged.

1876
03:11:37.440 --> 03:11:38.420
Orlando Sequera: Now.

1877
03:11:38.660 --> 03:11:40.140
Orlando Sequera: what we're gonna do is

1878
03:11:40.340 --> 03:11:45.610
Orlando Sequera: an important step in project management which is getting everyone on the same page.

1879
03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:49.970
Orlando Sequera: This is crucial. We have to be

1880
03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:51.959
Orlando Sequera: on the same.

1881
03:11:52.890 --> 03:11:54.639
Orlando Sequera: We have to be on the same page

1882
03:11:55.800 --> 03:12:07.519
Orlando Sequera: we have to be aligned, and that that's what we're trying to do with build a sharing understanding. This is a key aspect of any project, regardless of the approach we have to be

1883
03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:11.450
Orlando Sequera: working. We have to be on the same page in regards to

1884
03:12:11.640 --> 03:12:23.789
Orlando Sequera: it. They go also the project. What the stakeholders, what the customers are expecting. The team members have to be on the same page, and that's something that we have to to work with the team and with the stakeholders.

1885
03:12:23.940 --> 03:12:32.529
Orlando Sequera: We also have to put the team in that position to understand the importance of the project. Why is the organization willing to invest money.

1886
03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:40.449
Orlando Sequera: time and resources on that particular project, just as we said yesterday, that's align with the strategic objectives. Okay.

1887
03:12:40.530 --> 03:12:41.400
Orlando Sequera: in

1888
03:12:42.040 --> 03:13:01.039
Orlando Sequera: the goal here is to foster collaboration our project team members. They need to collaborate with other stakeholders. So that's what we're trying to set the foundation for. With this aspect of building a share. Understanding. This is crucial. This is a key aspect of any project.

1889
03:13:02.200 --> 03:13:03.030
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1890
03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:10.210
Orlando Sequera: then.

1891
03:13:10.570 --> 03:13:12.580
Orlando Sequera: The goal here is

1892
03:13:14.150 --> 03:13:15.020
Orlando Sequera: that

1893
03:13:15.330 --> 03:13:17.730
Orlando Sequera: we have to look for consensus

1894
03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:26.090
Orlando Sequera: for the project among the team. Member and stakeholders get everyone on the same page. That's what we're trying to do here

1895
03:13:26.120 --> 03:13:27.170
Orlando Sequera: in.

1896
03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:34.269
Orlando Sequera: We have a few principles here. How can we do that right? You might be wondering great. Okay, you're talking about giving them on the same page

1897
03:13:34.570 --> 03:13:37.739
Orlando Sequera: we have to for their collaboration. So how do we do that

1898
03:13:39.270 --> 03:13:47.790
Orlando Sequera: the first this is where the this aspect of leadership comes into play we have to

1899
03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:51.869
Orlando Sequera: You were. Chances are that we're not going to have the level of a 30,

1900
03:13:51.930 --> 03:13:57.139
Orlando Sequera: so we have to use leadership. So we have to demonstrate we have to.

1901
03:13:57.220 --> 03:13:58.100
Orlando Sequera: They as

1902
03:13:58.220 --> 03:14:18.060
Orlando Sequera: say, here in the States. This is a idiomatic expression when I use it. Nonetheless it we have to walk the talk. We have to demonstrate those leadership behaviors. We have to follow those guidelines that we set for the team in the team. Charter follow those guidelines, follow that leadership.

1903
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:21.729
Orlando Sequera: the Serbian leadership approach, and we have to.

1904
03:14:22.820 --> 03:14:24.750
Orlando Sequera: We have to basically

1905
03:14:25.150 --> 03:14:33.589
Orlando Sequera: be a role model for those leadership behaviors that we're expecting everyone else to to follow. If you make, for example.

1906
03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:35.420
Orlando Sequera: honored your commitments

1907
03:14:36.050 --> 03:14:48.190
Orlando Sequera: it as much as possible. If you promise something that you're gonna deliver, then do that and communicate. Be on time. You're asking everyone else to be on time for your meetings for your calls. Be on time.

1908
03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:50.829
Orlando Sequera: Listen to everyone else.

1909
03:14:50.990 --> 03:15:07.280
Orlando Sequera: Understand that there are different points of view, and some in some cases they're gonna be contradicting, and they're gonna be country. They're gonna be. They're gonna be the opposite to what even you think as a project manager, so understand and basically show

1910
03:15:07.740 --> 03:15:15.820
Orlando Sequera: be a role model for those leadership behaviors that you're expecting everyone else to follow it. It's kind of contagious. It's it's contagious.

1911
03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:17.820
Orlando Sequera: The second one is

1912
03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.159
Orlando Sequera: make sure that

1913
03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:38.699
Orlando Sequera: especially your team members understand that it is that we're we're working on this project to add value. We're developing this software for the canon department to add value to the organization to help them to reduce to increase the efficiency of their operations by 20% in the next fiscal year.

1914
03:15:38.780 --> 03:15:39.690
Orlando Sequera: Excuse me.

1915
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:44.630
Orlando Sequera: that's why we're working on this project. We have to be diligent.

1916
03:15:44.680 --> 03:15:51.039
Orlando Sequera: We have to be respectful, and more importantly, as I mentioned before, we have to be, as toward of

1917
03:15:51.380 --> 03:16:00.190
Orlando Sequera: our project, where this towards off those resources that the organization is willing to spend on that project, we are this 2 words of that

1918
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:04.579
Orlando Sequera: we have to be able to navigate complexity.

1919
03:16:05.410 --> 03:16:08.669
Orlando Sequera: It's going to happen. It's simply a fact of life.

1920
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:12.840
Orlando Sequera: and especially it's going to happen.

1921
03:16:12.940 --> 03:16:20.390
Orlando Sequera: especially at the beginning, where you're trying to get to know the stakeholders, and you're trying to understand the scope of the work that you have to

1922
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:24.180
Orlando Sequera: completing. Your project is going to happen. So navigate that it's about

1923
03:16:24.690 --> 03:16:30.390
Orlando Sequera: active listening. Relying on your team members. Remind your experts and keep

1924
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:33.419
Orlando Sequera: keep it. Keep it keeping

1925
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:36.270
Orlando Sequera: keeping a steady.

1926
03:16:36.660 --> 03:16:37.449
I can.

1927
03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:46.329
Orlando Sequera: keeping everything under control. Not really. Your emotions. Dictate your actions, keeping a keeping calm, basically and also

1928
03:16:46.580 --> 03:16:49.029
Orlando Sequera: being able to adapt.

1929
03:16:49.340 --> 03:16:50.690
Orlando Sequera: be able

1930
03:16:50.750 --> 03:16:52.689
Orlando Sequera: to be resilient.

1931
03:16:52.940 --> 03:17:06.720
Orlando Sequera: Not everything is gonna be always blue sky, clear skies and beautiful weather. No, you're gonna have some storms. Be resilient. Be ready for that. Okay. Be ready for that to put

1932
03:17:07.090 --> 03:17:18.759
Orlando Sequera: and that way to be basically inspired, that for us it is. It's contagious, As I mentioned before, so inspire that trust your team members and your stakeholders as well. Okay. But

1933
03:17:20.130 --> 03:17:24.650
Orlando Sequera: one outcome of this process is going to be

1934
03:17:25.390 --> 03:17:27.669
Orlando Sequera: to create a couple of artifacts

1935
03:17:28.240 --> 03:17:29.829
Orlando Sequera: that are going to help you

1936
03:17:29.860 --> 03:17:32.250
Orlando Sequera: in getting everyone on the same page.

1937
03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:35.299
Orlando Sequera: The first one is the project charter.

1938
03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:41.419
Orlando Sequera: and the second one is the vision statement. These are artifacts.

1939
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:58.480
Orlando Sequera: specific documents on your project that are going to help you in getting everyone on the same page in reaching consensus about what the project is, you can always refer to them, and we're gonna talk about. We're gonna talk about them a little bit more

1940
03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:00.180
Orlando Sequera: Now.

1941
03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:07.949
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to building a share understanding.

1942
03:18:10.100 --> 03:18:18.690
Orlando Sequera: How do you go about building a share understanding. Again, it depends on the project context. I ha as I keep mentioning, and I have seen some of your questions

1943
03:18:18.830 --> 03:18:29.720
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. And a. Are very specific to our specific situations. But remember, there's not a silver bullet. Answer. Each project is different. Each organization is different. Even

1944
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:33.070
Orlando Sequera: projects within the same organization are going to be different.

1945
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:43.469
Orlando Sequera: So it's really hard to give a there, there's not really a silver bullet answer for every single situation that is gonna work in every single instance. That's not the case.

1946
03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:59.270
Orlando Sequera: You were. We're giving you tools. We're giving you best practices that you have to tailor. That's part of your job as a project manager. Do you have? Imagine these tools and techniques and and best practices as tools in your toolkit? You have to learn how to use

1947
03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:10.859
Orlando Sequera: it. The best tool for your situation. How do you do that? You start by understanding your environment, understanding your environment. That's where your those Eef and opa come into play

1948
03:19:11.250 --> 03:19:14.079
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to building a share understanding.

1949
03:19:16.090 --> 03:19:19.060
Orlando Sequera: you should start in sharing the agreement.

1950
03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:20.210
Orlando Sequera: That is

1951
03:19:20.390 --> 03:19:23.769
Orlando Sequera: the vision statement for your project and the project. Charter

1952
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:26.379
Orlando Sequera: with your stakeholders and the team.

1953
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:31.160
Orlando Sequera: then be willing to negotiate and reach an understanding on the agreements

1954
03:19:31.260 --> 03:19:34.729
Orlando Sequera: and work on the roles of responsibilities.

1955
03:19:35.050 --> 03:19:50.820
Orlando Sequera: the assignments, and that is specifically for the team and the project agreements. That's with the stakeholders. Okay, and that's the roles of responsibilities for that we create something that is called the racing matrix. But that's why some of you before I remember, since

1956
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:56.490
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. And a. About the racing for stakeholders. No, that is for team members.

1957
03:19:56.750 --> 03:20:03.109
Orlando Sequera: we can we? We mainly mainly 14 members. The product agreements, yes, agreed to negotiate.

1958
03:20:03.230 --> 03:20:08.129
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to product agreements with the stakeholders. Okay, and

1959
03:20:08.760 --> 03:20:11.889
Orlando Sequera: follow this agreement throughout the project.

1960
03:20:11.930 --> 03:20:16.340
Orlando Sequera: Follow these agreements for the project. And how do we do that for communication?

1961
03:20:18.460 --> 03:20:19.220
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1962
03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:29.390
Orlando Sequera: The project which you statement when a project begins.

1963
03:20:29.820 --> 03:20:30.860
Orlando Sequera: it is

1964
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:36.680
Orlando Sequera: payroll. It is critical to have a clear vision of what you're trying to accomplish.

1965
03:20:37.290 --> 03:20:40.109
Orlando Sequera: It is clear it is very important.

1966
03:20:40.220 --> 03:20:44.579
Orlando Sequera: and that you that involves the creation of a vision statement.

1967
03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:47.799
Orlando Sequera: This should come from the sponsor

1968
03:20:48.660 --> 03:20:52.710
Orlando Sequera: or from the product owner. If you're following an agile, or

1969
03:20:52.990 --> 03:20:56.629
Orlando Sequera: if if the organization is following an adaptive, gradual approach

1970
03:20:57.350 --> 03:21:03.909
Orlando Sequera: or key, stakeholders, not from you as the Pm. They should come from the product, owner, sponsor, or key stakeholders

1971
03:21:04.680 --> 03:21:05.500
Orlando Sequera: that.

1972
03:21:05.850 --> 03:21:19.369
Orlando Sequera: and this should be continually reinforced to the team throughout the project. This is at a high level, a clear vision of the desire objectives and the alignment of your project with the strategic goals.

1973
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:23.120
Orlando Sequera: and we should always go back

1974
03:21:23.250 --> 03:21:25.100
Orlando Sequera: to the provision statement.

1975
03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:25.949
Orlando Sequera: 2

1976
03:21:26.260 --> 03:21:35.089
Orlando Sequera: reinforce the message to our team members. This is where this is what we're trying to deliver to our customer. These are the goals that we have.

1977
03:21:35.280 --> 03:21:37.740
Orlando Sequera: That's contained in the project Visual statement.

1978
03:21:43.370 --> 03:21:44.560
Orlando Sequera: And then.

1979
03:21:45.220 --> 03:21:47.040
Orlando Sequera: as you are

1980
03:21:47.470 --> 03:21:50.609
Orlando Sequera: working on creating the project, Charter

1981
03:21:51.210 --> 03:21:52.640
Orlando Sequera: Project managers

1982
03:21:52.940 --> 03:21:53.640
Orlando Sequera: that

1983
03:21:53.770 --> 03:22:02.089
Orlando Sequera: need a better initial understanding of the project, they can benefit from existing agreements you might have.

1984
03:22:02.190 --> 03:22:05.460
Orlando Sequera: That's why we dig out and review any

1985
03:22:05.540 --> 03:22:08.850
Orlando Sequera: boundaries of negotiation for the Project agreement.

1986
03:22:09.230 --> 03:22:10.830
Orlando Sequera: Is there anything

1987
03:22:11.340 --> 03:22:26.430
Orlando Sequera: eligible for discussion or troubleshooting. And what are the desire objective for the products? So you need to understand this before you can work and deliver and and produce a the project Charter. And also how are you going to

1988
03:22:26.510 --> 03:22:32.580
Orlando Sequera: measure and assess organizational priorities and determine the ultimate objective for the project?

1989
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:40.690
Orlando Sequera: This is where critical thinking. And by the way, that's a key aspect of the Pmp. Exam: is it's a 100% of our critical thinking.

1990
03:22:40.840 --> 03:22:42.380
Orlando Sequera: Google thinking Skills

1991
03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:46.140
Orlando Sequera: a are gonna help you in identifying how the project fits

1992
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:57.819
Orlando Sequera: within the organizational landscape. Okay, that's why so important to start. We talked about it yesterday. The organization of culture, understanding your land

1993
03:22:58.470 --> 03:23:04.660
Orlando Sequera: conversation, understanding your ecosystem within the organization that is crucial, that a step

1994
03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:09.000
Orlando Sequera: number one. Okay, and then use that critical thinking

1995
03:23:09.650 --> 03:23:18.249
Orlando Sequera: and try to come up with an understanding and how your project fits within that organization and landscape. That is critical.

1996
03:23:18.320 --> 03:23:19.270
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1997
03:23:20.140 --> 03:23:22.410
Orlando Sequera: how can we create that

1998
03:23:23.060 --> 03:23:25.860
Orlando Sequera: holistic understanding of the project

1999
03:23:28.470 --> 03:23:30.299
Orlando Sequera: work with your stakeholders.

2000
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:34.130
Orlando Sequera: get their input when it comes to their vision, and

2001
03:23:34.240 --> 03:23:35.500
Orlando Sequera: additional, input

2002
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:42.179
Orlando Sequera: and of course include the sponsor to clarify the visual statement to them, as well to the older stakeholders

2003
03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:46.010
Orlando Sequera: and leverage any initial agreements

2004
03:23:46.570 --> 03:23:51.300
Orlando Sequera: that might have to do with your project that might be applicable to your project.

2005
03:23:51.330 --> 03:23:55.869
Orlando Sequera: It could be contracts with external parties, remains or contracts.

2006
03:23:55.890 --> 03:24:01.639
Orlando Sequera: It could be Mo use memorandum of understanding with other organizations.

2007
03:24:01.720 --> 03:24:02.640
Orlando Sequera: Amy.

2008
03:24:02.670 --> 03:24:08.659
Orlando Sequera: sla service, level agreements, for example, letters of agreements, verbal agreements.

2009
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:16.119
Orlando Sequera: a communication between key stakeholders, statements of work, sow, and what are those?

2010
03:24:16.810 --> 03:24:24.669
Orlando Sequera: Those are examples of opa? That's why we also have to re. That's why we're vo pas right. So these are opa's.

2011
03:24:24.770 --> 03:24:29.269
Orlando Sequera: So review existing agreements. These are examples of opa's.

2012
03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:35.590
Orlando Sequera: Then we also need to refer to something that we mentioned yesterday about the justification of

2013
03:24:36.010 --> 03:24:47.780
Orlando Sequera: the project we also need to understand and review. This is something that we covered yesterday the business case. This is about the justification for the project Review that there's information that is going to help you

2014
03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:53.909
Orlando Sequera: A. To develop that that project, charter the visibility, study the benefits.

2015
03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:54.820
Orlando Sequera: They

2016
03:24:54.900 --> 03:24:59.040
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna help you to understand the level of authorization that is needed

2017
03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:04.529
Orlando Sequera: to continue working on project activities and also the business needs documentation

2018
03:25:04.810 --> 03:25:07.280
Orlando Sequera: that will help you to identify

2019
03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:10.799
Orlando Sequera: areas of the scope like high level deliverables.

2020
03:25:10.850 --> 03:25:20.319
Orlando Sequera: This is a prerequisite of an actual and formal business case, and it's gonna help you to describe requirements can help you to start working on understanding the scope of the work

2021
03:25:20.390 --> 03:25:26.620
Orlando Sequera: that you have to complete in your project. What needs to be done when it's to be created, when it is to be produced.

2022
03:25:26.720 --> 03:25:28.870
Orlando Sequera: and how has to perform.

2023
03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:31.849
Orlando Sequera: and then work with your

2024
03:25:34.730 --> 03:25:35.690
Orlando Sequera: work.

2025
03:25:36.090 --> 03:25:46.629
Orlando Sequera: You have to work with your stakeholders. You have to. It's about negotiation with them. Get them on the same page, and you also have to.

2026
03:25:47.400 --> 03:26:02.629
Orlando Sequera: On this. Get your input from your subject matter, experts from your team members that are working on the project so they can help with to understand that technical success criteria. And this is where you can check some Kpis

2027
03:26:02.770 --> 03:26:06.790
Orlando Sequera: for the organization, if they are applicable, any lessons, learned

2028
03:26:06.930 --> 03:26:16.120
Orlando Sequera: information and historical data that from previous projects that are similar in nature that might help you to understand that success criteria for your project.

2029
03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:32.959
Orlando Sequera: You review an important opa, which is a quality policy for your organization and for testing. If you have any testing for user acceptance, you it. What are the Uat requirements? If it's applicable to your project, this might not be applicable to your project.

2030
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:42.700
Orlando Sequera: Then you also need to understand the reporting criteria. How often you have to report. Ask the deliverables are being produced in your project, and

2031
03:26:42.770 --> 03:26:46.589
Orlando Sequera: the acceptance criteria for those deliverables

2032
03:26:46.930 --> 03:26:50.940
Orlando Sequera: users can provide acceptance of those deliverable. So

2033
03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:55.620
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna happen throughout your the life cycle of your project

2034
03:26:55.980 --> 03:27:03.120
Orlando Sequera: A. In add of projects. We use both aspects. We use what is called

2035
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:06.620
Orlando Sequera: an acceptance criteria that we also use in predictive.

2036
03:27:07.350 --> 03:27:12.910
Orlando Sequera: We use an acceptance criteria, but that's at the very specific requirement level

2037
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:16.179
Orlando Sequera: in agile we use acceptance criteria, plus

2038
03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:30.179
Orlando Sequera: something that is called a definition of tone, which is another check. I want you to think of the acceptance criteria as a checklist. This is what we have to check in order to say that something has been successfully completed. That's what it is in essence.

2039
03:27:30.270 --> 03:27:47.110
Orlando Sequera: definition of tone is another checklist that we have to be able to check all the elements in that checklist. To say that something was indeed completed. The difference is that acceptance script here. This is for agile. The acceptance criteria is at the requirement level, very specific

2040
03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:55.409
Orlando Sequera: at the requirement level, and the definition of Don is at a higher level. Every single requirement has to meet the definition of tone.

2041
03:27:55.540 --> 03:28:03.100
Orlando Sequera: Actually, the acceptance criteria is one element. It's the first element of the definition of done in agile projects.

2042
03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:09.249
Orlando Sequera: So we and we have to negotiate. We have to work with our stakeholders, regardless of the approach. This is

2043
03:28:09.320 --> 03:28:14.350
Orlando Sequera: through negotiations. So we are all on the same page when it comes to

2044
03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:15.270
Orlando Sequera: right.

2045
03:28:15.770 --> 03:28:18.059
Orlando Sequera: Excuse me, project success criteria.

2046
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.820
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2047
03:28:20.180 --> 03:28:21.860
Orlando Sequera: We have

2048
03:28:25.060 --> 03:28:26.360
Orlando Sequera: many.

2049
03:28:27.020 --> 03:28:30.789
Orlando Sequera: This, as we said before, this happens at the beginning of the project.

2050
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:35.330
Orlando Sequera: and this is where you have to use your

2051
03:28:35.440 --> 03:28:50.059
Orlando Sequera: soft skills, your interpersonal skills as a project manager through communication with your stakeholders and your team members. This is key getting everyone on the same page. This is crucial.

2052
03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:53.969
Orlando Sequera: This is crucial. This is where you have to use your

2053
03:28:54.800 --> 03:29:12.749
Orlando Sequera: active listening. This is where you have to use your negotiation. This is where you have to use multiple communication. It channels with your methods with your stakeholders, with your team members to get everyone on the same page. Agile has some specific.

2054
03:29:13.360 --> 03:29:14.140
Orlando Sequera: a

2055
03:29:14.390 --> 03:29:20.089
Orlando Sequera: tools and techniques that help with the getting it with getting everyone to understand the vision.

2056
03:29:20.800 --> 03:29:23.500
Orlando Sequera: They're very specific. We have a couple of exempt

2057
03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:28.929
Orlando Sequera: for agile, because the the difference with predictive.

2058
03:29:29.260 --> 03:29:30.390
Orlando Sequera: if the

2059
03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:40.429
Orlando Sequera: if we're following a predictive approach. That means that we're gonna be able to define the entire scope of the project. And by that I mean all the work that we have to

2060
03:29:40.450 --> 03:29:44.940
Orlando Sequera: produce for a project. Let's assume for a minute that we're trying to build

2061
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:48.259
Orlando Sequera: a house, a one story house.

2062
03:29:49.490 --> 03:29:53.800
Orlando Sequera: a 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, one story house.

2063
03:29:53.980 --> 03:29:56.630
Orlando Sequera: and in that, if if that's the case.

2064
03:29:56.770 --> 03:30:01.109
Orlando Sequera: I would say that a predictive approach is your best bet

2065
03:30:01.390 --> 03:30:11.580
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna be able to define the entire scope of the house, and then work with your team members to start to in those project activities to produce the one-story. House.

2066
03:30:11.770 --> 03:30:13.830
Orlando Sequera: But in some cases that's

2067
03:30:14.350 --> 03:30:17.429
Orlando Sequera: the the scope is gonna be complex

2068
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:21.779
Orlando Sequera: and or the scope is going to be changing. And in that specific case

2069
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:30.650
Orlando Sequera: we need to use an adaptive approach. It's gonna be your best bet because we're going to be changing. We're going to be making a lot of changes.

2070
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:40.670
Orlando Sequera: but we still need to know where we're going. That's why the vision is so important. We still need to know where we're going. We want to build a new

2071
03:30:41.370 --> 03:30:44.329
Orlando Sequera: type of engine for rockets

2072
03:30:44.400 --> 03:30:48.600
Orlando Sequera: to eventually go to Mars or and and beyond

2073
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:50.750
Orlando Sequera: right. We want to build a new technology

2074
03:30:50.790 --> 03:30:55.499
Orlando Sequera: for rocket engines, a. To go to Mars and beyond.

2075
03:30:55.960 --> 03:30:56.690
Orlando Sequera: So

2076
03:30:57.390 --> 03:31:00.739
Orlando Sequera: we know where we're going. That's the vision right. But

2077
03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:10.040
Orlando Sequera: how do we get there? It's not really that clear? But we need to still have a vision that's where this product box exercise

2078
03:31:10.120 --> 03:31:11.660
Orlando Sequera: which is getting

2079
03:31:11.720 --> 03:31:19.449
Orlando Sequera: your stakeholders to start talking about what they expect to see in that product service of result

2080
03:31:19.540 --> 03:31:38.569
Orlando Sequera: getting them to talk, to start giving you functionality that's gonna be that's gonna be really helpful. That's a good way. It's what we call the per box exercise. Imagine, for example, that we're trying to come up with a new streaming service to compete with Netflix to use a simpler example, right? So, using the product box. It will be

2081
03:31:38.580 --> 03:31:42.469
Orlando Sequera: they. We can have the name of the service.

2082
03:31:42.490 --> 03:31:49.579
Orlando Sequera: and then we can start with some. We start asking our stakeholders their

2083
03:31:49.720 --> 03:32:07.790
Orlando Sequera: what is the desired function that they will like to see? And we start making some notes, and that's in essence how we can conduct a prototype exercise. But the goal here is to understand the vision of so much a details for what we are trying to accomplish, what we're trying to produce, and the Xp. Metaphor

2084
03:32:08.930 --> 03:32:11.849
Orlando Sequera: and the Xp. By the way, that comes from

2085
03:32:11.930 --> 03:32:20.520
Orlando Sequera: another flavor of agile Remember that I told you. Gesture is a flagey agile is like ice cream, agile has multiple flavors

2086
03:32:20.940 --> 03:32:26.090
Orlando Sequera: from it's one of them from it's like the chocolate of agile, but it's not the only flavor.

2087
03:32:26.940 --> 03:32:32.379
Orlando Sequera: Xp is another flavor of agile, and it stands for extreme programming.

2088
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:37.369
Orlando Sequera: This technique is some metaphor which is a way

2089
03:32:37.640 --> 03:32:39.489
Orlando Sequera: to the veil of a mission.

2090
03:32:39.550 --> 03:32:51.070
Orlando Sequera: I've a vision. I'm: sorry, explain the complex idea in simple terms. So your team members and stakeholders can have

2091
03:32:51.450 --> 03:32:57.419
Orlando Sequera: a clear understanding where we're trying to go. An example will be. Let's assume that we're trying to

2092
03:32:57.630 --> 03:32:58.560
Orlando Sequera: a

2093
03:32:58.740 --> 03:33:04.120
Orlando Sequera: we're trying to build a mobile app that it's a music streaming mobile app

2094
03:33:04.530 --> 03:33:06.869
Orlando Sequera: to compete with Pandora, for example.

2095
03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:14.670
Orlando Sequera: and an Xp. Meta, for example, in that situation will be, we won this

2096
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:23.090
Orlando Sequera: this application to read your mind and play the Muse, play the songs that are

2097
03:33:23.480 --> 03:33:25.710
Orlando Sequera: based on your current state.

2098
03:33:25.760 --> 03:33:43.969
Orlando Sequera: based on your current emotional state at that particular time. We would like to build an a mobile app that can breed your mind. That's as an example a of an Xp metaphor, of course, a little bit more than than that. But it's basically 2 ways that we have in agile, because we don't really know how to get there.

2099
03:33:44.120 --> 03:33:56.889
Orlando Sequera: We know what we're we're going. We should know where we're going. That's why we're we're trying to come up with a vision, but we don't really know how to get there. That's what we're going to be working on in our project.

2100
03:33:57.090 --> 03:33:57.660
Orlando Sequera: all right

2101
03:34:02.930 --> 03:34:06.699
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the product. Charter. There's no single way

2102
03:34:06.750 --> 03:34:15.289
Orlando Sequera: to create a project, Charter. And regardless of the approach, whether you and that goes back to another question that I saw in the Q. A. Before we went in on break.

2103
03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:18.070
Orlando Sequera: Every project needs to have a

2104
03:34:18.370 --> 03:34:24.359
Orlando Sequera: an actual project, Charter, regardless of the approach. Whether it is an adjunct project or

2105
03:34:24.380 --> 03:34:32.400
Orlando Sequera: a predictive approach that we're following for project. We need to have a project charter the best analogy

2106
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:37.119
Orlando Sequera: that I have been able to come up with for a project. Charter is

2107
03:34:39.290 --> 03:34:40.830
Orlando Sequera: that of a

2108
03:34:41.640 --> 03:34:43.490
Orlando Sequera: birth certificate.

2109
03:34:43.980 --> 03:34:53.069
Orlando Sequera: That's what the project charter in essence is the project. Charter is the birth certificate of your project

2110
03:34:53.230 --> 03:34:59.910
Orlando Sequera: at this point in time when the procedure is created. That's when your project officially exists.

2111
03:35:00.680 --> 03:35:02.399
Orlando Sequera: is going to

2112
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:06.180
Orlando Sequera: you. Get the green light to start working on

2113
03:35:06.470 --> 03:35:13.870
Orlando Sequera: and in activities. It means the project manager. It authorizes the project. That's what it means to the project exists.

2114
03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:20.410
Orlando Sequera: and it gives you high level information about multiple areas of your project

2115
03:35:20.740 --> 03:35:24.699
Orlando Sequera: is the birth certificate of your project.

2116
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:30.530
Orlando Sequera: It authorizes the project manager to start working on project activities. Starting with planning.

2117
03:35:31.020 --> 03:35:37.290
Orlando Sequera: It gives the authorization to the program manager to start applying resources to project, to project work.

2118
03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:43.650
Orlando Sequera: It defines the business need and the rationale of why the organization is undertaking

2119
03:35:43.890 --> 03:35:45.070
Orlando Sequera: the project

2120
03:35:45.540 --> 03:35:46.650
Orlando Sequera: states

2121
03:35:46.730 --> 03:35:48.020
Orlando Sequera: the business sleep

2122
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:54.160
Orlando Sequera: that is approved at the Executive level and verifies alignment with those strategic goals

2123
03:35:54.530 --> 03:35:55.420
Orlando Sequera: in

2124
03:35:55.440 --> 03:36:01.739
Orlando Sequera: It gives everyone, including team members and stakeholders on the same page

2125
03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:05.449
Orlando Sequera: focusing on a clear project vision.

2126
03:36:05.780 --> 03:36:06.539
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2127
03:36:07.060 --> 03:36:13.109
Orlando Sequera: that is important. We need to have a project Charter. What do we include in the project, Charter?

2128
03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:18.519
Orlando Sequera: It's going to change. There's not

2129
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:19.810
Orlando Sequera: one

2130
03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:25.559
Orlando Sequera: single way to create a project. These changes from organization to organization.

2131
03:36:25.610 --> 03:36:27.150
Orlando Sequera: but this is

2132
03:36:27.250 --> 03:36:36.810
Orlando Sequera: these are the the fields are the most common in pro charters. They may in names the project sponsor, the project manager, key stakeholders.

2133
03:36:38.290 --> 03:36:43.870
Orlando Sequera: It provides a project description with high level information about requirements

2134
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:47.889
Orlando Sequera: for this couple of project, and also measurable objectives.

2135
03:36:47.980 --> 03:36:49.940
Orlando Sequera: It covers the business needs.

2136
03:36:50.580 --> 03:36:55.479
Orlando Sequera: It also has high level information about the schedule with milestones.

2137
03:36:55.650 --> 03:36:59.010
Orlando Sequera: By the way, a master is a significant event in a project.

2138
03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:02.570
Orlando Sequera: That's what it is. We'll cover that in detail later. When we get to schedule.

2139
03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:07.830
Orlando Sequera: it also provides you information about the assumptions for your project.

2140
03:37:08.270 --> 03:37:12.030
Orlando Sequera: Remember, we have, especially if we're following an and a predict

2141
03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:15.310
Orlando Sequera: what we have some assumptions.

2142
03:37:15.390 --> 03:37:17.960
Orlando Sequera: Basically Taking

2143
03:37:18.420 --> 03:37:20.910
Orlando Sequera: W. Taking a

2144
03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:28.329
Orlando Sequera: making assumption, an assumption is taking something to be true without having evidence. Okay, we can assume that we.

2145
03:37:28.810 --> 03:37:30.969
Orlando Sequera: a supplier. A is going

2146
03:37:30.990 --> 03:37:37.380
Orlando Sequera: the time, because in the past supplier a deliver on time is that is that a fact? No. But

2147
03:37:39.240 --> 03:37:57.669
Orlando Sequera: or based in that on. This was learned on previous experiences. So we're going to assume that they're going to deliver on time again. All right. So that's an example of an assumption in predictive. For imagine we have to make assumptions all the time as accurately as possible. By the way, we also gonna have some limitations on some boundaries.

2148
03:37:57.870 --> 03:38:14.689
Orlando Sequera: The product chart is gonna have. High level information about risks is also gonna have some high level information about the budget and information on the business case it's gonna have high level information about every single aspect of your project. Okay.

2149
03:38:14.700 --> 03:38:21.680
Orlando Sequera: every single. If this is the starting point that birth certificate. From this point on, I can start working on planning

2150
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:22.949
Orlando Sequera: and then

2151
03:38:23.360 --> 03:38:30.090
Orlando Sequera: do a deeper dive in those different areas. But I need to start somewhere, and that somewhere. Is the project. Charter.

2152
03:38:30.270 --> 03:38:31.110
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2153
03:38:32.540 --> 03:38:34.860
Orlando Sequera: this is an example of

2154
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:36.700
Orlando Sequera: a project charter

2155
03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:38.020
Orlando Sequera: for the shop.

2156
03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:42.430
Orlando Sequera: The shop Industries

2157
03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:49.019
Orlando Sequera: Lifestyle Center project that we have that we have been mentioning before and

2158
03:38:49.270 --> 03:38:54.220
Orlando Sequera: have in names the project manager. The sponsor has some contact information.

2159
03:38:54.280 --> 03:39:11.210
Orlando Sequera: and then information about the scope, information about the schedule project overview with risk information, the business case, the goals and metrics, and the expected deliverable. So. But, as you can see, this is one page, and this is very common is just how

2160
03:39:11.220 --> 03:39:24.330
Orlando Sequera: high level information, just high level information that you have about your project. Okay, Nothing more than high level information. That's what it is

2161
03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:31.070
Orlando Sequera: You need to. This gives you the green light to start working on your project as a project manager

2162
03:39:31.980 --> 03:39:33.100
Orlando Sequera: and

2163
03:39:33.150 --> 03:39:35.669
Orlando Sequera: A. From this point on you can start

2164
03:39:35.970 --> 03:39:43.489
Orlando Sequera: working, starting with planning activities, so you can then get a better understanding of the different areas of your project.

2165
03:39:43.730 --> 03:39:44.510
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2166
03:39:44.610 --> 03:39:46.119
Orlando Sequera: So let's

2167
03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:53.520
Orlando Sequera: go ahead, and i'm going to review the questions. Remember what we said before your

2168
03:39:54.270 --> 03:39:55.770
Orlando Sequera: content Questions.

2169
03:39:56.460 --> 03:39:59.040
Orlando Sequera: Go in the Q. And a. Section.

2170
03:39:59.810 --> 03:40:03.540
Orlando Sequera: and I am going to, and please feel

2171
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:05.869
Orlando Sequera: Please vote on those questions.

2172
03:40:08.220 --> 03:40:10.330
Orlando Sequera: and

2173
03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:14.159
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to start answering the questions. I have the most votes

2174
03:40:15.490 --> 03:40:16.369
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2175
03:40:16.530 --> 03:40:20.290
Orlando Sequera: Why is the product box exercise? Consider agile.

2176
03:40:21.390 --> 03:40:24.650
Orlando Sequera: It's not necessarily consider. Add.

2177
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:29.649
Orlando Sequera: it's mainly used in agile because it helps. It's a simple exercise that helps

2178
03:40:29.880 --> 03:40:30.699
Orlando Sequera: with

2179
03:40:30.780 --> 03:40:32.590
Orlando Sequera: a your

2180
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:36.129
Orlando Sequera: that helps with your

2181
03:40:37.100 --> 03:40:48.129
Orlando Sequera: developing the vision. But you can use it in an industry. It is used widely used in marketing, widely, using marketing, and, by the way, marketing is one of the actual

2182
03:40:48.760 --> 03:40:51.289
Orlando Sequera: industries that uses agile, the most

2183
03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:54.030
Orlando Sequera: so widely using that so it's not.

2184
03:40:54.070 --> 03:41:02.190
Orlando Sequera: You can use it in predictive, too, but it is widely used in in agile and in marketing absolutely. So

2185
03:41:02.400 --> 03:41:04.720
Orlando Sequera: that'll be the answer to that question.

2186
03:41:05.410 --> 03:41:13.060
Orlando Sequera: Will we see specific tools, techniques like Xp. Metaphor and pro by exercise for a job projects on the Pmp. Exam as

2187
03:41:13.500 --> 03:41:20.430
Orlando Sequera: options you might, you you might put again my main recommendation for that.

2188
03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:26.699
Orlando Sequera: The questions are scenario based. The questions are going to be the Pmp. Exam. Is is a smart.

2189
03:41:26.910 --> 03:41:29.779
Orlando Sequera: The Pmp. Exam. Is gonna try not. It's not

2190
03:41:29.810 --> 03:41:48.749
Orlando Sequera: trying to determine whether you know about the tools or not, or the definition of the tool that the Pmp. Exam. Is trying to determine. Do you know how to use these tools? When do you use these tools. That's what they're looking for, is it? Is a it's about critical thinking. So it's not about knowing the definitions it's about critical thinking.

2191
03:41:48.930 --> 03:41:49.699
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2192
03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:52.030
Orlando Sequera: Let me

2193
03:41:53.720 --> 03:41:55.310
Orlando Sequera: continue

2194
03:41:56.470 --> 03:41:58.610
Orlando Sequera: with the questions

2195
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:03.689
Orlando Sequera: in the park chatter.

2196
03:42:03.850 --> 03:42:08.250
Orlando Sequera: The product chatter has very similar concepts. As a base or

2197
03:42:08.330 --> 03:42:15.280
Orlando Sequera: P. O. R. D. We should be familiar to most military members who have done organizational stuff work. Thank you very much.

2198
03:42:19.450 --> 03:42:24.880
Orlando Sequera: Okay. You give an example program as well. We went over them. We went over a.

2199
03:42:25.690 --> 03:42:28.969
Orlando Sequera: You should work this. This is one of them. Then

2200
03:42:30.970 --> 03:42:32.759
Orlando Sequera: the project Charter, is one of them.

2201
03:42:35.230 --> 03:42:38.960
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the Q. And a.

2202
03:42:40.250 --> 03:42:50.220
Orlando Sequera: Can the sow or Pws be the charter. No, that's a set. Those are separate documents when you need those documents to create Those are inputs to the project Charter.

2203
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:57.749
Orlando Sequera: Those are inputs that you will use

2204
03:42:58.710 --> 03:43:01.650
Orlando Sequera: for 2 in order to create a project. Charter.

2205
03:43:05.270 --> 03:43:09.079
Orlando Sequera: We'll budget and timeline of it runs covered later. Yes.

2206
03:43:11.730 --> 03:43:14.260
Orlando Sequera: do charters have to be signed absolutely.

2207
03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:16.080
Orlando Sequera: Yes, they have to be.

2208
03:43:16.190 --> 03:43:20.579
Orlando Sequera: They have to be approved. They have to be. You gotta get some sign off, and

2209
03:43:20.640 --> 03:43:24.569
Orlando Sequera: it changes from organization to organization. Some of them are more.

2210
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:33.400
Orlando Sequera: Some of them have more controls in place. But then again, check with your Pmo. If you have one in place.

2211
03:43:33.450 --> 03:43:34.170
Orlando Sequera: but

2212
03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:38.429
Orlando Sequera: that's part of governance. That will be part of Governments

2213
03:43:38.580 --> 03:43:39.890
Orlando Sequera: project governments.

2214
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:45.890
Orlando Sequera: Another question Who prepares the project. Charter.

2215
03:43:45.920 --> 03:43:47.460
Orlando Sequera: Great question.

2216
03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:53.080
Orlando Sequera: The Pm. I. The Pm.

2217
03:43:53.130 --> 03:43:58.140
Orlando Sequera: The Pinball Guide. The Pinball Guide says that this sponsor has.

2218
03:43:58.360 --> 03:44:04.889
Orlando Sequera: if their sponsor is accountable for, the creation, has to make sure that the pro charter is created.

2219
03:44:04.930 --> 03:44:10.770
Orlando Sequera: But the project manager can assist the sponsor in creating the project. Charter.

2220
03:44:10.800 --> 03:44:15.570
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so it's a a join effort between the sponsor and

2221
03:44:15.810 --> 03:44:17.390
Orlando Sequera: and your

2222
03:44:19.220 --> 03:44:21.810
Orlando Sequera: and the project manager for the project.

2223
03:44:23.980 --> 03:44:25.109
Orlando Sequera: Great question.

2224
03:44:26.180 --> 03:44:32.340
Orlando Sequera: Who owns the product? Chatter? Well, you are this to of your project, your the project manager.

2225
03:44:35.060 --> 03:44:37.260
Orlando Sequera: the charter, have to be signed. Yes.

2226
03:44:38.840 --> 03:44:43.989
Orlando Sequera: Do we use for a chart for other projects? Yes, you. There is

2227
03:44:44.100 --> 03:44:49.059
Orlando Sequera: the type of agile project, Charter. We probably less information than this. But, yes.

2228
03:44:53.060 --> 03:45:02.360
Orlando Sequera: another question. If you experience delaying, getting your purch or approved, did you ask someone with more authority to join the project? No, you work with your sponsor, and make sure that these

2229
03:45:02.650 --> 03:45:04.620
Orlando Sequera: that that these gets approved.

2230
03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:13.690
Orlando Sequera: You were with your sponsor members. Sponsor is vested in making sure that this product is successful. So leverage your sponsor.

2231
03:45:16.580 --> 03:45:17.410
Okay?

2232
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:19.490
Oh.

2233
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:31.810
Orlando Sequera: to press the charter. As I mentioned before, it's a joint effort. The sponsor is accountable. Sponsor has to make sure that it gets done. But the Pm. Can work with the sponsoring, creating the pro charter.

2234
03:45:36.470 --> 03:45:48.430
Orlando Sequera: Another question: Did you keep okay in the pro chatter? Who will update the 10 to the tentative scheduled. You don't have to go back and update it. You based on the information that you have at this moment.

2235
03:45:49.020 --> 03:45:58.500
Orlando Sequera: That's the information that goes in there. But you will have throughout planning. You'll have to develop the actual schedule for your project. This is just a tentative

2236
03:46:00.270 --> 03:46:03.580
Orlando Sequera: scheduled high level schedule with some milestones

2237
03:46:03.600 --> 03:46:05.550
Orlando Sequera: which are

2238
03:46:06.250 --> 03:46:14.390
Orlando Sequera: significant events that occur in the project. But you have to work on developing the schedule. This is not the final schedule for your project. This is just high level

2239
03:46:14.480 --> 03:46:23.070
Orlando Sequera: information about the schedule. Everything in the Charter is high level. You need to drill down. You need to do a deeper dive in those different areas

2240
03:46:28.980 --> 03:46:30.240
Orlando Sequera: Do you keep track

2241
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:32.530
Orlando Sequera: of?

2242
03:46:33.740 --> 03:46:37.130
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the Q. A. Do you keep track

2243
03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:38.369
Orlando Sequera: of?

2244
03:46:38.480 --> 03:46:39.880
Orlando Sequera: Oh.

2245
03:46:43.660 --> 03:46:47.399
Orlando Sequera: all these documents? Yes, that's part of your job.

2246
03:46:53.440 --> 03:47:10.959
Orlando Sequera: Another question. That's an project team. Need the pro charter. Yes, we mentioned that before it, even in one of the slides. Every project needs a project. Charter, regardless of the approach. Who's responsible for it? Well, it could be. It's usually not the pro owner. The pro owner is responsible for the scope of the project.

2247
03:47:10.970 --> 03:47:13.680
Orlando Sequera: It's. Usually the team lead or scrum master

2248
03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:21.100
Orlando Sequera: nails.

2249
03:47:23.210 --> 03:47:28.599
Orlando Sequera: So initiating the pro charter is not the Pm's responsibility. This is, however.

2250
03:47:31.920 --> 03:47:34.079
Orlando Sequera: the parents responsibility to maintain

2251
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:36.719
Orlando Sequera: good question, and

2252
03:47:36.820 --> 03:47:42.850
Orlando Sequera: this project, Charter, is probably one, if not the only artifact that we're going to

2253
03:47:42.940 --> 03:47:47.230
Orlando Sequera: to create in our project that doesn't have to be updated.

2254
03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:48.280
Orlando Sequera: This is

2255
03:47:48.370 --> 03:47:52.840
Orlando Sequera: like a birth certificate. Right? You don't. Go back in time and change your birth certificate.

2256
03:47:53.010 --> 03:48:01.739
Orlando Sequera: You were born at a certain point in time. There's some information about you at that particular point in time. That is the starting point of your

2257
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:03.380
Orlando Sequera: legal life right?

2258
03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:13.379
Orlando Sequera: You don't go back and change it, or you shouldn't at least so same. It's a snapshot at that particular point in time. That is the same principle with the project, Charter.

2259
03:48:13.440 --> 03:48:24.470
Orlando Sequera: We don't have to go back and change it. By the way, don't fall for that rabbit hole we don't have to go back and update the project. Charter. That is our starting point we're going to.

2260
03:48:24.490 --> 03:48:26.179
Orlando Sequera: We go over the class, and

2261
03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:31.629
Orlando Sequera: when we start covering planning, we started with planning today. So we're gonna work

2262
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:47.999
Orlando Sequera: on the different areas of our project. And then we're going to be able to produce the to define the scope to define the budget for a project. This is just a starting point. We to start somewhere, and this is what the project Charter, is that somewhere that starting point.

2263
03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:49.380
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2264
03:48:49.770 --> 03:48:52.060
Orlando Sequera: what else? What else I else?

2265
03:48:56.620 --> 03:48:58.369
Orlando Sequera: Do you keep track

2266
03:48:58.580 --> 03:49:02.549
Orlando Sequera: of all your meetings and what I said you should

2267
03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:06.049
Orlando Sequera: keeping meeting minutes. You should keep track of everything. That is

2268
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:08.160
that, he said. Yes.

2269
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:13.800
Orlando Sequera: another question can share understanding, be sharing a vision mission statement.

2270
03:49:16.590 --> 03:49:18.150
Orlando Sequera: A.

2271
03:49:19.460 --> 03:49:23.550
Orlando Sequera: If for me i'm sorry if for mean

2272
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:28.890
and

2273
03:49:29.690 --> 03:49:43.839
Orlando Sequera: a new vision Sorry keeps crawling. So my apologies informing a new vision of vision statement it should be for and through collaboration to get. It should be formed through collaboration to get initial by in and get everyone on the same page. That's

2274
03:49:43.860 --> 03:49:45.280
Orlando Sequera: that's a true statement

2275
03:49:46.770 --> 03:49:49.200
Orlando Sequera: and another question.

2276
03:49:50.160 --> 03:50:05.539
Orlando Sequera: So that's the correct sponsor, determined the scope. No, no, no, no, no, that's what you have to work with. You have to work in understanding that work with the team members work with your stakeholders, but this is just at a high level at a high level. You have to work in planning

2277
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:09.460
Orlando Sequera: to define the scope of your project to understand that better

2278
03:50:12.980 --> 03:50:13.810
Orlando Sequera: will

2279
03:50:13.930 --> 03:50:19.999
Orlando Sequera: we be asked to very, very specific questions on on the exam, to determine best project approach.

2280
03:50:20.410 --> 03:50:23.759
Orlando Sequera: I will this, and I, you suggest the scenario is going to give you some hints

2281
03:50:24.130 --> 03:50:26.190
Orlando Sequera: on Whether it is

2282
03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:34.600
Orlando Sequera: a a predictive approach is a better, better. Your best PET, or vice versa. If it's an adaptive approach, you'll get some.

2283
03:50:34.770 --> 03:50:42.890
Orlando Sequera: You gotta pay attention, Read the questions thoroughly so, and so you can have an idea what type of approach is going to be your best bet.

2284
03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:47.560
Orlando Sequera: All right. So we're going to continue

2285
03:50:48.060 --> 03:50:49.070
Orlando Sequera: with

2286
03:50:49.890 --> 03:50:50.970
Orlando Sequera: the content.

2287
03:50:53.690 --> 03:50:57.460
Orlando Sequera: I think I have time for one more question before

2288
03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:11.610
Orlando Sequera: there's another question: Are these topics in chronological order for events occur in the project? That's a great question. That's a great question.

2289
03:51:12.680 --> 03:51:14.449
Orlando Sequera: I don't want you to.

2290
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:32.680
Orlando Sequera: Many of these processes occur simultaneously. This is what happens at the start of a project, but stakeholder, identification and project charter creation. They happen simultaneously. They do not happen sequentially. They happen. They happen at the same time. When you start your project.

2291
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:38.679
Orlando Sequera: So stakeholder, notification and development, development, the correct charter happen at the same time

2292
03:51:38.850 --> 03:51:40.949
Orlando Sequera: at the start of your project.

2293
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:42.449
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

2294
03:51:51.910 --> 03:51:54.320
Orlando Sequera: I have time for one more.

2295
03:52:10.110 --> 03:52:13.639
Orlando Sequera: You have used the example of a house in develop

2296
03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:19.419
Orlando Sequera: developer, making the same house repeatedly as a predicted project. Well, where will the provision exist

2297
03:52:19.480 --> 03:52:24.700
Orlando Sequera: for this example? You can work with your stakeholders. How would you like to.

2298
03:52:25.120 --> 03:52:30.840
Orlando Sequera: You can ask your customers what type of house are you envisioning? I would like to have? That is

2299
03:52:30.910 --> 03:52:38.529
Orlando Sequera: that feels spacious with open areas. You can definitely apply it even in that situation. So

2300
03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:49.759
Orlando Sequera: try to get information from them to see what type of functionality they're looking for in the house, so it's perfectly possible to apply the per box to exercise, even in that context of field in the house.

2301
03:52:51.100 --> 03:52:53.629
Orlando Sequera: All right, let's continue with the content.

2302
03:52:56.910 --> 03:52:58.780
Orlando Sequera: Once we have

2303
03:52:59.280 --> 03:53:02.140
Orlando Sequera: everyone on the same page, and what we're trying

2304
03:53:02.470 --> 03:53:04.790
Orlando Sequera: and what we're trying to do with the project.

2305
03:53:05.280 --> 03:53:15.149
Orlando Sequera: Right, charter is in place. We're on the same page. We need to get started with our project, and that's what takes us to a kickoff meeting.

2306
03:53:15.340 --> 03:53:17.390
Orlando Sequera: We need to get everyone

2307
03:53:17.770 --> 03:53:22.510
Orlando Sequera: a ideally together, whether it is virtual, or in a conference room.

2308
03:53:22.680 --> 03:53:25.899
Orlando Sequera: And in this kickoff meeting we are going to

2309
03:53:26.670 --> 03:53:31.110
Orlando Sequera: be able to ensure alignment that we're all on the same page.

2310
03:53:31.440 --> 03:53:33.630
Orlando Sequera: It helps with the information.

2311
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:35.030
Orlando Sequera: and it helps

2312
03:53:35.100 --> 03:53:39.180
Orlando Sequera: in a very important aspect which is aligning your team members

2313
03:53:39.320 --> 03:53:45.449
Orlando Sequera: and your stakeholders with the project vision, and gives them the opportunity to

2314
03:53:45.760 --> 03:53:47.260
Orlando Sequera: provide their input

2315
03:53:47.600 --> 03:53:49.829
Orlando Sequera: and make sure that we are.

2316
03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:56.359
Orlando Sequera: or to validate the fact that we are indeed on the same page that is crucial for your project.

2317
03:53:56.590 --> 03:53:58.280
Orlando Sequera: This is where

2318
03:53:58.720 --> 03:54:00.750
Orlando Sequera: the project

2319
03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:04.029
Orlando Sequera: as an as an individual initiative. It's going to be

2320
03:54:04.460 --> 03:54:09.130
Orlando Sequera: to to the organization rest of the organization. He helps in

2321
03:54:09.310 --> 03:54:12.730
Orlando Sequera: getting a common understanding on that high level vision.

2322
03:54:12.810 --> 03:54:14.669
Orlando Sequera: purpose, and value of the project.

2323
03:54:15.130 --> 03:54:22.830
Orlando Sequera: We are able to identify those who are going to be the sponsor the key stakeholders and the project manager, and make sure that

2324
03:54:23.040 --> 03:54:24.949
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholders know who they are.

2325
03:54:25.290 --> 03:54:32.820
Orlando Sequera: And it includes high-level items from the project Charter. We're gonna use the bridge out for this kick off meeting.

2326
03:54:33.410 --> 03:54:35.109
Orlando Sequera: and

2327
03:54:35.820 --> 03:54:37.969
Orlando Sequera: internally we should

2328
03:54:38.410 --> 03:54:41.120
Orlando Sequera: review with the team the project charter.

2329
03:54:41.360 --> 03:54:48.969
Orlando Sequera: We should clarify the team member roles, and that's where we're going to create what is called a racy matrix.

2330
03:54:50.110 --> 03:54:51.360
Orlando Sequera: We have a list.

2331
03:54:51.460 --> 03:55:07.219
Orlando Sequera: a of the team members, and we're gonna define who needs to be who's gonna be responsible needs to complete the actual task? Who needs to be accountable, which is different from responsible accountable is the individual that has to make sure that the task

2332
03:55:07.240 --> 03:55:19.499
Orlando Sequera: gets done. Okay, not necessarily. The the responsible party has to do it, but the accountable party is the one that has to make sure that it gets done that. Ha! That is crucial, the Bracy matrix.

2333
03:55:19.620 --> 03:55:39.550
Orlando Sequera: Okay, then, this is where we're going to present some of the results of plan efforts. If we are following an adult approach, we are going to provide the initial version of the protocol, which is basically a running to do list of the functionality that has to be built in the project

2334
03:55:39.620 --> 03:55:41.320
Orlando Sequera: that's for adjunct projects

2335
03:55:41.570 --> 03:55:44.819
Orlando Sequera: A. Or if we're following a hybrid approach.

2336
03:55:45.480 --> 03:55:47.850
Orlando Sequera: this is where we present the product roadmap.

2337
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.740
Okay.

2338
03:55:50.190 --> 03:55:51.130
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2339
03:55:54.010 --> 03:56:01.629
Orlando Sequera: So far we have enabled we. We started talking about how to lead a team with a clear vision and mission.

2340
03:56:02.470 --> 03:56:06.160
Orlando Sequera: We also went over the bounds of negotiation for agreement.

2341
03:56:07.120 --> 03:56:13.259
Orlando Sequera: assessing we were assessing the priorities and determining the ultimate objectives of the project.

2342
03:56:13.500 --> 03:56:14.970
Orlando Sequera: We were also

2343
03:56:15.140 --> 03:56:17.380
Orlando Sequera: talking about a

2344
03:56:17.620 --> 03:56:28.879
Orlando Sequera: the need for participating in negotiations and being able to come up with a negotiation strategy. And this is the link between what we cover and your exam Content outline. Okay.

2345
03:56:29.310 --> 03:56:38.129
Orlando Sequera: then, we have. We talked about building share understanding. This is crucial. We need to get everyone on the same page, and by that I mean the project team members

2346
03:56:38.180 --> 03:56:39.130
Orlando Sequera: and

2347
03:56:39.200 --> 03:56:44.639
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholders. They need to be on the same page. And this is where we also need to

2348
03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:47.760
Orlando Sequera: it support the outcome of this agreement.

2349
03:56:48.180 --> 03:56:52.629
Orlando Sequera: and we also talked about defining the team ground rules communicating this

2350
03:56:52.770 --> 03:56:57.580
Orlando Sequera: principles with the team and external stakeholders, and then they need of

2351
03:56:57.690 --> 03:57:01.369
Orlando Sequera: an environment that Fosters collaboration and

2352
03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:04.859
Orlando Sequera: a proper following of those ground rules

2353
03:57:05.120 --> 03:57:07.509
Orlando Sequera: that we created as a team.

2354
03:57:07.680 --> 03:57:09.639
Orlando Sequera: Okay, super important.

2355
03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:11.779
Orlando Sequera: All right. Now.

2356
03:57:11.970 --> 03:57:12.990
Orlando Sequera: i'm going to go back.

2357
03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:14.899
Orlando Sequera: And and, sir.

2358
03:57:16.010 --> 03:57:18.140
Orlando Sequera: a few.

2359
03:57:19.020 --> 03:57:21.489
Orlando Sequera: please vote on those questions.

2360
03:57:22.120 --> 03:57:26.160
Orlando Sequera: and i'm going to start answering the questions by

2361
03:57:26.540 --> 03:57:29.220
Orlando Sequera: that have the most votes

2362
03:57:29.560 --> 03:57:32.300
Orlando Sequera: in case of some critical information

2363
03:57:32.890 --> 03:57:33.970
Orlando Sequera: changing

2364
03:57:34.170 --> 03:57:35.789
Orlando Sequera: such as the project

2365
03:57:35.860 --> 03:57:39.370
Orlando Sequera: sponsor changing, will the pressure be updated?

2366
03:57:41.180 --> 03:57:50.730
Orlando Sequera: You, don't, necessarily have to go back and change it. You can a update that in, because you by. If when that happens you're already gonna be in planning.

2367
03:57:50.940 --> 03:57:56.559
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So you don't need to go back and change it. That was the sponsor of that particular point in time that

2368
03:57:57.330 --> 03:57:59.470
Orlando Sequera: but what you have to update

2369
03:57:59.820 --> 03:58:08.320
Orlando Sequera: the and this is the right answer to that question. What you really have to update is not the project chatter? It will be your stakeholder register.

2370
03:58:08.680 --> 03:58:17.869
Orlando Sequera: So that is the question to that. That is the answer to that question. What you need to update in reality is the stakeholder register with a new sponsor, not the project. Charter

2371
03:58:18.150 --> 03:58:20.289
Orlando Sequera: per chatter was correct at that time

2372
03:58:20.770 --> 03:58:24.630
Orlando Sequera: snapshot of that time. What you have to update is your stakeholder register.

2373
03:58:25.310 --> 03:58:30.089
Orlando Sequera: If a project manager leaves right after Charter. But before the project

2374
03:58:30.340 --> 03:58:34.149
Orlando Sequera: actually begins. The the new primary need to review the pro chatter.

2375
03:58:34.460 --> 03:58:35.289
Orlando Sequera: of course.

2376
03:58:35.540 --> 03:58:36.580
Orlando Sequera: absolutely

2377
03:58:42.500 --> 03:58:43.630
Orlando Sequera: absolutely

2378
03:58:44.250 --> 03:58:51.030
Orlando Sequera: any new project. If you're assigned that you're assigned to review the you have to review the pro charter. Yes.

2379
03:58:52.380 --> 03:58:55.960
Orlando Sequera: given all this, there's another question Given

2380
03:58:56.070 --> 03:59:01.010
Orlando Sequera: all these requirements. Criteria for planning and starting projects. Is it common?

2381
03:59:06.910 --> 03:59:08.199
I'm: sorry

2382
03:59:14.880 --> 03:59:15.930
it's done.

2383
03:59:21.010 --> 03:59:21.780
Hmm.

2384
03:59:23.020 --> 03:59:32.770
Orlando Sequera: My apologies. The questions are okay. I found it Given all these requirements: criteria for planning and starting price to come up for a single Pm: be responsible for multiple projects. At the same time

2385
03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:36.400
Orlando Sequera: it happens, yeah. So welcome to project management.

2386
03:59:36.430 --> 03:59:40.379
Orlando Sequera: That's my best answer. Welcome to project management.

2387
03:59:41.160 --> 03:59:43.180
Orlando Sequera: So Yes, it can happen in some

2388
03:59:43.310 --> 03:59:45.550
Orlando Sequera: in in some cases.

2389
03:59:45.900 --> 03:59:47.840
Orlando Sequera: but you get better at it

2390
03:59:50.020 --> 04:00:01.910
Orlando Sequera: all right as a Pm. If commitments are needed in the charter, you'd have to go back and change it. It's created that particular time when the project starts you don't have to go back and change it.

2391
04:00:01.920 --> 04:00:10.129
Orlando Sequera: You have to change other artifacts like the stakeholder register like your race, Register not the project, Charter. You don't have to go back and change it.

2392
04:00:14.730 --> 04:00:19.849
Orlando Sequera: Another question at this point in Project Preparation Project Charter, You said

2393
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:27.230
Orlando Sequera: that this was the start. This happens at the beginning of every project. Yes. Is this the only document that has been created

2394
04:00:27.860 --> 04:00:29.380
Orlando Sequera: is the risk register.

2395
04:00:29.460 --> 04:00:37.980
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder, register, and our previous mentioned document. Not you like. They are utilized formally, but they're They're determined. They do start working.

2396
04:00:38.130 --> 04:00:40.969
Orlando Sequera: What happens? The 2 processes

2397
04:00:41.260 --> 04:00:44.290
Orlando Sequera: key processes that happen in the start of any project

2398
04:00:44.390 --> 04:00:46.379
Orlando Sequera: that happens simultaneously.

2399
04:00:46.900 --> 04:00:55.720
Orlando Sequera: Development the product, charter and stakeholder identification. But Don't look at it sequentially, Don't. Look at it sequentially. This happens.

2400
04:00:55.860 --> 04:01:05.099
Orlando Sequera: is simultaneously the same time that you are this: the the the prior is being developed. You are working on identifying stakeholders as well.

2401
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:07.670
Orlando Sequera: Not all of them are sequential.

2402
04:01:14.650 --> 04:01:17.170
Okay.

2403
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:29.570
Orlando Sequera: there's another question in the chat and the Q. A. I'm: Sorry not the chat. How did you deal with organizational norms?

2404
04:01:32.910 --> 04:01:34.730
I'm: Sorry. Keeps growing.

2405
04:01:42.360 --> 04:01:43.539
Orlando Sequera: Hmm. Okay.

2406
04:01:43.570 --> 04:01:46.460
Orlando Sequera: These 2 went up. So i'm going to start with these 2 questions.

2407
04:01:46.530 --> 04:01:51.740
Orlando Sequera: What material should be presented on kickoff, and what material should be sent before the meeting.

2408
04:01:52.090 --> 04:01:54.550
Orlando Sequera: The charter should be sent before the meeting.

2409
04:01:54.630 --> 04:01:56.170
Orlando Sequera: Let me go back to that slide.

2410
04:01:57.430 --> 04:02:01.309
Orlando Sequera: and the racing should be for the team internally.

2411
04:02:04.040 --> 04:02:13.390
Orlando Sequera: and the Charter so should be sent before the meeting before the kick off meeting. So give people a chance to review it and then provide their input. So

2412
04:02:13.630 --> 04:02:14.840
Orlando Sequera: the charter

2413
04:02:14.930 --> 04:02:20.210
Orlando Sequera: with stakeholders and the team, and then the racy with the team members.

2414
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:25.019
Orlando Sequera: It's a racy shone during kickoff meeting.

2415
04:02:26.050 --> 04:02:32.629
Orlando Sequera: There's not a hard role to say No, but that's more for the team, mostly for the team.

2416
04:02:33.470 --> 04:02:36.500
Orlando Sequera: That's what's going to help you to avoid a lot of conflict.

2417
04:02:36.620 --> 04:02:41.049
Orlando Sequera: because many that's one of the main sources of conflict.

2418
04:02:41.160 --> 04:02:42.940
Orlando Sequera: we not.

2419
04:02:43.020 --> 04:02:47.689
Orlando Sequera: when you don't, have clarity about the roles of responsibilities. That's why that's important.

2420
04:02:49.420 --> 04:02:50.320
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2421
04:02:51.060 --> 04:02:53.420
Orlando Sequera: So we answered those 2.

2422
04:02:56.960 --> 04:03:15.230
Orlando Sequera: How do you deal with organizational norms and external stakeholders in the kickoff meeting? Well, by understanding those review and opa. Every organization is different. You need to know those organizational North and adjust to them. Get support from the Pmo. And if there's not a pmo in place. Talk to other project managers, but

2423
04:03:15.240 --> 04:03:18.389
Orlando Sequera: get some help If you're new to the organization, get some help.

2424
04:03:23.520 --> 04:03:30.670
Orlando Sequera: Can acceptance. Criterion definition of of Don't be applicable in predictive or waterfall

2425
04:03:31.400 --> 04:03:34.729
Orlando Sequera: acceptance. Criteria? Yes, definitely, should have done no

2426
04:03:43.200 --> 04:03:51.499
Orlando Sequera: another question at this point in preparation you said that it was the start. Yes, it's the only document that has been created.

2427
04:03:51.770 --> 04:04:01.019
Orlando Sequera: The rest register has some increase. Stakeholder register is in the process of being created because you are working simultaneously in developing the project charter, and also

2428
04:04:01.140 --> 04:04:05.379
Orlando Sequera: there a identifying your stakeholder choice in the process of being created.

2429
04:04:05.400 --> 04:04:08.970
Orlando Sequera: But all the documents that we use here that we

2430
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:12.230
Orlando Sequera: create. The artifacts are formally used.

2431
04:04:13.700 --> 04:04:15.180
Orlando Sequera: but some of them are

2432
04:04:15.360 --> 04:04:16.720
Orlando Sequera: done later.

2433
04:04:18.940 --> 04:04:19.610
Orlando Sequera: Oh!

2434
04:04:20.960 --> 04:04:24.149
Orlando Sequera: Can accept the script in the future, I answered that one already

2435
04:04:26.390 --> 04:04:37.530
Orlando Sequera: confirming that both agile and pretty, have the same general charter enemies. They don't the the agile project Charter is a little bit less. It's. It's a little bit more lightweight, less elements compared to

2436
04:04:38.680 --> 04:04:39.810
Orlando Sequera: the

2437
04:04:40.120 --> 04:04:43.229
Orlando Sequera: to a project charter for a predictive

2438
04:04:44.300 --> 04:04:45.210
Orlando Sequera: approach.

2439
04:04:47.980 --> 04:04:55.039
Orlando Sequera: There's another question. Difference between project, mandate and for each other. I do not know what project mandate is, so I do not know.

2440
04:04:55.340 --> 04:05:01.229
Orlando Sequera: but I can tell you that that's not part of the terminology that you need to know for your Pmp. Exam.

2441
04:05:01.360 --> 04:05:02.140
So

2442
04:05:04.450 --> 04:05:10.380
Orlando Sequera: another question scope on the project. China has not been discussed with the team.

2443
04:05:10.560 --> 04:05:23.330
Orlando Sequera: Correct. That's why we only have. But we have a high-level idea of the scope. That's what goes in the project. Charter that's Why, we don't have to go back and change the procedure. We have to

2444
04:05:23.480 --> 04:05:30.990
Orlando Sequera: define this call for a project. Okay, that's gonna happen later. In planning. This is just the starting point.

2445
04:05:31.190 --> 04:05:35.669
Orlando Sequera: just a starting point. We we haven't been able to define this code.

2446
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:38.579
Orlando Sequera: So that's a true thing that will happen later.

2447
04:05:40.220 --> 04:05:58.470
Orlando Sequera: Another question that's the pretty charter include the budget. It includes high level information about the budget. We think that this is gonna cost a 1 million dollars. We're going to need a 1 million dollars. But do, how do we have. It's just then high level assumption that we're making at that point based on previous projects.

2448
04:05:58.480 --> 04:06:02.180
Orlando Sequera: Possibly. But we need to work on planning

2449
04:06:02.400 --> 04:06:04.700
Orlando Sequera: in order to determine the budget

2450
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:09.340
Orlando Sequera: for our project. So it's high level information about the budget only

2451
04:06:12.250 --> 04:06:15.210
Orlando Sequera: will all stakeholders should be part of the kickoff meeting.

2452
04:06:16.570 --> 04:06:22.329
Orlando Sequera: Ideally, you should get as many as possible, especially the key stakeholders that should be present.

2453
04:06:25.120 --> 04:06:26.310
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2454
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:35.310
Orlando Sequera: when you are assigned to a project that is already underway. But it's not going well. How would you approach this

2455
04:06:38.300 --> 04:06:39.110
Orlando Sequera: cedar

2456
04:06:39.220 --> 04:06:40.460
Orlando Sequera: That happens?

2457
04:06:41.770 --> 04:06:48.260
Orlando Sequera: What would you do? A midpoint Kick off and try to realize? Well, you have to understand.

2458
04:06:48.460 --> 04:06:53.900
Orlando Sequera: not really not necessarily. Not about a kickoff that already happened. Right? The project is already

2459
04:06:54.000 --> 04:07:00.989
Orlando Sequera: under way. So what you really have to do is try to understand what are your first?

2460
04:07:01.140 --> 04:07:02.330
Orlando Sequera: It

2461
04:07:02.760 --> 04:07:06.020
Orlando Sequera: tasks should be. Try to understand

2462
04:07:07.140 --> 04:07:09.930
Orlando Sequera: the province that you're facing? Is the project.

2463
04:07:11.930 --> 04:07:20.789
Orlando Sequera: Is it about cost overrun, or are you or the schedule. Are you having scheduled? Promise? So it's it's the kickoff is pretty much

2464
04:07:20.800 --> 04:07:32.309
Orlando Sequera: relevant, is you gotta get up to speed about the promise that you're facing, so you can come up with the with with a strategy to address those issues that the project is facing it's way beyond

2465
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:39.300
Orlando Sequera: having. You don't need to have another kick off. You need to understand what the what are the problems that your project that your project is facing, that's

2466
04:07:39.500 --> 04:07:42.340
Orlando Sequera: It's it's already too late for a kickoff.

2467
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:48.839
Orlando Sequera: Another question. When do you? Okay?

2468
04:07:49.020 --> 04:07:50.780
Orlando Sequera: I answer that

2469
04:07:51.440 --> 04:07:55.370
Orlando Sequera: e is the price chatter in addition to the provision.

2470
04:07:55.890 --> 04:07:57.789
Orlando Sequera: Yes, it

2471
04:07:57.850 --> 04:08:04.489
Orlando Sequera: It is like the written word version of the vision. It it in with a little bit more detail. Yes, you are correct. You are correct.

2472
04:08:06.140 --> 04:08:18.530
Orlando Sequera: Okay? A little bit more question another question. The project cost budget. Another financial could be confidential, and the client might not want it to be in the pressure. That's not the case. This is not the project.

2473
04:08:18.760 --> 04:08:23.870
Orlando Sequera: the final project budget you have to the You're going to develop that later in

2474
04:08:23.960 --> 04:08:30.429
Orlando Sequera: the actual, in your planning efforts. This is just the high level overview of

2475
04:08:30.440 --> 04:08:44.289
Orlando Sequera: the product of the project project. But it's not the final budget. So you're mixing a couple of things that are not related. This is a starting point. We think that this is going to cost a 1 million dollars. It's just high level information. What you have in the project, charter.

2476
04:08:45.140 --> 04:08:51.160
Orlando Sequera: So no need. That's later. When you develop the project button and we're going to talk about that. But not here.

2477
04:08:53.600 --> 04:08:57.580
Orlando Sequera: can accept the script and definition of on be applicable to waterfall, approach

2478
04:08:57.610 --> 04:09:06.809
Orlando Sequera: acceptance, criteria? Yes, because is specific to requirements, but not definition of done. That's only we use that only for agile

2479
04:09:08.110 --> 04:09:11.420
Orlando Sequera: and for the kickoff meeting

2480
04:09:11.980 --> 04:09:16.409
Orlando Sequera: can these over will be used as a general outline for the agenda. Yes.

2481
04:09:21.760 --> 04:09:38.679
Orlando Sequera: another question. So even if the press cup changes along the way. You do not change the pro charter. Yes, correct. You're absolutely correct. You don't have to go back and change it. That is the starting point what we mute at the start of the project. We don't need to go back and change it. You don't go back in time and change your

2482
04:09:38.730 --> 04:09:43.719
Orlando Sequera: birth certificate, at least not in this country. So same principle here, right.

2483
04:09:49.410 --> 04:09:53.219
Orlando Sequera: Are there any differences between

2484
04:09:55.470 --> 04:09:56.490
Orlando Sequera: oh, one

2485
04:09:57.020 --> 04:10:05.249
Orlando Sequera: one and versus a ventilment project? I do not know what you. I do not know what our name stands for. I need more context.

2486
04:10:06.180 --> 04:10:07.539
Orlando Sequera: A.

2487
04:10:08.140 --> 04:10:09.700
Orlando Sequera: There's another question in the chat.

2488
04:10:09.810 --> 04:10:11.410
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that is being oppressed

2489
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:14.820
Orlando Sequera: communication work is from

2490
04:10:14.930 --> 04:10:17.039
Orlando Sequera: it. Works in Amy approach.

2491
04:10:17.380 --> 04:10:19.600
Orlando Sequera: All right, so I think we have

2492
04:10:23.170 --> 04:10:29.090
Orlando Sequera: being able to address most of the questions we're going to continue with the content.

2493
04:10:29.410 --> 04:10:30.710
Orlando Sequera: And

2494
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:33.889
Orlando Sequera: but before that we're going to take our break.

2495
04:10:34.340 --> 04:10:40.250
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so we're ready for a first break. We're doing great. Thank you so much, everyone for following instructions.

2496
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:44.480
Orlando Sequera: and we're gonna take a 10 min break and we will be back in

2497
04:10:44.660 --> 04:10:45.740
Orlando Sequera: 10 min.

2498
04:10:45.760 --> 04:10:47.599
Orlando Sequera: Enjoy your break, everyone.

2499
04:11:11.550 --> 04:11:13.260
Orlando Sequera: We're going to come up with that

2500
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:18.490
Orlando Sequera: and my apologies. Thank you. So we can

2501
04:11:19.540 --> 04:11:30.889
Orlando Sequera: a measure the priorities and determine the ultimate objectives, participate in agreement negotiations, and come up with a strategy for those negotiations right with the team and also with the stakeholders.

2502
04:11:32.160 --> 04:11:39.809
Orlando Sequera: build that share understanding, getting everyone on the same page. This is where we come up with a project vision and the project Charter.

2503
04:11:41.000 --> 04:11:42.970
Orlando Sequera: get every all.

2504
04:11:43.000 --> 04:11:55.950
Orlando Sequera: Get all the parties in a posture to reach consensus, and then they find the team ground rules communicate those principles with the team and the external stakeholders.

2505
04:11:56.080 --> 04:12:00.250
Orlando Sequera: and then fostering environment that

2506
04:12:01.100 --> 04:12:04.589
Orlando Sequera: helps in those ground rules to come to fruition.

2507
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:06.119
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that's

2508
04:12:06.260 --> 04:12:09.940
Orlando Sequera: kind of what we cover. We talked about the project. Charter.

2509
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:25.119
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna mention that one more time. This is probably one of the few artifacts that we create, if if not to say the only one that we don't have to go back and change once that that's one big takeaway that I want you to remember

2510
04:12:25.390 --> 04:12:28.970
Orlando Sequera: the project. Charter is created at the start of the project.

2511
04:12:29.460 --> 04:12:41.580
Orlando Sequera: It is the birth certificate of your project. It has high level information, but all the different areas of the program about the budget. But it's just high level information with what we know

2512
04:12:42.440 --> 04:12:43.670
Orlando Sequera: at that moment

2513
04:12:44.340 --> 04:12:52.060
Orlando Sequera: has high level information about the schedule, mostly about milestones. A milestone is a significant event in your project.

2514
04:12:52.150 --> 04:12:57.839
Orlando Sequera: so you can have a a milestone summary in the for the charter.

2515
04:12:57.860 --> 04:13:05.719
Orlando Sequera: It has high level information about the scope of the project. High level information about the stakeholders high level information about risk

2516
04:13:05.740 --> 04:13:13.090
Orlando Sequera: so multiple different areas of our projects, but it's just high level information 50 50,000 feet view

2517
04:13:13.150 --> 04:13:16.069
Orlando Sequera: of those different areas of our project, but

2518
04:13:16.220 --> 04:13:22.080
Orlando Sequera: it's just a green light that gives us the authority as a project manager to start working on

2519
04:13:22.160 --> 04:13:35.950
Orlando Sequera: planning activities. And then we're going to do a deeper dive. Then we're going to work with our team members, and they find the scope of the project. Understand the requirements and define the scope of our project. And we're following a predictive approach.

2520
04:13:36.620 --> 04:13:41.869
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna start working on the budget. We're gonna start working on the schedule. We have to

2521
04:13:41.880 --> 04:14:01.700
Orlando Sequera: it. We we have to follow those planning processes in order to really develop the budget of our project the schedule of our project, and have a better understanding of what we're trying to do. Which is this cope of our project. We have to work on risk. We have to work on communication. We have to a work with

2522
04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:08.289
Orlando Sequera: our stakeholders, which is something that also happens at the very beginning. But that's what happens At the beginning. We start

2523
04:14:08.460 --> 04:14:15.569
Orlando Sequera: working, developing the product charter, helping our our sponsors sponsor to the veil of the pro charter in.

2524
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:35.269
Orlando Sequera: We start working in identifying our stakeholders. So sort of 2 key things that happen at the very beginning of any project. Okay. But then we have to expand and really get more detail and granular in all those different areas that I just mentioned. You Don't, have to go back to change the the project Charter.

2525
04:14:35.280 --> 04:14:47.969
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and for those of you that had those questions you don't need to go back and change. Oh, I was assigned to a project in the middle middle of execution. Do I have to go back and have a kickoff meeting and

2526
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:51.660
Orlando Sequera: and change it for each other? No, you are

2527
04:14:51.730 --> 04:15:10.550
Orlando Sequera: The most important task at that moment is to understand what are the challenges that your project is facing, and get up to speed about that about the scope. Who the stakeholders are, etc., as quickly as possible, to start coming up with a with a game plan, with a strategy to address those challenges that so do you have to do. You need to go back and do

2528
04:15:10.560 --> 04:15:12.430
Orlando Sequera: change it for a charter that

2529
04:15:12.750 --> 04:15:31.780
Orlando Sequera: that that is the past. That was va relevant information in the past. What about my sponsor change? Do I have to go back and change it to the church? No, you don't. You have to change your stakeholder register, that is, and a a living document, a document that is always changing. That's what you have to change. Not the project, Charter. That was true to that moment.

2530
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:40.339
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So you don't have to go back in time to change the birth to the birth certificate of your project. Please remember that for

2531
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:41.720
Orlando Sequera: for the exempt

2532
04:15:41.890 --> 04:15:42.770
Orlando Sequera: alright

2533
04:15:45.200 --> 04:15:46.660
we

2534
04:15:49.350 --> 04:15:52.100
Orlando Sequera: now we're going to talk about the project approach.

2535
04:15:54.490 --> 04:15:56.069
Orlando Sequera: That's our next topic.

2536
04:15:57.300 --> 04:16:02.660
Orlando Sequera: And but before before we do that, it it is important to understand

2537
04:16:02.820 --> 04:16:06.110
Orlando Sequera: and how and why approaches are different.

2538
04:16:09.190 --> 04:16:14.670
Orlando Sequera: While in the predictive project life site. Well, the predictive for a life cycle has been effective

2539
04:16:14.780 --> 04:16:17.050
Orlando Sequera: in supporting project management

2540
04:16:17.210 --> 04:16:21.549
Orlando Sequera: for many, many years over 50 years, and this was

2541
04:16:21.760 --> 04:16:33.459
Orlando Sequera: this was the common norm for organizations. For more than 50 years they were following a predictive approach, and that was working project. Management is

2542
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:35.320
Orlando Sequera: rapidly changing.

2543
04:16:35.540 --> 04:16:36.539
Orlando Sequera: A

2544
04:16:36.680 --> 04:16:38.070
Orlando Sequera: organizations

2545
04:16:38.400 --> 04:16:41.859
Orlando Sequera: requirements are changing and evolving, and

2546
04:16:42.120 --> 04:16:43.039
Orlando Sequera: this

2547
04:16:43.180 --> 04:16:49.930
Orlando Sequera: process based orientation of the of the predictive approach is very prescriptive.

2548
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:52.739
Orlando Sequera: and by that I mean

2549
04:16:54.020 --> 04:17:00.569
Orlando Sequera: they their their prescription. They tell you step by step, what you need to do. That is one of the

2550
04:17:00.810 --> 04:17:12.149
Orlando Sequera: aspects. I'm not gonna say limitations because it's not really a limitations. That one is the one of the characteristics of the predictive life cycle approach. It's very prescriptive, telling you

2551
04:17:12.370 --> 04:17:15.819
Orlando Sequera: step by step, what to do. Think of it as

2552
04:17:15.940 --> 04:17:31.789
Orlando Sequera: as a recipe whenever you're trying to cook a meal. What do you do? Probably most of you are like me, you you're trying to cook Lasagna for the first time you go and Google a recipe for Lasagna, and then you get a your recipe gives you, step by step.

2553
04:17:32.280 --> 04:17:34.730
Orlando Sequera: all the different

2554
04:17:35.230 --> 04:17:39.609
Orlando Sequera: it gives you, step by step the activities that you have to follow right in order to

2555
04:17:40.060 --> 04:17:44.000
Orlando Sequera: ideally be able to cook a nice lasagna. So

2556
04:17:44.660 --> 04:17:47.739
Orlando Sequera: that is the prescriptive that is being prescriptive.

2557
04:17:48.150 --> 04:17:55.119
Orlando Sequera: That is, the challenge with current environments in which change is a constant.

2558
04:17:56.090 --> 04:17:58.680
Orlando Sequera: The environments are becoming more and more complex.

2559
04:17:59.040 --> 04:18:07.060
Orlando Sequera: The organizations are becoming more and more complex, and a prescriptive approach is not always going to cut it.

2560
04:18:07.230 --> 04:18:09.410
Orlando Sequera: It's not always going to

2561
04:18:10.250 --> 04:18:12.859
Orlando Sequera: to be the best approach.

2562
04:18:12.920 --> 04:18:27.830
Orlando Sequera: say i'm not saying that it's no longer the case in some industries, in some situations. That's what's going to be the most effective way of doing things in construction. If we go back and we're building the the house.

2563
04:18:27.880 --> 04:18:34.030
Orlando Sequera: you can define the entire scope. You can understand your You can define your scope for your house

2564
04:18:34.140 --> 04:18:50.509
Orlando Sequera: and work on that, and create your plans, and then track your performance against your plans and make adjustments as needed. And that's gonna work really? Well, it works really well in construction. Okay, in that aspect of the construction. Industry works really well.

2565
04:18:50.520 --> 04:18:57.719
Orlando Sequera: but in some other industries not so much because, as we see here, the level of complexity is changing.

2566
04:18:58.010 --> 04:19:01.390
Orlando Sequera: There's constantly global change. And that

2567
04:19:02.480 --> 04:19:21.579
Orlando Sequera: that was basically the ask for a different approach. That was a little bit less rigid and more flexible, that allowed a organizations to conduct the projects in a different way to account for that complexity that actually translates to changes.

2568
04:19:21.640 --> 04:19:26.250
Orlando Sequera: That's where the adaptive agent approach came up. Okay.

2569
04:19:26.930 --> 04:19:27.850
Orlando Sequera: So

2570
04:19:28.300 --> 04:19:35.930
Orlando Sequera: that's that's why that's what makes the big difference between a predictive approach and an agile approach

2571
04:19:36.220 --> 04:19:48.379
Orlando Sequera: predictive. It's very prescriptive. They give you a list of steps that you have to follow, and that's what you have to do, whatever that you have more flexibility. There's not one single way of doing it right. It's just a framework. They give you tools.

2572
04:19:48.450 --> 04:19:55.149
Orlando Sequera: and they give you a framework that is flexible enough that you can implement and tailor to your specific situation.

2573
04:19:55.570 --> 04:19:56.460
Orlando Sequera: And

2574
04:19:56.960 --> 04:19:59.720
Orlando Sequera: that's a nice set way to our

2575
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:03.780
Orlando Sequera: next topic. So

2576
04:20:05.160 --> 04:20:16.310
Orlando Sequera: Taylor, product manager and approaches are gonna help us to support dynamic work environments and that dynamic working virus. That means that they're changing dynamic. They're constantly changing.

2577
04:20:16.560 --> 04:20:19.719
Orlando Sequera: We need to have an approach that is going to help us to

2578
04:20:20.100 --> 04:20:21.390
Orlando Sequera: a

2579
04:20:21.720 --> 04:20:26.740
Orlando Sequera: discover and determine value, deliver requirements as early as possible.

2580
04:20:26.860 --> 04:20:28.229
Orlando Sequera: and also

2581
04:20:28.620 --> 04:20:29.879
Orlando Sequera: we need an approach

2582
04:20:30.060 --> 04:20:34.990
Orlando Sequera: that helps us to put stakeholders on the team in close collaboration

2583
04:20:35.620 --> 04:20:39.240
Orlando Sequera: that happens in agile. That happens in agile.

2584
04:20:39.730 --> 04:20:41.570
Orlando Sequera: What are some of the advantages?

2585
04:20:41.780 --> 04:20:43.550
Orlando Sequera: It gives us? A better.

2586
04:20:44.260 --> 04:20:54.339
Orlando Sequera: better telemetry when it comes to feature or capability, assessment, and through continuous improvement and quality, and it also helps with

2587
04:20:54.420 --> 04:20:57.270
Orlando Sequera: organizational tolerance for changes.

2588
04:20:57.520 --> 04:20:58.160
Yeah.

2589
04:20:58.220 --> 04:21:10.300
Orlando Sequera: And remember, if several leaders they're going to influence projects and encourage the organization to think differently, because it's also about the mindset. When it comes to agile, it's not

2590
04:21:10.660 --> 04:21:14.739
Orlando Sequera: doing agile is about being agile, and that involves

2591
04:21:15.010 --> 04:21:18.930
Orlando Sequera: changing the mindset. So servant leaders are going to influence

2592
04:21:19.150 --> 04:21:22.210
Orlando Sequera: projects, and they're going to encourage your organization

2593
04:21:22.370 --> 04:21:26.990
Orlando Sequera: to think different and adopt the new agile mindset.

2594
04:21:27.260 --> 04:21:28.839
Orlando Sequera: All right, so that

2595
04:21:29.400 --> 04:21:32.949
Orlando Sequera: that those are some characteristics of that

2596
04:21:33.300 --> 04:21:34.679
Orlando Sequera: adaptive approach.

2597
04:21:39.420 --> 04:21:41.090
Orlando Sequera: And here we have

2598
04:21:41.200 --> 04:21:43.440
Orlando Sequera: the different approaches. Again.

2599
04:21:45.820 --> 04:21:46.800
Orlando Sequera: Experience.

2600
04:21:47.100 --> 04:21:51.850
Orlando Sequera: managers, or project professionals are going to choose the best development

2601
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:53.479
Orlando Sequera: for their projects.

2602
04:21:54.570 --> 04:22:02.020
Orlando Sequera: It depends on the resources that they have. The understanding of the projects of the project scope

2603
04:22:03.230 --> 04:22:05.350
Orlando Sequera: the type of scope that we're working with

2604
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:10.899
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholders, the industry and many other factors. Right? So you have the

2605
04:22:11.010 --> 04:22:15.689
Orlando Sequera: ideally you should have the freedom. You should have the flexibility to

2606
04:22:16.340 --> 04:22:30.560
Orlando Sequera: choose the best approach for your project. Are we going to go with an agile approach? Are we going to go with a predictive approach, or are we going to go with a hybrid with a combination of the 2 with a hybrid approach.

2607
04:22:30.640 --> 04:22:31.510
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2608
04:22:31.800 --> 04:22:32.510
Orlando Sequera: So

2609
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:38.570
Orlando Sequera: let's start talking about the predictive approach. Predictive equals

2610
04:22:39.530 --> 04:22:42.189
Orlando Sequera: traditional equals waterfall.

2611
04:22:42.570 --> 04:22:43.910
Orlando Sequera: any other 3.

2612
04:22:44.190 --> 04:22:47.189
Orlando Sequera: That's it's the same right. It's the same

2613
04:22:47.270 --> 04:22:50.719
Orlando Sequera: or plan driven. That's another

2614
04:22:50.770 --> 04:22:54.019
Orlando Sequera: way to call that the predictive approach.

2615
04:22:55.030 --> 04:23:14.200
Orlando Sequera: It is a highly reliable approach to project manager to project management in which the project needs the requirements, and constraints and constraints are understood. At the beginning of the project. We define the scope. We define the budget for a project at the beginning in planning.

2616
04:23:14.380 --> 04:23:16.469
Orlando Sequera: and then we start

2617
04:23:17.180 --> 04:23:25.679
Orlando Sequera: execution. We start working on a project, and what we do is compare our performance to the plans

2618
04:23:25.870 --> 04:23:28.040
Orlando Sequera: in a predictive approach.

2619
04:23:28.780 --> 04:23:30.210
Orlando Sequera: The plans

2620
04:23:30.360 --> 04:23:33.380
Orlando Sequera: are the ones that drive the project forward.

2621
04:23:33.790 --> 04:23:43.259
Orlando Sequera: We measure the performance comparing what actually happens in the project. That's what we call actuals. And when we cover and value manager, and it's gonna make more sense.

2622
04:23:43.310 --> 04:23:49.740
Orlando Sequera: But those are actual. What actually happens in the project compared to what we say

2623
04:23:49.810 --> 04:23:53.159
Orlando Sequera: that we were going to be do. That's what that's Those are the plans

2624
04:23:53.380 --> 04:23:59.169
Orlando Sequera: all right, but the plans drive the project forward. That's what we call it. Plan driven

2625
04:23:59.300 --> 04:24:07.969
Orlando Sequera: A. The more well planned our project is, the more predictive and control the project is

2626
04:24:08.530 --> 04:24:09.570
Orlando Sequera: change.

2627
04:24:10.100 --> 04:24:20.139
Orlando Sequera: You might be wondering is change possible in a predictive project. Yes, it is, but it has to be done in a control way. We use

2628
04:24:21.140 --> 04:24:25.440
Orlando Sequera: change control management for predictive

2629
04:24:25.600 --> 04:24:27.190
approaches.

2630
04:24:27.390 --> 04:24:37.420
Orlando Sequera: and this starts with a change control board, which is an entity that is formed by experts and upper management. They are going to be making decisions.

2631
04:24:37.800 --> 04:24:43.869
Orlando Sequera: evaluating those changes, and they're gonna about. What are they going to evaluate any proposed change

2632
04:24:44.350 --> 04:24:53.650
Orlando Sequera: that is going to start with the creation of something that we call a change Request. This change Request gets routed to the Change Control Board.

2633
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:57.220
Orlando Sequera: and this change control port. So I mentioned before it's a.

2634
04:24:57.240 --> 04:24:59.220
Orlando Sequera: It's an entity that is formed by

2635
04:24:59.260 --> 04:25:02.920
Orlando Sequera: subject matter. Experts in upper management.

2636
04:25:03.880 --> 04:25:19.270
Orlando Sequera: and what they're going to evaluate is the impact of those changes to the project. But the impact on what? The impact on the schedule, the impact on the scope and the impact on the budget, and they're going to make a determination if they approve of change, those change requests.

2637
04:25:19.290 --> 04:25:28.970
Orlando Sequera: That means that the changes have to be incorporated, and we have to a. If we are adding scope, we have to

2638
04:25:29.250 --> 04:25:31.770
Orlando Sequera: at the scope as needed in

2639
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:35.020
Orlando Sequera: really re- baseline our

2640
04:25:36.780 --> 04:25:42.229
Orlando Sequera: schedule and re based on our budget as needed that's how we incorporate the change

2641
04:25:42.260 --> 04:25:46.169
Orlando Sequera: A to our project that's how we do it. In

2642
04:25:46.490 --> 04:25:48.340
Orlando Sequera: in a predictive approach.

2643
04:25:48.620 --> 04:25:51.680
Orlando Sequera: The risks are also. We work

2644
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:56.180
Orlando Sequera: thoroughly in identifying risks, in having a solid and

2645
04:25:56.240 --> 04:26:13.349
Orlando Sequera: a solid risk register with those risks analyzed with responses identify for them, and risk owners identify for those risks. So that's how we do things in a in following a predictive approach.

2646
04:26:13.360 --> 04:26:17.349
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to certainty about requirements that has to do with scope.

2647
04:26:17.980 --> 04:26:26.150
Orlando Sequera: we define the scope at the beginning. Okay, the scope is fixed. It's only going to change through a change control process.

2648
04:26:26.910 --> 04:26:28.620
Orlando Sequera: scope the budget.

2649
04:26:29.010 --> 04:26:32.300
Orlando Sequera: and they and the schedule of a project. Actually.

2650
04:26:33.260 --> 04:26:38.459
Orlando Sequera: so we have a high certainty because we define the scope of for for a project.

2651
04:26:38.620 --> 04:26:39.410
Orlando Sequera: But

2652
04:26:39.690 --> 04:26:46.260
Orlando Sequera: if we're following an adaptive approach, which is better for situations in which we're dealing with high complexity.

2653
04:26:46.480 --> 04:26:55.539
Orlando Sequera: Again, we are developing a new technology for a rocket engines to to go to Mars, and if and beyond

2654
04:26:55.940 --> 04:26:58.820
Orlando Sequera: something that hasn't been done before that, it's very complex.

2655
04:26:59.240 --> 04:27:03.630
Orlando Sequera: We know where we want to go. We want to develop that new technology. How do we do it?

2656
04:27:04.390 --> 04:27:12.699
Orlando Sequera: That's the part that we don't know we know where we're going. The end goal, but we don't know how to do it. That means change

2657
04:27:13.040 --> 04:27:22.809
Orlando Sequera: or another example. It happens a lot with the development of mobile apps. For example, we're trying to come up with a new

2658
04:27:23.470 --> 04:27:25.830
Orlando Sequera: streaming service to compete with Netflix.

2659
04:27:25.860 --> 04:27:26.920
Orlando Sequera: for example.

2660
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:41.179
Orlando Sequera: and we know where we're going. But how do we do it? We we have to take into account changing customer preferences. So we start by evaluating customer preference out there that are changing all the time. So that's a lot of change.

2661
04:27:41.210 --> 04:27:54.149
Orlando Sequera: So if you're working with the scope, that is the first aspect that you have to look at scope of your project. If the scope is right off the bat, you know that the scope is going to be changing a lot.

2662
04:27:54.330 --> 04:28:07.909
Orlando Sequera: That's key. That's a key word. That's a hint for an adaptive, a approach. Why is that? Because an adaptive approach or a module approach is going to help? Is change driven changes

2663
04:28:08.040 --> 04:28:08.949
Orlando Sequera: our

2664
04:28:09.040 --> 04:28:09.840
Orlando Sequera: the

2665
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:13.210
Orlando Sequera: the the driving force in

2666
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:25.440
Orlando Sequera: changes, the driving force in an adaptive approach. The goal is to add value to the customer. Change is allowed at any time at any time. The goal that we have we agile with agile is to

2667
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:35.990
Orlando Sequera: add as much value as possible to our, to our stakeholders, to our, to our customers. Basically and the way we do it is in iterations.

2668
04:28:36.760 --> 04:28:40.379
Orlando Sequera: We do. We develop functionality, one piece at a time.

2669
04:28:40.640 --> 04:28:44.089
Orlando Sequera: multiple iterations over time when we build

2670
04:28:44.140 --> 04:28:45.949
Orlando Sequera: pieces of functionality.

2671
04:28:46.620 --> 04:28:50.460
Orlando Sequera: One iteration at a time. That's what we mean in

2672
04:28:50.530 --> 04:28:53.280
Orlando Sequera: an incremental development. Okay.

2673
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:58.250
Orlando Sequera: And we use a time box cadence. That's what we call iteration

2674
04:28:58.370 --> 04:29:01.619
Orlando Sequera: or spring in agile in in scrum

2675
04:29:01.770 --> 04:29:03.550
Orlando Sequera: or continuous flow.

2676
04:29:03.620 --> 04:29:07.349
Orlando Sequera: That's another a that that's another way of doing it.

2677
04:29:07.430 --> 04:29:23.000
Orlando Sequera: And it really, when it comes to the scope is the same. The level of sensitive of the requirements is low. It's not clear, so it needs further discovery, and it's going to be changing right. It's going to be changed. The scope is not fixed as it is.

2678
04:29:23.140 --> 04:29:41.009
Orlando Sequera: If we are following a predictive approach, so if that's it the situation that the scope is not well understood. It's unclear, that those are the the hints that you have to follow that will help with the following an adaptive approach is going to be better in this situation

2679
04:29:41.160 --> 04:29:43.249
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to change on risk.

2680
04:29:43.310 --> 04:29:52.149
Orlando Sequera: This is building the assumption of a high degree of change, you know, coming in, that there's going to be a lot of changes, and you also have a high torrent of

2681
04:29:52.620 --> 04:29:53.220
if

2682
04:29:53.350 --> 04:30:00.890
Orlando Sequera: some some protection in place for race management. But then you're gonna have situations in which

2683
04:30:01.650 --> 04:30:05.769
Orlando Sequera: it's better to use a combination of the 2,

2684
04:30:05.790 --> 04:30:07.330
Orlando Sequera: I can tell you.

2685
04:30:07.450 --> 04:30:11.370
Orlando Sequera: One example that comes to mind is the actual Artemis program.

2686
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:14.999
Orlando Sequera: In the out of this program we follow a Taylor

2687
04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:18.860
Orlando Sequera: approach was a combination of agile and predictive

2688
04:30:19.380 --> 04:30:25.579
Orlando Sequera: some aspects, for example, he the contract with other, with some contractors

2689
04:30:25.700 --> 04:30:31.549
Orlando Sequera: that was used. We used that a predictive approach, because

2690
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:51.839
Orlando Sequera: the scope of the contract was well understood, and for that procurement I should say procurement aspect of the Artemis program. We use an actual, a predictive approach for that. But, on the other hand, for the development of software a.

2691
04:30:52.110 --> 04:30:59.970
Orlando Sequera: I have the the chance to work on developing the software. If for payload processing and also

2692
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:19.169
Orlando Sequera: the ground, a control system application at Kennedy Space Center, and for the development piece we use the agile approach we were using. We are developing software using iterations, and we were using scrum. So we called in sprint, and

2693
04:31:19.250 --> 04:31:21.940
Orlando Sequera: they they functionally was developed

2694
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:23.519
Orlando Sequera: in

2695
04:31:23.560 --> 04:31:27.359
Orlando Sequera: in iterations incrementally based on what was the

2696
04:31:27.380 --> 04:31:34.789
Orlando Sequera: the most important functionality first, and we were delivering that functionally, incrementally, that is, within the same program.

2697
04:31:34.810 --> 04:31:37.100
Orlando Sequera: So that's an example of

2698
04:31:37.190 --> 04:31:38.500
hybrid.

2699
04:31:38.680 --> 04:31:45.629
Orlando Sequera: a approach, and it's perfectly fine multiple organizations to that All the time I will venture to say that

2700
04:31:45.950 --> 04:32:00.569
Orlando Sequera: many organizations, most organizations, use some sort of a hybrid approach rather than just pure, predictive and pure, a adaptive or agile. There's some degree of tailoring at some point in time. But.

2701
04:32:00.900 --> 04:32:14.100
Orlando Sequera: as I mentioned before, the discussion is, or the conversation, I should say, is not agile against a predictive. It's not agile versus predictive, is agile or predictive, or hybrid.

2702
04:32:14.120 --> 04:32:22.030
Orlando Sequera: These are the options that you have. You can pick and choose in what works for you. It's gonna be your best.

2703
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:27.720
Orlando Sequera: What do you have to tailor to your specific situation? Understanding what

2704
04:32:28.020 --> 04:32:32.980
Orlando Sequera: the number? One aspect is the type of scope that you're gonna be working with your project.

2705
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.789
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2706
04:32:38.770 --> 04:32:39.520
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2707
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:45.199
Orlando Sequera: Would like to review. Please vote on the questions so we can

2708
04:32:46.510 --> 04:32:51.000
question in the chat. How does one know when

2709
04:32:54.080 --> 04:33:02.829
Orlando Sequera: when a project will end when doing agile? Usually you have constraints, you have a ceiling for the duration and for the budget?

2710
04:33:02.970 --> 04:33:03.660
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2711
04:33:03.790 --> 04:33:12.629
Orlando Sequera: that is usually the case. You have a set duration. The duration is fixed. You have a year or 6 months, and then a budget, too.

2712
04:33:12.800 --> 04:33:16.089
Orlando Sequera: So that that is fixed. But the scope is what's changing.

2713
04:33:16.590 --> 04:33:19.820
Orlando Sequera: That's usually how it gets done. But you do have

2714
04:33:19.860 --> 04:33:27.210
Orlando Sequera: a fixed. In many cases you have a a sailing for your budget and a sailing for your schedule.

2715
04:33:28.110 --> 04:33:29.290
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2716
04:33:38.860 --> 04:33:40.870
There's a

2717
04:33:44.529 --> 04:33:52.450
Orlando Sequera: we'll another question in the chat. Will not a hybrid up? I'm. I'm sorry not in the chat in the Q. A. Keep saying, chat, My apologies.

2718
04:33:52.689 --> 04:33:59.059
Orlando Sequera: Will not a hybrid approach usually be the best approach? Well, not necessarily. It depends on the situation.

2719
04:33:59.110 --> 04:34:07.350
Orlando Sequera: In some cases the scope is well understood, well defined. Your team is very familiar with that type of work. That that is, I would say

2720
04:34:07.369 --> 04:34:16.389
Orlando Sequera: predictive is the best approach, or in some cases it the scope is very complex, or it's going to be changing a lot that's ha! Ha! That is going to be your best.

2721
04:34:17.050 --> 04:34:19.110
Orlando Sequera: That so it really depends on the situation.

2722
04:34:23.360 --> 04:34:24.450
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2723
04:34:29.210 --> 04:34:30.830
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

2724
04:34:34.540 --> 04:34:36.509
Orlando Sequera: can you?

2725
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:59.129
Orlando Sequera: That's the sponsor has an influence on the approaches to choose from. They can provide their opinion at all times. But this is mostly from the people doing the work. Your subject matter experts, your team. They can provide input absolutely. But this about this is for the people that are doing the work.

2726
04:34:59.140 --> 04:35:00.779
Orlando Sequera: and we have to.

2727
04:35:00.800 --> 04:35:04.109
Orlando Sequera: We shouldn't. Let a sponsor tell us how to do our work.

2728
04:35:04.439 --> 04:35:06.570
Orlando Sequera: That's not a good idea.

2729
04:35:06.700 --> 04:35:10.500
Orlando Sequera: Okay, it's about the so do matter experts, the people that are doing the work.

2730
04:35:14.880 --> 04:35:18.169
Orlando Sequera: If the project. Finally, the chartered Nope. You define that later.

2731
04:35:21.320 --> 04:35:22.910
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

2732
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:33.519
Orlando Sequera: Can you please differentiate between the terms agile? Okay, adjun and scrum scrum is one form of agile.

2733
04:35:33.640 --> 04:35:39.729
Orlando Sequera: It's the most popular, and, as I mentioned before, think of agile like ice cream. Right!

2734
04:35:40.220 --> 04:35:42.020
Orlando Sequera: You don't have one flavor

2735
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:48.960
Orlando Sequera: of ice cream you have. Do you have more than just chocolate, right and vanilla. You have multiple flavors. Same thing happens with agile.

2736
04:35:49.140 --> 04:35:54.650
Orlando Sequera: You have multiple flavors of agile. You have scrum is the most popular one.

2737
04:35:55.360 --> 04:35:56.640
Orlando Sequera: A. Perhaps

2738
04:35:57.000 --> 04:36:04.789
Orlando Sequera: because it's easy to implement You can do it at the team level, and is one of the the first

2739
04:36:05.500 --> 04:36:08.240
Orlando Sequera: flavors of agile. There's a lot of

2740
04:36:08.279 --> 04:36:13.479
Orlando Sequera: a th. There is a lot of experience associated with Crumb, but it's

2741
04:36:13.509 --> 04:36:24.940
Orlando Sequera: one flavor of agile X string stream programming Xps and other flavor. You have multiple flavors. You have discipline, agile, multiple flavors. Okay, so that's the best analogy.

2742
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:26.329
Orlando Sequera: Ice cream

2743
04:36:28.200 --> 04:36:30.039
Orlando Sequera: is the chocolate or agile.

2744
04:36:32.939 --> 04:36:34.230
Hmm.

2745
04:36:41.330 --> 04:36:48.770
Orlando Sequera: We're all the key decision makers in the Pm. Development approach mainly Just so, you matter experts. Your team members should be, and the project manager.

2746
04:36:49.950 --> 04:36:57.159
Orlando Sequera: You shouldn't be told by the sponsors or stakeholders how to do the word they should come from your, from the people doing the work.

2747
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:10.399
Orlando Sequera: Could you please elaborate on risk, manager and predictive versus adaptive. I will when we get to risk management. Not now. Risk is a separate area.

2748
04:37:13.220 --> 04:37:21.349
Orlando Sequera: We use another. Come a question in the chat. We use a team contacts, races, sheet instead of project register

2749
04:37:21.630 --> 04:37:29.920
Orlando Sequera: on the test exam will be run to say, update sponsor on the racing teams contact. She? Yes, that that please follow

2750
04:37:30.529 --> 04:37:32.450
Orlando Sequera: the terminology.

2751
04:37:32.610 --> 04:37:38.600
Orlando Sequera: even though that's perfectly fine. You can do it. Organizations do it differently, but

2752
04:37:38.820 --> 04:37:45.889
Orlando Sequera: for the exam. And thank you for that question, because it allows me to explain one very important aspect of the Pmp. Exam.

2753
04:37:46.000 --> 04:37:53.930
Orlando Sequera: Answer, based on the Pmp. Terminology that we are using. Assume that you have to create all these

2754
04:37:54.259 --> 04:38:13.130
Orlando Sequera: for your projects. When you're answering the Pmp questions, and for the Pmp. Exam, you have to create a separate stakeholder register and a separate racy matrix. Okay, even though in your organization you it sounds like you combine that. So for 4 December 2 separate things. Okay.

2755
04:38:13.140 --> 04:38:17.150
Orlando Sequera: Answer: based on Pmi terminology.

2756
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:18.520
Orlando Sequera: and

2757
04:38:18.800 --> 04:38:29.069
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna get. Do you? Have you have to follow that? That's part of the Pmi mindset Answer. Based on the Pmi guidelines. These are the the best practices.

2758
04:38:29.279 --> 04:38:31.809
Orlando Sequera: So thank you for that question.

2759
04:38:35.640 --> 04:38:41.910
Orlando Sequera: Share product, example of hybrid project approach. I just did with the Artemis program. So that's done

2760
04:38:44.210 --> 04:38:57.510
Orlando Sequera: in agile. How do we handle? Change? Request you don't create change, request in agile? No, that what you do is you prioritize your product backlog with your product owner. You, Don't, have change, request in Agile.

2761
04:39:01.720 --> 04:39:03.670
Orlando Sequera: That's the sponsor. Have an

2762
04:39:03.810 --> 04:39:10.769
Orlando Sequera: influence on the approaches to choose from. They can provide. Input but it should be mainly the people doing the work

2763
04:39:10.919 --> 04:39:14.319
Orlando Sequera: they shouldn't tell you how to do your work.

2764
04:39:17.330 --> 04:39:18.280
Orlando Sequera: Right?

2765
04:39:19.400 --> 04:39:20.759
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2766
04:39:20.800 --> 04:39:22.050
Orlando Sequera: Let's continue

2767
04:39:24.320 --> 04:39:33.599
Orlando Sequera: an important aspect that many people get confused a couple of things a. It's important to understand the difference between the

2768
04:39:33.779 --> 04:39:37.890
Orlando Sequera: project, life, cycle and the product

2769
04:39:38.060 --> 04:39:39.910
Orlando Sequera: management, life, cycle.

2770
04:39:40.320 --> 04:39:42.980
Orlando Sequera: product, management. By the way, product

2771
04:39:43.000 --> 04:39:47.100
Orlando Sequera: product management is not in the scope of the exam.

2772
04:39:47.240 --> 04:39:51.869
Orlando Sequera: The exam is about project management, however.

2773
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:56.970
Orlando Sequera: Product owners are going to appear in some exam scenario questions.

2774
04:39:57.100 --> 04:40:01.550
Orlando Sequera: and the role must be understood. The product owner.

2775
04:40:02.190 --> 04:40:07.610
Orlando Sequera: and mainly mainly this is in agile. The product owner is

2776
04:40:07.710 --> 04:40:09.910
Orlando Sequera: the liation between

2777
04:40:10.460 --> 04:40:11.380
Orlando Sequera: they

2778
04:40:11.960 --> 04:40:13.830
Orlando Sequera: business and

2779
04:40:14.460 --> 04:40:15.879
Orlando Sequera: the project team

2780
04:40:16.920 --> 04:40:23.820
Orlando Sequera: Exaliation between the business and the project team is an individual in charge of the scope

2781
04:40:24.040 --> 04:40:25.220
Orlando Sequera: of the project.

2782
04:40:25.570 --> 04:40:27.700
Orlando Sequera: So that's what the product owner is.

2783
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:41.260
Orlando Sequera: They are responsible, as we see here, for maximum maximizing the value of the product, and they are accountable for the end product. They are responsible for maximizing the value because they are in charge of

2784
04:40:41.570 --> 04:40:46.510
Orlando Sequera: prioritizing the to do list that we have for our project.

2785
04:40:46.680 --> 04:40:54.550
Orlando Sequera: and by to do list I mean the product backlog. It's a running list of features that need to be developed.

2786
04:40:54.700 --> 04:41:12.229
Orlando Sequera: and the one in charge of that is the product owner. They maximize the value by may, by prioritizing that list of features that needs to be developed. Okay. So, product owner, we have to get familiar with. But product management is not in the scope

2787
04:41:12.460 --> 04:41:14.090
Orlando Sequera: or the Pmp exempt

2788
04:41:15.580 --> 04:41:16.480
Orlando Sequera: and

2789
04:41:17.890 --> 04:41:21.339
Orlando Sequera: product management is basically a key immigration point.

2790
04:41:21.900 --> 04:41:25.410
Orlando Sequera: The product is going to be part of project requirements, right?

2791
04:41:25.500 --> 04:41:28.319
Orlando Sequera: A, and that has to do with the scope of the project

2792
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:31.779
Orlando Sequera: for management product management

2793
04:41:31.860 --> 04:41:32.890
Orlando Sequera: is

2794
04:41:33.210 --> 04:41:40.920
Orlando Sequera: going to involve the integration of people, data processes and business systems to be able to create and maintain

2795
04:41:41.010 --> 04:41:42.890
Orlando Sequera: product service

2796
04:41:43.400 --> 04:41:45.690
Orlando Sequera: throughout its life cycle.

2797
04:41:46.340 --> 04:41:51.520
Orlando Sequera: It's a series of faces product, life, cycle. It's a series of faces

2798
04:41:51.540 --> 04:41:57.920
Orlando Sequera: that represents the evolution of a product from the introduction, as we see here

2799
04:41:58.410 --> 04:42:02.330
Orlando Sequera: all the way through retirement or decline.

2800
04:42:02.480 --> 04:42:03.290
Orlando Sequera: Okay

2801
04:42:03.880 --> 04:42:07.390
Orlando Sequera: and product management, product management

2802
04:42:07.940 --> 04:42:12.039
Orlando Sequera: and any shape programs or projects at any point.

2803
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:16.800
Orlando Sequera: That's why you see, Project 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 here

2804
04:42:17.010 --> 04:42:19.920
Orlando Sequera: throughout the entire life cycle. Okay.

2805
04:42:19.970 --> 04:42:22.460
Orlando Sequera: So it's an integration point.

2806
04:42:22.920 --> 04:42:28.280
Orlando Sequera: But for the exam, what's really in scope is project

2807
04:42:28.340 --> 04:42:29.520
Orlando Sequera: management.

2808
04:42:29.600 --> 04:42:30.290
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2809
04:42:30.780 --> 04:42:31.969
Orlando Sequera: project management.

2810
04:42:33.690 --> 04:42:34.860
Orlando Sequera: right?

2811
04:42:35.120 --> 04:42:36.790
Orlando Sequera: And

2812
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:39.480
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more

2813
04:42:39.660 --> 04:42:40.620
Orlando Sequera: about

2814
04:42:41.140 --> 04:42:42.769
Orlando Sequera: the life cycle.

2815
04:42:42.990 --> 04:42:51.329
Orlando Sequera: the life cycle and development approach. So we start somewhere. The project life cycle is the progression

2816
04:42:51.840 --> 04:42:54.340
Orlando Sequera: through a series of development stages.

2817
04:42:54.660 --> 04:43:01.779
Orlando Sequera: right all the way from start to completion when the final deliverables are completed.

2818
04:43:01.880 --> 04:43:04.059
Orlando Sequera: This is how you organize

2819
04:43:04.210 --> 04:43:06.400
Orlando Sequera: doing the work of your project.

2820
04:43:06.870 --> 04:43:12.280
Orlando Sequera: the logical breakdown that you have to follow in order to produce project deliverables.

2821
04:43:12.340 --> 04:43:12.990
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2822
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:18.539
Orlando Sequera: the project life cycle is going to be based on the industry that you're working on

2823
04:43:19.440 --> 04:43:24.349
Orlando Sequera: and organizational preferences and the development approach that you are

2824
04:43:24.450 --> 04:43:28.680
Orlando Sequera: that you are following the development approach, I mean predictive, adaptive

2825
04:43:28.700 --> 04:43:30.090
Orlando Sequera: or hybrid.

2826
04:43:30.450 --> 04:43:36.699
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so pretty much the development approach is going to dictate how the project work is going to be conducted.

2827
04:43:42.880 --> 04:43:44.650
Orlando Sequera: And this is an example.

2828
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:50.399
Orlando Sequera: Let's take a this is an actual predictive life cycle, right? And this is

2829
04:43:50.820 --> 04:43:53.590
Orlando Sequera: a graph of representation why we call it waterfall.

2830
04:43:54.240 --> 04:43:58.440
Orlando Sequera: So this shows a single face and an outline of the predictive

2831
04:43:59.330 --> 04:44:00.120
Orlando Sequera: approach.

2832
04:44:00.270 --> 04:44:15.529
Orlando Sequera: and this is a the Project Management Cycle is applied to each face. Using this predictive approach, meaning that before we move to design we have to complete visibility, and before we start working on building we have to complete the sign. Okay. So they are

2833
04:44:16.370 --> 04:44:21.390
Orlando Sequera: really useful when you have fixed requirements. When you have a fixed scope

2834
04:44:21.650 --> 04:44:27.469
Orlando Sequera: and your final ex, your fixed expectations of, though of that scope.

2835
04:44:27.840 --> 04:44:30.010
Orlando Sequera: When you understand the scope really well

2836
04:44:30.130 --> 04:44:32.390
Orlando Sequera: it, this is your best bet.

2837
04:44:32.460 --> 04:44:35.770
Orlando Sequera: There is a high element of control in

2838
04:44:35.890 --> 04:44:38.140
Orlando Sequera: By that I mean predictability

2839
04:44:38.900 --> 04:44:43.499
Orlando Sequera: in projects that follow a predictive life cycle. The plans drive

2840
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:45.990
Orlando Sequera: the completion of the project. So this is

2841
04:44:46.260 --> 04:44:49.019
Orlando Sequera: a predictive life cycle in a visual format.

2842
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:50.050
Orlando Sequera: but

2843
04:44:50.090 --> 04:44:53.359
Orlando Sequera: an adaptive like life cycle

2844
04:44:56.610 --> 04:45:02.140
Orlando Sequera: is a little bit different. We work in iterations, we work in iterations.

2845
04:45:02.670 --> 04:45:06.849
Orlando Sequera: It comes from the word iterari. It means that we do it multiple times.

2846
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:13.430
Orlando Sequera: Okay, comes from Latin. So this works better in situations in which

2847
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:26.399
Orlando Sequera: you have multiple changes. So you work on developing the functionally for a iteration number one. Then at the end you get feedback from your stakeholders.

2848
04:45:26.570 --> 04:45:28.980
Orlando Sequera: You pre prioritize the scope.

2849
04:45:29.720 --> 04:45:41.750
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by backward reproduction, based on what based on value. And this this is going to be changing from one iteration to another, and then you start your iteration.

2850
04:45:42.690 --> 04:45:47.000
Orlando Sequera: and at the end of the iteration Again, you get the feedback from your stakeholders.

2851
04:45:47.820 --> 04:45:56.159
Orlando Sequera: and you perform again backlog reproduction, which is re- prioritizing the features that you have to build

2852
04:45:56.560 --> 04:45:58.289
Orlando Sequera: before you start working

2853
04:45:58.320 --> 04:46:00.740
Orlando Sequera: on the next iteration until

2854
04:46:01.130 --> 04:46:04.620
Orlando Sequera: you are able to produce the final product service

2855
04:46:05.530 --> 04:46:06.590
Orlando Sequera: A:

2856
04:46:06.660 --> 04:46:08.000
Orlando Sequera: that was intended.

2857
04:46:08.120 --> 04:46:11.679
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So we do things multiple times

2858
04:46:11.760 --> 04:46:18.190
Orlando Sequera: it rather than one big bank that we do in predictive. They're similar in a way.

2859
04:46:18.460 --> 04:46:22.739
Orlando Sequera: but the main differences, and by that I mean predictive and adaptive.

2860
04:46:22.840 --> 04:46:26.550
We do planning, we have planning in

2861
04:46:26.830 --> 04:46:28.590
Orlando Sequera: in in adaptive.

2862
04:46:29.120 --> 04:46:31.789
Orlando Sequera: we, but it's not a long face like

2863
04:46:31.870 --> 04:46:40.910
Orlando Sequera: what we have in predictive. But we do, planning one for each iteration. We do development, we do testing, and we do deployment. So it's

2864
04:46:41.090 --> 04:46:49.800
Orlando Sequera: basically what changes is the frequency we do it multiple times. That's how we can accommodate change if we are following an agile approach.

2865
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:51.720
Orlando Sequera: If.

2866
04:46:52.130 --> 04:46:54.339
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the cadence.

2867
04:46:56.400 --> 04:46:59.789
Orlando Sequera: this is about the timing and frequency of

2868
04:47:00.320 --> 04:47:01.610
Orlando Sequera: delivery

2869
04:47:01.860 --> 04:47:04.629
Orlando Sequera: A. The delivery of project deliverables

2870
04:47:05.160 --> 04:47:06.900
Orlando Sequera: usually for

2871
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:11.420
Orlando Sequera: A. If we're following a predictive approach, we have a single

2872
04:47:11.650 --> 04:47:15.780
Orlando Sequera: a single cadence, which is one big delivery at the end of the project.

2873
04:47:16.020 --> 04:47:35.890
Orlando Sequera: That's usually what happens in construction. Right? We deliver the house completed. We'll do partial delivery like. Oh, we've delivering just the internal structure or just the foundation. No, we deliver the entire house completed it's one single delivery. The house built completely built at the end of the project.

2874
04:47:36.500 --> 04:47:38.449
Orlando Sequera: That's a single cadence.

2875
04:47:38.730 --> 04:47:39.950
Orlando Sequera: We can

2876
04:47:40.300 --> 04:47:49.990
Orlando Sequera: follow an approach in which we do multiple deliveries. The Liberals are separate into parts. They're not necessarily sequentially. For example.

2877
04:47:50.630 --> 04:47:53.640
Orlando Sequera: in the form of silica in the pharmaceutical industry.

2878
04:47:54.130 --> 04:48:10.820
Orlando Sequera: When they're trying to develop a new drug, they might have multiple deliveries. The first one might be the trial results. The second delivery might be the registration, and the third delivery might be the actual launch to the market.

2879
04:48:10.970 --> 04:48:16.440
Orlando Sequera: So some projects have multiple deliveries they don't necessarily have to be sequential.

2880
04:48:16.480 --> 04:48:34.389
Orlando Sequera: but they can be deliver separately. A. For example, if you're trying, another example will be if you're trying to update a security building for the government. You can delivery. You can deliver initially physical barriers, a new badging system.

2881
04:48:34.400 --> 04:48:40.120
Orlando Sequera: or a new key copath for a a keypad for entry.

2882
04:48:40.340 --> 04:48:48.670
Orlando Sequera: but they don't have to come in specific orders. That's a multiple delivery. So some projects. You have a multiple delivery that that's fine.

2883
04:48:48.720 --> 04:48:50.760
Orlando Sequera: or you can have

2884
04:48:50.900 --> 04:48:52.830
Orlando Sequera: a periodic delivery.

2885
04:48:52.990 --> 04:49:02.480
Orlando Sequera: and it's similar to multiple deliveries. But they are on a fixed schedule. We're doing this deliveries every month every 2 months.

2886
04:49:02.540 --> 04:49:05.110
Orlando Sequera: If software application.

2887
04:49:05.250 --> 04:49:06.100
Orlando Sequera: a

2888
04:49:06.170 --> 04:49:20.440
Orlando Sequera: software application projects, software development projects are a good example. You can deliver functionally every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks, every 4 weeks. That's we're following Kate, that cadence. It's a pre all the cadence. So

2889
04:49:20.720 --> 04:49:22.670
Orlando Sequera: we have 3 types of cadences.

2890
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:25.490
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2891
04:49:29.420 --> 04:49:32.599
Orlando Sequera: This is how the adaptive

2892
04:49:32.920 --> 04:49:37.700
Orlando Sequera: or agile development approach works, and this pretty much

2893
04:49:37.760 --> 04:49:41.039
Orlando Sequera: covers a what we do

2894
04:49:41.290 --> 04:49:47.809
Orlando Sequera: in adjo. It's gonna allow everyone to understand a little bit more about agile.

2895
04:49:50.840 --> 04:50:00.430
Orlando Sequera: Want to take a few minutes to go over this. I know you. You're having a lot of questions. We're going to address them a little bit later. Okay, so let's start understanding. Please pay attention to what?

2896
04:50:00.640 --> 04:50:06.429
Orlando Sequera: To to what we're covering here. This is important, especially for those of you that are new to

2897
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:09.000
Orlando Sequera: in the far left.

2898
04:50:10.570 --> 04:50:14.320
Orlando Sequera: We start with developing the actual

2899
04:50:14.690 --> 04:50:16.340
Orlando Sequera: initial vision

2900
04:50:16.410 --> 04:50:17.190
Orlando Sequera: off

2901
04:50:18.080 --> 04:50:19.190
Orlando Sequera: the project.

2902
04:50:20.350 --> 04:50:21.380
Orlando Sequera: A

2903
04:50:21.610 --> 04:50:23.079
Orlando Sequera: an example.

2904
04:50:23.180 --> 04:50:26.380
Orlando Sequera: Go back in time. When he 20,

2905
04:50:26.530 --> 04:50:42.660
Orlando Sequera: a pharmaceutical companies, probably all of you remember they were trying to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. There was a race that all these major, from a certain companies, had in the end goal. They knew where where they were going. They were trying to produce a

2906
04:50:42.670 --> 04:50:51.429
Orlando Sequera: vaccine for COVID-19, with a high rate of efficiency and efficiency. That was the goal. How do we do that?

2907
04:50:51.640 --> 04:50:52.570
Orlando Sequera: We don't know

2908
04:50:52.780 --> 04:51:01.679
Orlando Sequera: we have. We're we're going to work on that. But that's the end grow. That's that initial vision. So in that case, since we don't know how to get

2909
04:51:02.360 --> 04:51:03.220
Orlando Sequera: there.

2910
04:51:03.410 --> 04:51:12.230
Orlando Sequera: that means that we're gonna be making we're gonna be changing directions multiple times. So chances are that at least in the development

2911
04:51:12.340 --> 04:51:13.360
Orlando Sequera: aspect

2912
04:51:13.570 --> 04:51:17.320
Orlando Sequera: of the vaccine. They followed an adaptive approach

2913
04:51:17.970 --> 04:51:28.320
Orlando Sequera: because they knew that they were maybe chain making changes, changing course, changing course at multiple times, so they start with creating a product backlog.

2914
04:51:28.510 --> 04:51:30.570
Orlando Sequera: A product backlog is

2915
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:44.889
Orlando Sequera: an artifact. It's a running to do list. It's a running list of features that need to be developed by the project team. It's a container of features of functionality that

2916
04:51:45.210 --> 04:51:51.270
Orlando Sequera: basically. Oh, it's it's a running list that is always going to be changing. It's always going to be changing. Okay.

2917
04:51:51.290 --> 04:51:55.340
Orlando Sequera: based on what based on the priorities that our stakeholders have.

2918
04:51:55.570 --> 04:52:10.450
Orlando Sequera: That's how we can accommodate change. So. And that's why we say that this scope is not fixed in natural. It's going to be changing. We already know that going in. That's why we're using a pro backlog. That's why

2919
04:52:10.520 --> 04:52:14.400
Orlando Sequera: i'm sorry that's why we're using an adaptive approach and not a predictive approach.

2920
04:52:14.490 --> 04:52:23.000
Orlando Sequera: The equivalent of the product backlog in predictive is something that we call a work breakdown structure, which is

2921
04:52:23.210 --> 04:52:38.150
Orlando Sequera: a graphic representation of the entire scope of the project. We're building the house and the Wbs is going to have all the information it's gonna cover all the information that that of the work that we have to complete, for

2922
04:52:38.480 --> 04:52:55.349
Orlando Sequera: in order to build that house. Okay. But here is different. We have a running list of functionality that is going to be changing. Some of that functionality is gonna drop completely. We might add new functionality. We might have to reorganize that. And we're gonna be doing that each

2923
04:52:55.720 --> 04:53:01.020
Orlando Sequera: every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks, every 4 weeks. Okay, then we move on

2924
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:03.749
Orlando Sequera: to the actual iteration

2925
04:53:04.210 --> 04:53:12.429
Orlando Sequera: or sprint in that in scrum. Okay, they use the worst print here, because strum is very popular, and

2926
04:53:12.650 --> 04:53:18.769
Orlando Sequera: but it's the same things. It's Spring and iteration are the same thing. So

2927
04:53:19.180 --> 04:53:30.579
Orlando Sequera: from the per backlog we take those features, and we break them down. That functionality into requirements in agile. We call the requirements user stories.

2928
04:53:30.770 --> 04:53:32.820
Orlando Sequera: That's how we manage requirements.

2929
04:53:32.890 --> 04:53:38.599
Orlando Sequera: but it is different from predictive, as we're going to see when we talk about scope.

2930
04:53:38.940 --> 04:53:45.940
Orlando Sequera: These user stories are simple descriptions of the functionality from the customers perspective.

2931
04:53:46.730 --> 04:53:50.600
Orlando Sequera: and we'll elaborate on that a little bit later. But this is how we write

2932
04:53:50.920 --> 04:54:03.150
Orlando Sequera: requirements in agile in using the form of user stories. It's a short description of the functionality toll from the perspective of the customer They what what is it that I that

2933
04:54:03.960 --> 04:54:07.029
Orlando Sequera: that that I'm, that i'm looking for an example?

2934
04:54:07.140 --> 04:54:12.610
Orlando Sequera: Let's go back to the example of the software? For the accounting department. An example would be

2935
04:54:12.850 --> 04:54:18.199
Orlando Sequera: as a as an administrator. It starts with a role. Usually user stories

2936
04:54:18.490 --> 04:54:28.659
Orlando Sequera: start with a role as an administrator. I would like to be able to generate a monthly sales report. That is the second element, the actual functionality.

2937
04:54:29.140 --> 04:54:32.589
Orlando Sequera: And the third element of a user's story is the benefit.

2938
04:54:32.930 --> 04:54:43.399
Orlando Sequera: so that I can understand the monthly sales for the organization at any given time. So those are the 3 elements that you have with the user story. That's how we write requirements in agile okay.

2939
04:54:44.120 --> 04:54:45.110
Orlando Sequera: for

2940
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:47.480
Orlando Sequera: during the iteration

2941
04:54:47.840 --> 04:54:51.920
Orlando Sequera: the team is going to grab some of the functionality.

2942
04:54:52.300 --> 04:54:54.399
Orlando Sequera: So in some of the functionality.

2943
04:54:54.840 --> 04:55:01.249
Orlando Sequera: some of those requirements written in the form of user stories, and they're going to start working on the developing those requirements

2944
04:55:01.400 --> 04:55:02.859
Orlando Sequera: in the actual.

2945
04:55:03.570 --> 04:55:04.790
Orlando Sequera: A,

2946
04:55:05.680 --> 04:55:09.630
Orlando Sequera: in the actual iteration of spring. This is when they're going to be doing the work.

2947
04:55:09.760 --> 04:55:15.920
Orlando Sequera: and then we see something here, Minimum viable product, Mvp: that is.

2948
04:55:16.140 --> 04:55:17.730
Orlando Sequera: for new products

2949
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:35.989
Orlando Sequera: that is applicable to new products, new services, and new results. That's version one of what we're trying to do version one of that COVID-19 vaccine, and the team is gonna start working. And at the end of the iteration they're gonna deliver to the customer, and when they do that there's a specific ceremony

2950
04:55:36.000 --> 04:55:41.860
Orlando Sequera: for that. It's a spring review or Iteration Review, and that's where they're going to get cut

2951
04:55:42.090 --> 04:55:43.470
Orlando Sequera: customer feedback

2952
04:55:43.870 --> 04:55:48.070
Orlando Sequera: and depending on the customer feedback, they're going to

2953
04:55:48.200 --> 04:56:06.790
Orlando Sequera: a some functionality is not going to be accepted. Some new sisters are not going to be accepted. They're going to be drop, or we're going to have to make changes. That means that they need to. They're not accepted. They need to go back to the per backlog to be worked on at a later time. But some of that functionality is going to be accepted.

2954
04:56:06.800 --> 04:56:13.619
Orlando Sequera: and that can be delivered to production. Okay, that in essence, how it works, it's a little bit more

2955
04:56:14.080 --> 04:56:16.029
Orlando Sequera: a involved in that.

2956
04:56:16.100 --> 04:56:21.120
Orlando Sequera: But that's in essence how the adaptive development or agile

2957
04:56:21.870 --> 04:56:30.179
Orlando Sequera: a framework or approach works that's in essence. How it works okay, little bit different from what we do with with predictive.

2958
04:56:30.690 --> 04:56:31.480
Orlando Sequera: Now

2959
04:56:32.660 --> 04:56:33.840
Orlando Sequera: going to go over

2960
04:56:34.040 --> 04:56:35.670
Orlando Sequera: a little quiz here.

2961
04:56:37.140 --> 04:56:38.560
Orlando Sequera: If

2962
04:56:38.870 --> 04:56:42.260
Orlando Sequera: this is about development, approach and life cycle terminology.

2963
04:56:42.550 --> 04:56:45.670
Orlando Sequera: So project professionals use

2964
04:56:46.040 --> 04:56:46.910
Orlando Sequera: a

2965
04:56:48.780 --> 04:56:52.410
Orlando Sequera: deliverable development, approach faces or life cycle.

2966
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:53.670
Orlando Sequera: It is

2967
04:56:53.790 --> 04:56:55.280
Orlando Sequera: a development approach

2968
04:56:55.440 --> 04:56:57.460
Orlando Sequera: which can be predictive.

2969
04:56:57.550 --> 04:57:03.170
Orlando Sequera: iterative, incremental, adaptive or hybrid to create and evolve a

2970
04:57:04.880 --> 04:57:16.179
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna be to create a that's what we produce with our project work which are the deliverables which is you and unique and verifiable products. We saw our capability to perform a service.

2971
04:57:16.490 --> 04:57:22.670
Orlando Sequera: A project is gonna pass through a series of logical related activities that we call

2972
04:57:23.580 --> 04:57:24.740
Orlando Sequera: basis

2973
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:32.740
Orlando Sequera: from it starts to its completion, and this entire process from beginning to end. We call it

2974
04:57:32.930 --> 04:57:34.730
Orlando Sequera: life cycle

2975
04:57:34.860 --> 04:57:35.520
Orlando Sequera: right.

2976
04:57:35.650 --> 04:57:37.840
Orlando Sequera: and the acceptance

2977
04:57:39.190 --> 04:57:40.470
Orlando Sequera: of a

2978
04:57:40.930 --> 04:57:49.640
Orlando Sequera: blank. It's required to complete a process face of project, acceptance of what we produce with our work the acceptance of a deliverable

2979
04:57:50.110 --> 04:57:50.960
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2980
04:57:52.410 --> 04:57:53.380
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2981
04:57:53.440 --> 04:57:54.470
Orlando Sequera: And

2982
04:58:01.800 --> 04:58:06.789
Orlando Sequera: according to to Pmi research, and this is also my experience.

2983
04:58:06.960 --> 04:58:13.100
Orlando Sequera: Most projects. If you pay close attention, most projects and projects are hybrids.

2984
04:58:13.940 --> 04:58:33.010
Orlando Sequera: Most products are a combination of adaptive and predictive in some cases, that it would even venture to say that some organizations think that they're being 100% agile. But they're not. They have some to some degree, some predictive in their in the way they manage their projects. Most organizations for

2985
04:58:33.020 --> 04:58:36.470
Orlando Sequera: under that hybrid approach. Okay. But

2986
04:58:36.920 --> 04:58:39.430
Orlando Sequera: the keyboard here is tailoring.

2987
04:58:39.540 --> 04:58:41.060
Orlando Sequera: tailoring. If

2988
04:58:41.120 --> 04:58:44.949
Orlando Sequera: add that in project processes to the work that needs to be done

2989
04:58:45.610 --> 04:58:54.800
Orlando Sequera: as a pretty professional. Ideally, you should have the flexibility to tailor your approach for the exam that has to be part of your

2990
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:56.400
Orlando Sequera: B and P. Mindset.

2991
04:58:56.680 --> 04:59:11.760
Orlando Sequera: You have the flexibility to choose the act, the best approach for your project, maybe in real life, in your current in your current organization, that's not the case. You are kind of forced to use a particular approach.

2992
04:59:12.430 --> 04:59:13.860
Orlando Sequera: not for the exam.

2993
04:59:13.880 --> 04:59:19.250
Orlando Sequera: You have that flexibility to choose the best approach for your situation.

2994
04:59:19.940 --> 04:59:28.780
Orlando Sequera: What we do with hybrid we combine both adaptive and predictive life cycles and development approaches. That's perfectly fine.

2995
04:59:29.480 --> 04:59:32.250
Orlando Sequera: This works well when the deliberals can be

2996
04:59:32.290 --> 04:59:33.660
Orlando Sequera: modularized

2997
04:59:33.720 --> 04:59:34.570
Orlando Sequera: or

2998
04:59:34.920 --> 04:59:45.379
Orlando Sequera: and which is leveraging modular development of the Liberals, or we can enable organizations to put more than one team to work on a project.

2999
04:59:45.800 --> 04:59:55.220
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and they use usually for development. They use an iterative and incremental. They use an agile approach for the development piece. They use an agile approach.

3000
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:57.290
Orlando Sequera: even when we're doing hybrid

3001
04:59:57.960 --> 04:59:58.760
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3002
04:59:58.920 --> 05:00:01.260
Orlando Sequera: a a few examples

3003
05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:04.800
Orlando Sequera: for hybrid.

3004
05:00:04.890 --> 05:00:06.190
Orlando Sequera: for the approaches.

3005
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:12.120
Orlando Sequera: A it is perfectly possible to use.

3006
05:00:16.680 --> 05:00:17.290
is

3007
05:00:17.460 --> 05:00:24.029
Orlando Sequera: my apologies. It's perfectly possible to use agile, or it's a rep. It. Iterative practices

3008
05:00:24.060 --> 05:00:27.070
Orlando Sequera: iterative practices within a predictive framework

3009
05:00:27.660 --> 05:00:34.930
Orlando Sequera: when you're building predictive artifacts or processes within an adaptive life cycle. When you're using business analysis, techniques

3010
05:00:35.000 --> 05:00:42.479
Orlando Sequera: helping with requirements management. When you start using new tools to identify complex elements and projects.

3011
05:00:42.620 --> 05:00:52.880
Orlando Sequera: Or when you're using organizational change mentioned method to prefer for transition and projects outputs into the organization. These are examples of hybrid project approaches.

3012
05:00:53.900 --> 05:00:57.480
Orlando Sequera: and you might be wondering what can be tailored.

3013
05:00:57.510 --> 05:01:02.540
Orlando Sequera: What can we, tailor specifically in a project that makes it a hybrid?

3014
05:01:03.150 --> 05:01:04.320
Orlando Sequera: The answer is.

3015
05:01:05.650 --> 05:01:08.120
Orlando Sequera: you can tailor the type

3016
05:01:08.940 --> 05:01:09.560
Orlando Sequera: of

3017
05:01:09.610 --> 05:01:12.410
Orlando Sequera: project life cycle and the faces that you use.

3018
05:01:13.830 --> 05:01:19.830
Orlando Sequera: You can, tailor. How the how will the war be performed? That means the development life cycle components.

3019
05:01:22.120 --> 05:01:23.819
Orlando Sequera: That's the team. Need a lot of

3020
05:01:24.050 --> 05:01:28.430
Orlando Sequera: continue continuous customer, feedback to the middle of the project. Yes or no.

3021
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:36.670
Orlando Sequera: You can also tailor the way of working, which is how the people will on the project will work together.

3022
05:01:36.760 --> 05:01:48.370
Orlando Sequera: What kind of management approach should we use? We can also tailor the the knowledge management aspect, which is, how can the team make sure that we're following a collaborative

3023
05:01:48.670 --> 05:01:49.740
Orlando Sequera: approach?

3024
05:01:49.980 --> 05:01:52.540
Orlando Sequera: A: when it comes to the working environment

3025
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:57.819
Orlando Sequera: change management. How the team going to approach changes to the project Work

3026
05:01:58.560 --> 05:02:01.879
Orlando Sequera: A that can be Taylor as well project governance.

3027
05:02:02.180 --> 05:02:09.349
Orlando Sequera: Where will pretty governance be located inside the project. Is the Pmo. Involved? Yes or no?

3028
05:02:09.580 --> 05:02:18.380
Orlando Sequera: Will the team establish a governance board? Yes or no, so you can tailor the private governance in some cases, and even benefits management.

3029
05:02:18.740 --> 05:02:22.789
Orlando Sequera: Who's responsible? How we're going to measure the the

3030
05:02:22.810 --> 05:02:29.289
Orlando Sequera: those benefits come into fruition. And when is all of this? Decide all of that can be tailored

3031
05:02:31.080 --> 05:02:31.970
Orlando Sequera: right.

3032
05:02:36.710 --> 05:02:41.649
Orlando Sequera: We are getting awfully close to our second break, but before that

3033
05:02:41.680 --> 05:02:44.060
Orlando Sequera: I am going to

3034
05:02:50.140 --> 05:02:51.630
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Going to review

3035
05:02:52.720 --> 05:02:55.420
Orlando Sequera: the Q. And a. I'm. Going to look for

3036
05:02:57.370 --> 05:03:02.090
Orlando Sequera: questions and remember to vote on the questions. Those are the ones that are going to be answered

3037
05:03:02.420 --> 05:03:03.640
Orlando Sequera: first.

3038
05:03:04.420 --> 05:03:09.170
Orlando Sequera: Right have your approach actually usually means each iteration of adaptive

3039
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:16.259
Orlando Sequera: is predictive. No, it means that you're combining, using aspects of adaptive. And well, i'm predictive.

3040
05:03:16.880 --> 05:03:31.949
Orlando Sequera: Can a hybrid approach. Also be multiple, that it will create the faces. It's a little more involved than that. It's not just about the faces or the iterations. It's a little more than that. You can incorpor any aspect of vague, any aspect of a of adaptive.

3041
05:03:31.960 --> 05:03:39.260
Orlando Sequera: Combine that with other aspects of predictive, not necessarily on the faces or iterations so a little bit more involved than just that

3042
05:03:40.740 --> 05:03:43.530
Orlando Sequera: I will probably recommend you to

3043
05:03:43.700 --> 05:03:44.850
Orlando Sequera: review.

3044
05:03:45.640 --> 05:03:52.180
Orlando Sequera: if for those of you that are new to agile. I will strongly suggest you to read

3045
05:03:53.070 --> 05:03:54.860
Orlando Sequera: the agile Practice Guide.

3046
05:03:55.160 --> 05:04:00.510
Orlando Sequera: This covers all the agile that you need to know to be successful in the Pmp. Exam.

3047
05:04:00.540 --> 05:04:02.360
Orlando Sequera: This is one of the references

3048
05:04:02.450 --> 05:04:03.400
Orlando Sequera: is

3049
05:04:03.950 --> 05:04:14.959
Orlando Sequera: given. Take a 100 pages of content. This is a light reading. This I will recommend you to read, especially for those of you that are new to agile. I would recommend you to read the add, your practice guide.

3050
05:04:15.100 --> 05:04:16.840
Orlando Sequera: So polish my Pmi.

3051
05:04:16.900 --> 05:04:20.130
Orlando Sequera: It's called the agile practice. Guy: okay.

3052
05:04:23.400 --> 05:04:24.649
Orlando Sequera: let me.

3053
05:04:25.170 --> 05:04:31.690
Orlando Sequera: Can you repeat the 3 parts of a user story? Absolutely. The first element is the user.

3054
05:04:32.880 --> 05:04:37.669
Orlando Sequera: Or well? Well, no, they didn't have the user the role, the role.

3055
05:04:38.350 --> 05:04:45.220
Orlando Sequera: The second element is the actual functionality. And the third element of our user story is the benefit.

3056
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:49.160
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3057
05:04:52.100 --> 05:04:53.820
Orlando Sequera: that's done.

3058
05:04:54.640 --> 05:04:58.790
Orlando Sequera: Can documentation be considered as deliverable? Yes.

3059
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:01.470
Orlando Sequera: A.

3060
05:05:02.770 --> 05:05:03.640
Orlando Sequera: But

3061
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:13.300
Orlando Sequera: it can be considered a deliverable. Yeah, it can be. At least it is a deliverable documentation. But it's mostly about the functionality that it's been built

3062
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:19.759
Orlando Sequera: for the customer. The the project delivers it, the actual functionality that is being built.

3063
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:23.740
Orlando Sequera: or throughout your project life cycle.

3064
05:05:25.980 --> 05:05:28.070
Orlando Sequera: Another question

3065
05:05:33.340 --> 05:05:37.199
Orlando Sequera: in a habit approach: how does the agile

3066
05:05:42.450 --> 05:05:44.850
Orlando Sequera: process map to waterfall.

3067
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:49.960
Orlando Sequera: especially when the software output needs to be tested in on hardware.

3068
05:05:50.540 --> 05:05:51.480
Orlando Sequera: and

3069
05:05:51.590 --> 05:06:00.280
Orlando Sequera: that's not really the actual combination you areas of your project. As I mentioned before, the procurement for the procurement.

3070
05:06:00.360 --> 05:06:12.680
Orlando Sequera: a aspect when you're working with third party vendors, and you're creating You're writing contracts and agreements with your vendors. You can use a a predictive approach for that.

3071
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:31.850
Orlando Sequera: But the development piece of your project, you can follow an agile approach. That's kind of what we mean by hybrid. That's an example, right? As an example for different areas for some areas of your project. You can use an ideal approach for some areas with your project. You can use a predictive approach. That's what we mean by hybrid.

3072
05:06:33.150 --> 05:06:34.760
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3073
05:06:39.770 --> 05:06:53.629
Orlando Sequera: Can you give us an example for plan? Driven? Yes. Construction building the house. And can you give us an example for change? Riven Absolutely. A developing a mobile app to compete with Whatsapp. That will be an example for that.

3074
05:06:55.000 --> 05:06:56.770
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be changing a lot.

3075
05:06:56.810 --> 05:07:02.050
Orlando Sequera: Our product owners generate the sponsor champion, not necessarily a product owner is someone that is

3076
05:07:02.340 --> 05:07:03.650
Orlando Sequera: a

3077
05:07:03.890 --> 05:07:07.719
Orlando Sequera: think of it as a super user that is very familiar with the

3078
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:11.040
Orlando Sequera: functionality that needs to be built, and if

3079
05:07:11.100 --> 05:07:18.849
Orlando Sequera: going to be the voice of the stakeholders is that liaison? Someone that is very familiar with the scope is this tour of this code?

3080
05:07:20.120 --> 05:07:22.729
Orlando Sequera: Is there a break coming up? Yes.

3081
05:07:29.940 --> 05:07:32.379
Orlando Sequera: what is the key difference between project

3082
05:07:32.520 --> 05:07:35.670
Orlando Sequera: for like cycle per like cycle is?

3083
05:07:35.890 --> 05:07:38.920
Orlando Sequera: And remember what we said it's about.

3084
05:07:39.280 --> 05:07:52.969
Orlando Sequera: They start an introduction of a product all the way through the retirement of the product. But within that life cycle which can be very long, you can have multiple projects in between. So it's an integration aspect.

3085
05:07:53.040 --> 05:07:57.639
Orlando Sequera: But it's totally different from from the project Management life cycle.

3086
05:08:08.690 --> 05:08:12.570
Orlando Sequera: Okay, all right. We're gonna take our

3087
05:08:12.890 --> 05:08:16.489
Orlando Sequera: a next break. We're going to be

3088
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:18.990
Orlando Sequera: back in 10 min and

3089
05:08:20.690 --> 05:08:23.379
Orlando Sequera: and enjoy your break.

3090
05:08:23.460 --> 05:08:26.369
Orlando Sequera: So thank you very much, everyone. We'll be back in 10 min.

3091
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:40.380
Orlando Sequera: Welcome back everyone. Hopefully.

3092
05:08:44.130 --> 05:08:47.960
Orlando Sequera: Yeah. Time to recharge and enjoy your break.

3093
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:51.089
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with our class.

3094
05:08:54.130 --> 05:08:55.570
Orlando Sequera: AIM

3095
05:08:58.000 --> 05:08:59.620
Orlando Sequera: we to get caught up.

3096
05:09:00.480 --> 05:09:03.769
Orlando Sequera: We only have a handful of questions Content related

3097
05:09:05.300 --> 05:09:09.590
Orlando Sequera: that I would like to address before we continue.

3098
05:09:10.180 --> 05:09:13.639
Orlando Sequera: The first one is, what is the success rate of change-driven approach?

3099
05:09:14.440 --> 05:09:15.530
Orlando Sequera: It's

3100
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:21.340
Orlando Sequera: a better framework, I will recommend you you. You can review

3101
05:09:21.650 --> 05:09:31.109
Orlando Sequera: publications by project management, by the program Management Institute, like the pulse of the profession that can help you with those statistics that is not really in scope for the exam.

3102
05:09:31.200 --> 05:09:33.789
Orlando Sequera: but by all means go to pmi.org

3103
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:36.170
Orlando Sequera: review the

3104
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:38.750
Orlando Sequera: I will say the polls of the profession.

3105
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:40.290
Orlando Sequera: 22,

3106
05:09:40.540 --> 05:09:48.910
Orlando Sequera: that's the latest one, and you might. You might find some statistics on that, but that's really not in scope

3107
05:09:49.110 --> 05:09:58.460
Orlando Sequera: for the Pmp. Example. It's the best approach for situations in which there are multiple changes in a high level of complexity.

3108
05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:02.300
Orlando Sequera: A.

3109
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:07.010
Orlando Sequera: There's another question in the Q. And a give an example of a product

3110
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:09.659
Orlando Sequera: compared to a project, so

3111
05:10:09.700 --> 05:10:12.820
Orlando Sequera: they are different, but they also.

3112
05:10:13.930 --> 05:10:29.810
Orlando Sequera: So you're mentioning the new road, they when it comes to product right. You have to look at functionality. Think, for example, your your smartphone, right, whether you have an iphone or an Android, or any other type of phone

3113
05:10:30.560 --> 05:10:36.100
Orlando Sequera: for product. It's about functionality, the memory that you have in your

3114
05:10:36.160 --> 05:10:49.260
Orlando Sequera: the processor that you have in your phone, the memory camera that's product specification, that that that to produce that product there is a life cycle that goes all the way from

3115
05:10:49.790 --> 05:11:07.569
Orlando Sequera: the design of the product of that product all the way through the retirement or decline of that product. Right? So you gotta look at functionality or or look at the highway from that perspective. How many links you have? How many they are you using concrete or using as phone?

3116
05:11:07.580 --> 05:11:25.629
Orlando Sequera: I i'm not a construction project manager. So please forgive me if I if I say something that of a a out of line. But if, when it comes to product, look at functionality at actual, it's about functionality, it's about specifications of the actual product. But the project.

3117
05:11:25.660 --> 05:11:33.980
Orlando Sequera: if they work, it combines way much more than just that functionality. It combines a multiple

3118
05:11:34.540 --> 05:11:37.450
Orlando Sequera: factors, multiple areas that we have to

3119
05:11:38.520 --> 05:11:44.739
Orlando Sequera: that we have to follow a systematic approach that we have to follow in order to produce that

3120
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:59.139
Orlando Sequera: a that final product, right, a all those different activities or tasks that we have to complete and multiple areas that we have to track and work on systematically to produce that final product. And

3121
05:11:59.580 --> 05:12:11.289
Orlando Sequera: in order to develop the life cycle of a product is way way much more long time than the one of an actual. Let me go back to that slide for a second to explain that

3122
05:12:11.340 --> 05:12:17.099
Orlando Sequera: it's usually way much more longer than the life cycle of

3123
05:12:19.610 --> 05:12:23.570
Orlando Sequera: a project. And this slide i'm looking for it

3124
05:12:24.500 --> 05:12:26.139
Orlando Sequera: and remember which slide.

3125
05:12:26.300 --> 05:12:27.790
Orlando Sequera: but I think it's

3126
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:30.680
Orlando Sequera: is actually

3127
05:12:33.530 --> 05:12:35.710
Orlando Sequera: oh, a little bit back.

3128
05:12:35.850 --> 05:12:40.609
Orlando Sequera: It's right here. Yeah, this one. So you see multiple projects just to create

3129
05:12:40.710 --> 05:12:41.780
Orlando Sequera: one

3130
05:12:41.830 --> 05:12:43.050
Orlando Sequera: a

3131
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:46.850
Orlando Sequera: just to cover the entire life cycle of a product. This is

3132
05:12:46.880 --> 05:12:50.669
Orlando Sequera: this is a private life cycle. But we have multiple projects just to

3133
05:12:50.750 --> 05:12:52.260
Orlando Sequera: just

3134
05:12:52.400 --> 05:12:54.790
Orlando Sequera: for the product life cycle. Right?

3135
05:12:55.410 --> 05:12:58.999
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So it's an integration point. That's what I was trying to

3136
05:12:59.140 --> 05:13:00.239
Orlando Sequera: to point out.

3137
05:13:01.050 --> 05:13:05.829
Orlando Sequera: But look at functionality. You gotta look at functionality specifications that's product

3138
05:13:05.890 --> 05:13:18.329
Orlando Sequera: life cycle. But a for project project life cycle is is different, and what is in scope for your Pmp. Xm. Is going to be project life cycle.

3139
05:13:20.220 --> 05:13:21.090
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3140
05:13:21.710 --> 05:13:25.209
Orlando Sequera: And we're going to go back to where we were.

3141
05:13:32.790 --> 05:13:33.770
Okay.

3142
05:13:34.100 --> 05:13:35.710
Oh.

3143
05:13:41.230 --> 05:13:59.190
Orlando Sequera: okay, Can you walk us through an example of an adaptive project absolutely. They saw we're trying to develop a new streaming service, or we're trying that come to compete with Netflix. So we're trying to develop a new music application to compete with Pandora. We know what

3144
05:13:59.470 --> 05:14:07.670
Orlando Sequera: what the end goal is, but we don't know how to get there, so that's where we use. That's where following Nigel approach is going to be our best PET.

3145
05:14:13.870 --> 05:14:15.290
Okay.

3146
05:14:26.820 --> 05:14:34.400
Orlando Sequera: there is a general question that is not related to the content, but nonetheless. I'm going to answer it, because it's going to help all of you.

3147
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:43.979
Orlando Sequera: I, if I have older. Pmp. Story materials, books and practice tests from 2021

3148
05:14:44.570 --> 05:14:48.139
Orlando Sequera: before 2021. No, do not use that.

3149
05:14:48.810 --> 05:15:02.839
Orlando Sequera: It has to be aligned with the current version. The exam changed tremendously in 2,021 anything before 2,021. No, do not use that. It can be misguided. It was totally different. So use

3150
05:15:03.090 --> 05:15:09.280
Orlando Sequera: and you have it. You have it here with skills of you. Have it. Go to your resources. You have all the materials that you need

3151
05:15:09.360 --> 05:15:16.039
Orlando Sequera: to get ready for the Pmp. Example Anything before 2021. No, it's a in capitals. No.

3152
05:15:16.410 --> 05:15:17.550
Orlando Sequera: no, no, no.

3153
05:15:18.090 --> 05:15:18.900
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3154
05:15:20.600 --> 05:15:21.870
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

3155
05:15:21.940 --> 05:15:23.630
Orlando Sequera: A.

3156
05:15:27.800 --> 05:15:32.040
Orlando Sequera: If in a big project software development there are all 3. The project managers

3157
05:15:32.180 --> 05:15:36.710
Orlando Sequera: for the owner and scrum master how to differentiate responsibilities.

3158
05:15:38.160 --> 05:15:48.530
Orlando Sequera: What is mainly up to pragmatic. Well, you just tour the project you do. Your role is more enhanced than it's similar to the one of a scrum master. But the scrum master is more about

3159
05:15:48.630 --> 05:16:07.590
Orlando Sequera: a following best crum practices and coaching the team. But a project manager is going to be in charge of the scope which are in charge, not the scope that is the pro owner in charge of the budget in charge of the the schedule. So it's more involved. Okay, it's more involved.

3160
05:16:07.630 --> 05:16:12.879
Orlando Sequera: The product owner is going to be in charge of the scope. The scrum master is going to be a

3161
05:16:13.340 --> 05:16:20.800
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be a servant leader to the scrum team. But the pro manager has more responsibilities than just the team

3162
05:16:21.020 --> 05:16:23.300
Orlando Sequera: as we have been covering so far.

3163
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:24.960
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3164
05:16:25.350 --> 05:16:26.290
Orlando Sequera: A

3165
05:16:27.840 --> 05:16:30.450
Orlando Sequera: Any other questions.

3166
05:16:47.140 --> 05:16:50.129
Orlando Sequera: All right. We're going to continue with the content.

3167
05:16:54.760 --> 05:16:58.610
Orlando Sequera: Please keep the questions mostly related to the content as much as possible.

3168
05:16:59.080 --> 05:17:00.430
The

3169
05:17:01.950 --> 05:17:04.859
Orlando Sequera: our per managers also stakeholders.

3170
05:17:05.170 --> 05:17:06.210
Orlando Sequera: yes.

3171
05:17:06.700 --> 05:17:10.160
Orlando Sequera: and or sponsors of a project. They can also be

3172
05:17:10.710 --> 05:17:12.769
Orlando Sequera: Yeah, there's stakeholders

3173
05:17:13.270 --> 05:17:14.240
Orlando Sequera: dip there.

3174
05:17:19.970 --> 05:17:22.210
Orlando Sequera: Simple project of building a house.

3175
05:17:22.250 --> 05:17:27.499
Orlando Sequera: mostly predictive. Start start, stop next step. Serious builds, but where a lot of

3176
05:17:27.740 --> 05:17:33.839
Orlando Sequera: aspects are done in parallel like plumbing and wearing. But you still need to follow a sequence and coordinate that

3177
05:17:34.770 --> 05:17:41.159
Orlando Sequera: a an example of agile applied to construction. And when I used your question to pig it back, to explain that

3178
05:17:41.900 --> 05:17:43.180
Orlando Sequera: it wouldn't be

3179
05:17:43.760 --> 05:17:47.490
Orlando Sequera: necessarily plumbing and wiring, because you have to coordinate that, and you

3180
05:17:47.520 --> 05:17:53.890
Orlando Sequera: have to define those activities really well in sequence them You're still following a predictive approach, but it

3181
05:17:54.130 --> 05:18:12.060
Orlando Sequera: in construction. Whenever construction companies want to test a new material, many of them are using an agile approach just for that aspect, for a and the research and development. So it is possible to use a agile or adaptive even in construction.

3182
05:18:17.240 --> 05:18:24.950
Orlando Sequera: Hmm. So we'll be safe to say that the various fres will be separate from. Not necessarily. You can combine. Not necessarily, not necessarily.

3183
05:18:26.440 --> 05:18:32.289
Orlando Sequera: You can combine that functionality producing that functionality that is project manager. For that.

3184
05:18:34.410 --> 05:18:36.859
Orlando Sequera: If I understand the question correctly, that is

3185
05:18:39.950 --> 05:18:45.930
Orlando Sequera: how long is the project life cycle for something like the development of the new iphone. Well, with the pain. So that's a

3186
05:18:46.060 --> 05:18:52.430
Orlando Sequera: It depends on the scope, right? What? What function I do? You need to understand the functionality that you're trying to produce.

3187
05:18:52.710 --> 05:19:02.179
Orlando Sequera: It's hard to can just do that out of thin air. Right? You need to know what you're working on, so you can. Then they understand how long it's going to take you to build it.

3188
05:19:07.930 --> 05:19:09.020
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3189
05:19:13.440 --> 05:19:22.450
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the in the Q. A. Do you think an adaptive project is also related to a more relaxed risk. Tolerance? No, no, not necessarily.

3190
05:19:22.640 --> 05:19:25.610
Orlando Sequera: The only difference is, it's not more relaxed.

3191
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:31.490
Orlando Sequera: We try to address uncertainties in agile projects. Early in the project

3192
05:19:32.200 --> 05:19:33.890
Orlando Sequera: as early as possible.

3193
05:19:34.330 --> 05:19:36.050
Orlando Sequera: boarding a predictive

3194
05:19:36.080 --> 05:19:43.629
Orlando Sequera: a approach, we do it as more information becomes available, but it's not about being more relaxed If

3195
05:19:45.720 --> 05:19:49.440
Orlando Sequera: we try to address, risk as early as possible in adaptive

3196
05:19:49.970 --> 05:19:52.549
Orlando Sequera: in in the in aaptive or agile

3197
05:19:52.880 --> 05:19:54.330
approaches.

3198
05:20:02.970 --> 05:20:04.350
All right.

3199
05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:08.509
Orlando Sequera: all right. I think we're getting cut off

3200
05:20:08.820 --> 05:20:10.390
Orlando Sequera: with the questions.

3201
05:20:11.490 --> 05:20:12.420
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3202
05:20:14.300 --> 05:20:15.250
Orlando Sequera: A few

3203
05:20:15.720 --> 05:20:20.399
Orlando Sequera: guidance aspect when it comes to the development approaches.

3204
05:20:21.500 --> 05:20:29.930
Orlando Sequera: Now that we understand the different life cycles and the development approaches. We talked about the cadence, and we talked. We also talked about the

3205
05:20:30.850 --> 05:20:32.000
Orlando Sequera: the faces.

3206
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.970
Orlando Sequera: It.

3207
05:20:34.160 --> 05:20:38.600
Orlando Sequera: It's true that organizational governance has an impact in

3208
05:20:38.700 --> 05:20:44.530
Orlando Sequera: enterprise environmental factors that we have set before they're going to have a major.

3209
05:20:44.550 --> 05:20:47.160
Orlando Sequera: a a a major impact

3210
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:50.530
Orlando Sequera: on determining the life cycle of our project.

3211
05:20:50.580 --> 05:21:05.829
Orlando Sequera: You can understand what else might be possible. Remember that your main role as a project manager, your main job as a project manager is to ensure as much as possible. Project so a successful project outcome for your project

3212
05:21:06.190 --> 05:21:09.939
Orlando Sequera: A. And also when you are deciding the approach

3213
05:21:10.240 --> 05:21:29.560
Orlando Sequera: you need to work with the team. You need to consult the team and understand the process and comes of each approach for your specific situation, for your specific project that can help your team in focus on thinking whether a single delivery or a face or a face, one is better. Or

3214
05:21:29.570 --> 05:21:37.240
Orlando Sequera: if time boxing is gonna work like using iterations, for example, or sprint, or using a continuous flow, is gonna work.

3215
05:21:37.260 --> 05:21:38.890
Orlando Sequera: So there.

3216
05:21:39.050 --> 05:21:52.519
Orlando Sequera: by getting them involved in that discussion they're the ones that are going to be doing the work They shouldn't be decided by you as the project manager, do you? It's about collaboration, right? So this is another aspect that is going to

3217
05:21:52.670 --> 05:22:02.669
Orlando Sequera: that you need to take into account. You have to collaborate with your team members when in deciding the best development, approach the best cadence.

3218
05:22:02.720 --> 05:22:17.879
Orlando Sequera: then determine the actual, the best project life cycle and the faces. If we're going to use faces and answer a few questions, what about the unplanned work, or do we know all the work that we have to complete for the project. A.

3219
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:31.359
Orlando Sequera: How does the team prefer to work? What is the best cadence for our specific situation. Should it be a single delivery, or should it be a periodic delivery every 2 weeks, or should be? Should it be a single delivery?

3220
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:36.410
Orlando Sequera: What does the customer want? That's probably the 1 one of the most important ones

3221
05:22:36.520 --> 05:22:41.119
Orlando Sequera: It do. They want incremental value delivery, meaning that do

3222
05:22:41.290 --> 05:22:43.510
Orlando Sequera: It's a beneficial for them to get

3223
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:54.150
Orlando Sequera: partial functionality so they can start working with that functionality as early as possible. Or are they looking for a single delivery? What is our schedule.

3224
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:58.949
Orlando Sequera: Do we want to have a steady or building approach, or do we want a faster pace

3225
05:22:59.820 --> 05:23:02.180
Orlando Sequera: also? What is the risk? Appetite.

3226
05:23:02.330 --> 05:23:08.670
Orlando Sequera: a, or threshold, and our iteration so springs helpful in our situation.

3227
05:23:08.790 --> 05:23:12.630
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So we need to understand that as well.

3228
05:23:14.480 --> 05:23:15.450
Orlando Sequera: Also.

3229
05:23:18.720 --> 05:23:21.260
Orlando Sequera: in order to understand

3230
05:23:21.940 --> 05:23:27.779
Orlando Sequera: and determine the best approach for our project. There are some tools that can help you

3231
05:23:28.020 --> 05:23:29.070
Orlando Sequera: it.

3232
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:30.600
Orlando Sequera: Ralph Stacey

3233
05:23:30.990 --> 05:23:35.149
Orlando Sequera: is an author that came up with a stacy complexity model.

3234
05:23:35.340 --> 05:23:46.169
Orlando Sequera: and this is used in all kinds of contexts to understand the complexity of a thing in terms of the degree of certain of certainty about requirements.

3235
05:23:46.220 --> 05:23:48.520
Orlando Sequera: and also the technology

3236
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:52.569
Orlando Sequera: and knowledge available to complete the work.

3237
05:23:52.610 --> 05:24:05.849
Orlando Sequera: So Pmi made an adaptation of the Stacy complexity model that can help you, a. To understand which one is going to be your your best, your best bet. So

3238
05:24:07.320 --> 05:24:18.200
Orlando Sequera: are you. And when so, these are the 2 dimensions, right that you are evaluating in the when it comes to the complexity model. Your the first I mentioned is

3239
05:24:18.210 --> 05:24:28.460
Orlando Sequera: requirements in the y-axis, or the vertical access, and then you have technical capability. That is the second dimension in the horizontal access or the X

3240
05:24:28.480 --> 05:24:29.730
access.

3241
05:24:29.780 --> 05:24:42.830
Orlando Sequera: And then, if it's, if you're close to agreement when it comes to requirements and technical capability close to certainty, then it's a simple approach. You're it's a simple situation that you that you're navigating. And in this case

3242
05:24:42.970 --> 05:24:48.680
Orlando Sequera: a linear approach meaning predictive waterfall traditional works better here.

3243
05:24:48.900 --> 05:24:49.700
Orlando Sequera: But

3244
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:53.660
Orlando Sequera: if your technical capability and

3245
05:24:54.580 --> 05:25:01.530
Orlando Sequera: and your requirements, understanding is not close to an agreement, it's really far from agreement, it's complicated.

3246
05:25:01.560 --> 05:25:07.570
Orlando Sequera: This adaptive approach. This is where Agile works better, or if it's far from agreement

3247
05:25:07.590 --> 05:25:12.760
Orlando Sequera: and far from certainty. This is also when adaptive works better

3248
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:16.789
Orlando Sequera: or adjo. But if it's really

3249
05:25:17.230 --> 05:25:32.519
Orlando Sequera: far from agreement when it comes to requirements of far from certainly, when it comes to think of capability, that's pretty much a chaos, and that is fundamentally risky. Maybe we need. Do. We need to understand a little bit more, at least to know where we're going.

3250
05:25:32.560 --> 05:25:47.580
Orlando Sequera: and before we undertake a a project in that situation. So this is one tool that can help you to navigate a to determine which approach is the best for our specific situation.

3251
05:25:48.600 --> 05:25:49.830
Orlando Sequera: Another

3252
05:25:50.800 --> 05:25:54.390
Orlando Sequera: tool is what they call a suitability filter.

3253
05:25:54.580 --> 05:25:59.419
Orlando Sequera: and this can help. This tool can help the project team to consider whether a project

3254
05:25:59.550 --> 05:26:06.669
Orlando Sequera: A has characteristics that lend themselves towards a predictive, agile, or hybrid, or other, our

3255
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:12.199
Orlando Sequera: or or hybrid right? So you it you take into account multiple dimensions.

3256
05:26:12.280 --> 05:26:15.320
Orlando Sequera: A. If this is about a questioner

3257
05:26:15.820 --> 05:26:18.640
Orlando Sequera: that is going to ask questions about the culture

3258
05:26:18.670 --> 05:26:22.169
Orlando Sequera: of the organization. Do we have a supportive environment

3259
05:26:22.220 --> 05:26:25.270
Orlando Sequera: with buying for the approach and frost in the team

3260
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:34.219
Orlando Sequera: is, and then the next I mentioned it's going to be. The team is the team of a suitable size to be successful in adopting a job, yes or no.

3261
05:26:34.260 --> 05:26:41.120
Orlando Sequera: and and then do do the members have the necessary experience and access to business representatives to be successful?

3262
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:47.260
Orlando Sequera: A and the other dimension is the project? Do we have high rates of change?

3263
05:26:47.470 --> 05:26:53.989
Orlando Sequera: Yes or no? Is the is incremental delivery possible? How critical is the project? So based on this?

3264
05:26:54.020 --> 05:26:56.769
Orlando Sequera: A sort of bitter filter. You

3265
05:26:57.250 --> 05:27:04.409
Orlando Sequera: start connecting the dots in this radar chart, and the clusters of value around the center

3266
05:27:04.620 --> 05:27:07.990
Orlando Sequera: indicate a good fit for agile approaches.

3267
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:10.780
Orlando Sequera: The results around the outside

3268
05:27:10.870 --> 05:27:12.500
Orlando Sequera: indicate

3269
05:27:12.770 --> 05:27:20.410
Orlando Sequera: good result for a predictive approach. But if you have anything in the middle, and it it gives you the idea right. So anything here

3270
05:27:20.520 --> 05:27:21.930
Orlando Sequera: close to the center.

3271
05:27:21.950 --> 05:27:25.400
Orlando Sequera: The better idea to use agile for this particular situation.

3272
05:27:25.420 --> 05:27:28.910
Orlando Sequera: it seems to be a better idea to use agile or adaptive.

3273
05:27:29.050 --> 05:27:30.020
Orlando Sequera: If it's

3274
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:31.720
Orlando Sequera: outside of the center

3275
05:27:32.400 --> 05:27:41.390
Orlando Sequera: hybrid, it's gonna be your best bet. But if it's far out of the center, then going with a predictive approach is going to be your best bet. So you can use these tools.

3276
05:27:41.610 --> 05:27:45.929
Orlando Sequera: This is, explain in a little bit more detail in your

3277
05:27:45.990 --> 05:27:48.150
Orlando Sequera: agile right, this Guy.

3278
05:27:48.770 --> 05:27:49.420
Okay.

3279
05:27:49.810 --> 05:27:57.599
Orlando Sequera: but these are tools that can help you to determine which approach. Should I follow a adaptive or predictive or

3280
05:27:57.730 --> 05:27:58.530
Orlando Sequera: hybrid

3281
05:27:59.810 --> 05:28:01.190
Orlando Sequera: another tool

3282
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:03.329
Orlando Sequera: or or

3283
05:28:03.360 --> 05:28:06.190
Orlando Sequera: well, not really another 2, a.

3284
05:28:07.490 --> 05:28:08.969
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to

3285
05:28:09.800 --> 05:28:23.979
Orlando Sequera: iterative and incremental. And I have seen in this class there's a little bit of confusion. Iterative means that we do it multiple times, right? Iterative and in increments means that we're building pieces of functionally. One

3286
05:28:24.100 --> 05:28:27.720
Orlando Sequera: one piece at a time, one iteration at a time.

3287
05:28:28.160 --> 05:28:30.090
Orlando Sequera: Agile is both

3288
05:28:30.380 --> 05:28:34.619
Orlando Sequera: is is both iterative and incremental.

3289
05:28:34.730 --> 05:28:38.500
Orlando Sequera: Okay agile is both iterative and incremental.

3290
05:28:39.730 --> 05:28:44.250
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to incremental approach, we produce deliverable successfully

3291
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:53.550
Orlando Sequera: in pieces or modules, and we're adding functionally until the final deliverable contains the necessary and sufficient capability to be considered as complete.

3292
05:28:53.580 --> 05:29:03.509
Orlando Sequera: With an iterative approach, pure iterative approach, we focus on an initial simplified implementation, and then we build

3293
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:04.920
Orlando Sequera: over time

3294
05:29:05.170 --> 05:29:10.560
Orlando Sequera: progressively adopting the feature until the actual final delivery is complete.

3295
05:29:10.600 --> 05:29:12.890
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by iterative.

3296
05:29:13.440 --> 05:29:22.739
Orlando Sequera: combine the 2 incremental and iterative. And that's what agile is. That's what adaptive is. Okay. It's both

3297
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:25.019
Orlando Sequera: iterative and incremental.

3298
05:29:25.260 --> 05:29:28.210
Orlando Sequera: Again, hybrid is a combination of predictive

3299
05:29:28.240 --> 05:29:29.280
Orlando Sequera: and adaptive

3300
05:29:30.160 --> 05:29:31.150
Orlando Sequera: and

3301
05:29:31.280 --> 05:29:34.729
Orlando Sequera: predictive is not iterative and incremental? Okay.

3302
05:29:35.120 --> 05:29:49.310
Orlando Sequera: they're compatible with each other, as I mentioned before, it's not agile or or adaptive versus predictive or waterfall is agile and predictive, and then we can make some match. That's what we call hybrid. Okay.

3303
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:51.889
Orlando Sequera: and they can help you

3304
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:56.520
Orlando Sequera: depending on your depending on the situation that you are facing.

3305
05:29:58.050 --> 05:29:58.970
Orlando Sequera: Now.

3306
05:29:59.860 --> 05:30:04.430
Orlando Sequera: we are going to watch a video that is gonna help us to

3307
05:30:04.890 --> 05:30:15.610
Orlando Sequera: understand a little bit more about the iterative way of working. This is going to help us a little bit more to understand about the iterative way of working

3308
05:30:21.410 --> 05:30:22.680
the word iterate.

3309
05:30:22.830 --> 05:30:25.510
It comes from the Latin iterare.

3310
05:30:25.530 --> 05:30:27.350
meaning to repeat

3311
05:30:27.560 --> 05:30:31.649
Thus an iterative way of working repeats itself over and over.

3312
05:30:32.050 --> 05:30:34.460
optimizing itself each time it does

3313
05:30:34.690 --> 05:30:36.730
in an iterative process.

3314
05:30:36.770 --> 05:30:42.110
workflows into the product backlog from minimum business increments and from the release roadmap.

3315
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:46.440
The product backlog is where the team collects all the work flowing to the team.

3316
05:30:46.830 --> 05:30:49.790
The product owner prioritizes the product backlog

3317
05:30:49.970 --> 05:30:53.099
signaling to the team what work is the most important

3318
05:30:53.700 --> 05:31:01.020
At the start of each iteration the team pulls the work they plan to do from the product backlog into the iteration backlog.

3319
05:31:01.170 --> 05:31:02.810
This is a key point.

3320
05:31:02.940 --> 05:31:11.489
The team pulls the amount of work it thinks it can get done during the iteration, not the product owner, team manager, or stakeholders.

3321
05:31:11.940 --> 05:31:14.980
The iteration is the time box around the team's work.

3322
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:20.289
The team starts with the iteration planning and ends with the Iteration Review.

3323
05:31:20.680 --> 05:31:28.189
Agile teams usually choose between an iteration length of one to 4 weeks, with 2 weeks, being the most common choice

3324
05:31:28.650 --> 05:31:31.700
regularly. The team meets for a coordination meeting.

3325
05:31:32.060 --> 05:31:34.240
also called a stand up or scrum.

3326
05:31:34.500 --> 05:31:38.920
The stand-up helps the team coordinate and work in a quick and informal way.

3327
05:31:40.630 --> 05:31:43.430
The iteration of review ends the iteration.

3328
05:31:43.700 --> 05:31:46.610
This review has 2 parts. It reviewed.

3329
05:31:49.240 --> 05:31:55.979
use the product and solution built in the iteration and the process. How the team worked together.

3330
05:31:56.140 --> 05:31:57.699
and what got in their way

3331
05:31:58.280 --> 05:32:02.779
in the demo the team showcases, what they accomplished in the iteration

3332
05:32:02.940 --> 05:32:14.620
the demo focuses on value-delivered and feedback from stakeholders. In the retrospective the team takes time away from their busy schedule to reflect on how they work together in the iteration.

3333
05:32:15.260 --> 05:32:18.360
What aspects made them go faster and be successful.

3334
05:32:18.630 --> 05:32:21.550
What aspects got in their way of reaching their goals?

3335
05:32:21.820 --> 05:32:27.550
The team looks both internally inside the team and externally outside the team.

3336
05:32:27.880 --> 05:32:33.690
The team also lays out a plan to fix some of the points that got in their way during the next iteration.

3337
05:32:34.500 --> 05:32:36.380
When an iteration is complete.

3338
05:32:36.440 --> 05:32:45.039
We go back and start over with the iteration, planning and pulling work from product backlog into the iteration backlog. During the next planning

3339
05:32:45.760 --> 05:32:50.909
the agile iterative process contains a series of artifacts and ceremonies.

3340
05:32:51.340 --> 05:32:54.729
Artifacts are the objects produced within an iteration.

3341
05:32:54.920 --> 05:32:58.550
Ceremonies are activities that take place during an iteration.

3342
05:32:59.440 --> 05:33:06.229
For example, the product. Backlog is an artifact. It's the complete list of work required to create the product.

3343
05:33:06.430 --> 05:33:09.080
It collects all the work flowing to the team.

3344
05:33:09.700 --> 05:33:12.449
The iteration backlog is another artifact.

3345
05:33:12.630 --> 05:33:16.140
That's the list of work to be completed in the current iteration.

3346
05:33:16.180 --> 05:33:19.559
and it's supposed to be done in the order determined by the team.

3347
05:33:19.940 --> 05:33:23.300
There are a couple more artifacts that Aren't shown on our diagram

3348
05:33:24.890 --> 05:33:29.110
user stories capture a description of a feature from an end user perspective.

3349
05:33:29.450 --> 05:33:33.550
A user story describes the type of user what they want and why

3350
05:33:36.110 --> 05:33:41.799
a burn down chart is a graphic representation of how quickly the team is working through user stories

3351
05:33:42.080 --> 05:33:45.030
we actually touched on most of the ceremonies earlier.

3352
05:33:45.160 --> 05:33:47.379
These include iteration, planning

3353
05:33:47.500 --> 05:33:49.050
the coordination, meeting.

3354
05:33:49.200 --> 05:33:52.250
the iteration, demonstration, or demo

3355
05:33:52.410 --> 05:33:55.030
and the iteration retrospective

3356
05:33:56.650 --> 05:34:02.110
Orlando Sequera: right so a lot of information that was covering the video. Please don't feel overwhelmed.

3357
05:34:02.710 --> 05:34:12.270
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna be covering those ceremonies in more detail. So the pro backlog is coming in the next lesson and the iteration backlog as well. There are 2 containers.

3358
05:34:12.300 --> 05:34:17.159
Orlando Sequera: That's how we manage to go for our projects in. If we're following an agile approach.

3359
05:34:17.220 --> 05:34:25.629
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna talk in more detail about the user stories. I mentioned that briefly again. That's how we write requirements in agile the burn down chart.

3360
05:34:25.940 --> 05:34:28.489
Orlando Sequera: That's how we track project progress.

3361
05:34:28.710 --> 05:34:35.060
Orlando Sequera: That's gonna be in less than Number 5. Later in the week iteration planning there is planning in that

3362
05:34:35.330 --> 05:34:43.749
Orlando Sequera: a contrary to popular relief. There is planning magic. We're gonna talk about iteration planning that is, in the next lesson Lesson number 3.

3363
05:34:44.740 --> 05:34:50.440
Orlando Sequera: There are some ceremonies that were mentioned here the coordination meeting or a daily stand up

3364
05:34:51.300 --> 05:34:57.939
Orlando Sequera: or so daily scrum. We're gonna talk about that. The iteration demonstration. We're gonna talk about that in Lesson Number 5,

3365
05:34:58.020 --> 05:35:09.990
Orlando Sequera: and then the iteration retrospective. Where we go over a possible improvements or lessons learned that is content. That is part of Lesson number 4. So a lot of information here.

3366
05:35:10.000 --> 05:35:20.380
Orlando Sequera: But this is just a way for you to understand how it the iterative way of working works. And this is for specifically for agile. Okay.

3367
05:35:20.450 --> 05:35:23.590
Orlando Sequera: So don't let it overwhelm you. We're gonna break it down for you.

3368
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:32.340
Orlando Sequera: Now, we're going to talk about scrum.

3369
05:35:32.530 --> 05:35:36.559
Orlando Sequera: As I mentioned before, Scrum is just

3370
05:35:36.870 --> 05:35:43.570
Orlando Sequera: a flavor of at one of many do you have multiple flavors of at all? We have extreme programming.

3371
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:46.050
Orlando Sequera: If we have

3372
05:35:46.420 --> 05:35:48.400
Orlando Sequera: other

3373
05:35:48.960 --> 05:35:53.710
Orlando Sequera: approaches like safe, we have.

3374
05:35:54.560 --> 05:36:13.320
Orlando Sequera: We have Camden. We have other flavors out there that we can use for that we have for agile. It's not just a scrum. It's not all. Not all agile is crumb. It's. It's like chocolate, right? It's one flavor. It's probably the most popular one, but not necessarily. It's not the only one. Okay.

3375
05:36:14.190 --> 05:36:18.820
Orlando Sequera: it is a framework. It is not a methodology.

3376
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:27.119
Orlando Sequera: and you might be wondering. So what is the difference between a framework and a methodology? A methodology is prescriptive

3377
05:36:27.140 --> 05:36:43.540
Orlando Sequera: methodology. A methodology gives you step by step. This is what these are the actions that you need to take the steps that you need to follow in order to be agile. For example, No. In prescription, and prescriptive and agile don't, get along. That's like water and and oil. They don't mix

3378
05:36:43.590 --> 05:36:52.569
Orlando Sequera: so agile is not prescriptive. Scrum is not a it's not a methodology. It is a framework. It gives you suggestions

3379
05:36:52.700 --> 05:37:03.089
Orlando Sequera: on how the work can be organized, but you can always tailor. You can always tailor that with the end goal of maximizing value to your end, user

3380
05:37:03.700 --> 05:37:09.419
Orlando Sequera: scrum is gonna be implemented at the product development team level, and probably that's part of the secret

3381
05:37:09.480 --> 05:37:22.150
Orlando Sequera: off it's success. It's very easy to implement. You implemented at the team level is not like safe, for example, which is very popular nowadays, but it's implemented at the organizational level.

3382
05:37:22.210 --> 05:37:28.149
Orlando Sequera: But scrum, you can implement it at the team level, and it has mainly

3383
05:37:29.090 --> 05:37:30.550
Orlando Sequera: a 3 roles.

3384
05:37:30.960 --> 05:37:32.879
Orlando Sequera: Grum has 3 roles.

3385
05:37:33.060 --> 05:37:35.450
Orlando Sequera: They have a scrum master.

3386
05:37:36.100 --> 05:37:42.230
Orlando Sequera: which is an individual that is in charge of being a servant leader to the scrum team.

3387
05:37:42.550 --> 05:37:47.740
Orlando Sequera: and he's someone that is going to coach the team in.

3388
05:37:48.370 --> 05:37:50.160
Orlando Sequera: adopt him, and following

3389
05:37:50.280 --> 05:37:54.289
Orlando Sequera: agile approaches and scrum and scrum best practices.

3390
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:58.419
Orlando Sequera: And it's also going to coach the product owner, and it's also

3391
05:37:58.530 --> 05:38:07.839
Orlando Sequera: gonna coach all their stakeholders as needed. That is the scrum master role number 1 s role that you have in a scrum team is

3392
05:38:07.860 --> 05:38:11.400
Orlando Sequera: the product owner. The product owner is

3393
05:38:12.680 --> 05:38:16.270
Orlando Sequera: the liaison between the stakeholders

3394
05:38:16.420 --> 05:38:31.129
Orlando Sequera: and the business, and the project team is an in the is the steward of the scope of the project is in charge of that product backlog that we saw in the video that is going to be the actual

3395
05:38:31.360 --> 05:38:34.570
Orlando Sequera: product owner, someone that is very familiar with the scope. And it's

3396
05:38:34.930 --> 05:38:42.559
Orlando Sequera: Rep. Is this tour of that scope, making sure that the team is building the functionality that adds the most value

3397
05:38:42.580 --> 05:38:43.480
Orlando Sequera: to

3398
05:38:43.560 --> 05:38:45.430
Orlando Sequera: the business to the stakeholders.

3399
05:38:45.570 --> 05:38:48.579
Orlando Sequera: And the third row that we have in scrum is

3400
05:38:49.040 --> 05:38:51.459
Orlando Sequera: the people doing the work, the team members.

3401
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:52.970
Orlando Sequera: and it's also.

3402
05:38:53.240 --> 05:39:08.100
Orlando Sequera: They're also known as developers. To not necessarily software. Developers only can be any skill set that is needed to produce the work in the team. So those are the 3 rows and pay attention to something.

3403
05:39:08.170 --> 05:39:24.560
Orlando Sequera: Project Manager is not a role recognized by scrum. By no means. I'm. Saying that scrum teams cannot work with project managers. That is not what i'm saying. What i'm saying is that the only 3 roles that are recognized by scrum are

3404
05:39:25.120 --> 05:39:26.370
Orlando Sequera: scrum master.

3405
05:39:26.770 --> 05:39:27.660
Orlando Sequera: which

3406
05:39:27.820 --> 05:39:39.069
Orlando Sequera: in a way, it's very close. It's very similar. It's the closest one to the traditional project manager that we know what is what is different in some capacity.

3407
05:39:39.170 --> 05:39:43.929
Orlando Sequera: The second role that we have is the product owner, and the third one is

3408
05:39:44.080 --> 05:39:45.870
Orlando Sequera: the team members or

3409
05:39:46.130 --> 05:39:47.770
Orlando Sequera: developers. Okay.

3410
05:39:48.560 --> 05:39:50.010
Orlando Sequera: so keep that in mind

3411
05:39:51.240 --> 05:39:56.160
Orlando Sequera: and add your framework as we see here. This is important. It's about

3412
05:39:56.190 --> 05:40:15.310
Orlando Sequera: It's not about following the ceremonies that we're gonna see in a second, that is doing agile. They giving you best practices, right? They're giving you suggestions on how you can organize the work, how you can do the work. These are guidelines that they're giving you, that you can follow in order to be successful.

3413
05:40:15.320 --> 05:40:31.990
Orlando Sequera: E. E. For following an approach. That in which you're facing high complexity or multiple changes. It's going to help you in that regard. But it's way much more than just that. It's about the mindset right? We have

3414
05:40:32.000 --> 05:40:50.890
Orlando Sequera: It's not just following this ceremony that we're going to see. It's about the mindset. It's about being able to pave up, being able to have that we cannot have a successful, agile transformation if we are just using this ceremonies that we see here. But we are still a following

3415
05:40:51.630 --> 05:41:00.069
Orlando Sequera: that we we are still following a a a predictive mindset, this those 2 don't match it to for for this to work. There has to be a shift

3416
05:41:00.180 --> 05:41:11.470
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the mindset of that. That takes time. That takes time. That taste collaboration takes a involvement from opera management, a at multiple levels. Okay.

3417
05:41:11.840 --> 05:41:15.729
Orlando Sequera: let's talk about the ceremonies that we mentioned in our

3418
05:41:16.290 --> 05:41:20.769
Orlando Sequera: that we mentioned earlier in the class in in the video. Actually, we touch

3419
05:41:21.010 --> 05:41:24.690
Orlando Sequera: over those ceremonies. The first one is

3420
05:41:24.870 --> 05:41:26.160
Orlando Sequera: spring planning.

3421
05:41:27.340 --> 05:41:40.459
Orlando Sequera: and these ceremonies are going to help us to navigate that complexity, right? These are special meetings. Special ceremonies that we have in agro ceremony is a meeting basically the first one is spring planning.

3422
05:41:41.760 --> 05:41:48.760
Orlando Sequera: This is where this is about scope. This is about the work that we're going to be doing in a current sprint or iteration.

3423
05:41:49.040 --> 05:41:56.290
Orlando Sequera: The team is gonna get together with the product owner to understand. Okay, Miss Misses, for the owner, Mr. Per owner.

3424
05:41:56.590 --> 05:41:59.339
Orlando Sequera: we are going to take some.

3425
05:41:59.690 --> 05:42:11.080
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna take the items that that are at the top of the product backlog. Remember, the pro backlog is a running list that is always changing. But whatever is at the top.

3426
05:42:11.210 --> 05:42:15.899
Orlando Sequera: that means that those are the most important pieces of functionality that

3427
05:42:16.570 --> 05:42:18.679
Orlando Sequera: they that needs to be developed

3428
05:42:18.810 --> 05:42:20.050
Orlando Sequera: a first.

3429
05:42:20.090 --> 05:42:36.679
Orlando Sequera: So that's gonna signal to the product team that that that they're gonna be taking the fashion, right? That's what they're gonna be developing in their in their iterations. Okay, so they're gonna take always functionally from the top user stories. They're gonna take always user. Stories from the top.

3430
05:42:36.730 --> 05:42:47.969
Orlando Sequera: Okay, the scrum master is going to facilitate. But the team. This is where the team is gonna I. I'll give you an example. We're talking about the software Development Project for your

3431
05:42:48.670 --> 05:42:50.499
Orlando Sequera: for the accounting department.

3432
05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:52.410
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume that

3433
05:42:52.820 --> 05:42:53.929
Orlando Sequera: the team

3434
05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:56.190
Orlando Sequera: takes a user's story.

3435
05:42:56.410 --> 05:42:57.430
Orlando Sequera: which is

3436
05:42:58.050 --> 05:43:01.129
Orlando Sequera: as an administrator. I would like to develop.

3437
05:43:01.550 --> 05:43:15.510
Orlando Sequera: I as an administrator. I would like to be able to generate a monthly sales report, so that I can understand monthly sales for the organization at any given time. That is a user story. What happens in spring planning.

3438
05:43:15.730 --> 05:43:22.030
Orlando Sequera: This is where the team starts asking questions to the program owner. Okay, Mr. Perk, Owner misses for owner.

3439
05:43:22.420 --> 05:43:25.879
Orlando Sequera: What type of report are you looking for? Are you looking for

3440
05:43:26.390 --> 05:43:31.340
Orlando Sequera: Pdf. Report, or are you looking for an excel spreadsheet report?

3441
05:43:31.940 --> 05:43:34.229
Orlando Sequera: What field do you want to see in that report.

3442
05:43:35.110 --> 05:43:35.940
Orlando Sequera: What

3443
05:43:36.120 --> 05:43:38.019
Orlando Sequera: type of fun do you want to

3444
05:43:38.120 --> 05:43:41.279
Orlando Sequera: seeing that report? What type of

3445
05:43:42.380 --> 05:43:43.230
Orlando Sequera: it

3446
05:43:43.310 --> 05:43:46.390
Orlando Sequera: is this report feeding all the reports

3447
05:43:46.470 --> 05:43:49.300
Orlando Sequera: or our other reports fit in this report.

3448
05:43:49.760 --> 05:43:53.089
Orlando Sequera: What type of information do you want to display in this report?

3449
05:43:54.470 --> 05:43:55.310
Orlando Sequera: A:

3450
05:43:56.090 --> 05:44:06.900
Orlando Sequera: So you they start asking specific questions about the functionality? Okay, that they're trying to develop. That happens in spring client. And and this is also where the team

3451
05:44:06.930 --> 05:44:11.139
Orlando Sequera: it's going to estimate the level of effort associated with

3452
05:44:11.310 --> 05:44:20.449
Orlando Sequera: developing this function. This is where they're going to say, okay, this is a large, a endeavor. This is a large. This is a complex endeavor.

3453
05:44:21.050 --> 05:44:23.730
Orlando Sequera: They usually use the Fibonacci series

3454
05:44:23.780 --> 05:44:30.249
Orlando Sequera: with the user story points. We'll talk about that later. But this one is going to have a large number of points.

3455
05:44:30.330 --> 05:44:38.220
Orlando Sequera: I will venture to say that something like this monthly sales report is a 21 use a 21 user story point

3456
05:44:38.800 --> 05:44:40.580
Orlando Sequera: the estimation

3457
05:44:40.830 --> 05:44:56.979
Orlando Sequera: a probably depending on the number of team members that we have in the team. It might be the only feature that they're gonna be working on for that for the next 2 weeks. Assuming that we're working on iterations that last 2 weeks. Okay, that happens in spring planning. Then

3458
05:44:58.600 --> 05:45:01.040
Orlando Sequera: everybody makes a commitment. That

3459
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:07.629
Orlando Sequera: user story moves from the product backlog to a smaller container that we call the iteration backlog.

3460
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:12.779
Orlando Sequera: The team gets answers for all their questions, and then the work starts.

3461
05:45:12.870 --> 05:45:21.160
Orlando Sequera: But every day we're gonna have a sure and sweet meeting, the only for the team members and the scrum master to get

3462
05:45:21.800 --> 05:45:23.090
Orlando Sequera: coordination.

3463
05:45:23.120 --> 05:45:30.670
Orlando Sequera: It's not a status report. It's a coordination meeting, not a status meeting, and they're going to ask mainly 3 questions.

3464
05:45:30.800 --> 05:45:45.990
Orlando Sequera: They're gonna share with their teammates. This is what I worked on before. This is gonna what i'm gonna be working on today. And this is, and more importantly, if they have any roadblocks or any impediments that are preventing them from moving forward. They

3465
05:45:46.050 --> 05:45:53.789
Orlando Sequera: strum. Master has to address those impediments, has to remove those impediments. That's part of being a servant leader right

3466
05:45:54.090 --> 05:45:58.729
Orlando Sequera: at the end of the iteration. What's gonna happen is that spring review

3467
05:45:58.970 --> 05:46:01.789
Orlando Sequera: which in most cases includes a demo.

3468
05:46:01.960 --> 05:46:04.430
Orlando Sequera: They're going to showcase the functionality

3469
05:46:05.180 --> 05:46:18.149
Orlando Sequera: off that was built during the spring. This is where they're gonna get everyone together, all the stakeholders, not just the program owner. Everyone that needs to be invited. I will invite probably all the users that are going to be working with this

3470
05:46:18.180 --> 05:46:44.390
Orlando Sequera: with the accounting software. And this is where we're going to not using powerpoint slides. You're gonna run. You're gonna showcase to them. You're gonna log into the application and show them in real time how to run. This is where you need to go, Mr. User or missus. User you log in here. This is the information that you need to enter to generate a monthly sales report and voila! This is the

3471
05:46:44.400 --> 05:46:52.779
Orlando Sequera: Pdf report, with all the fields that you wanted to see. And this is what we build. That is the demo.

3472
05:46:53.610 --> 05:47:06.860
Orlando Sequera: This is where they, the user they, the stakeholders, the customers are gonna provide their feedback. Yes, that's what we're expecting. Oh, or they might say no. We we needed a an excel spreadsheet, not a Pdf.

3473
05:47:06.870 --> 05:47:24.269
Orlando Sequera: A format a report so that needs to be reworked. So they're going to either approve or reject. That has to be documented. You have to capture the sign off, and that's the end of that spring review, and what also happens at the end of each it rate

3474
05:47:24.400 --> 05:47:27.299
Orlando Sequera: and is the spring retrospective.

3475
05:47:27.790 --> 05:47:31.930
Orlando Sequera: but lessons learned. This is an opportunity for the team

3476
05:47:33.090 --> 05:47:34.770
Orlando Sequera: together to

3477
05:47:35.860 --> 05:47:40.299
Orlando Sequera: to self. Reflect on what, when will, what can be improved?

3478
05:47:40.340 --> 05:47:52.009
Orlando Sequera: And some of those improvements or lessons are are going, we're going to be able to incorporate them, to apply them in the Ver index iteration. So those are the 4 ceremonies that we have

3479
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:53.200
Orlando Sequera: force. Chrome

3480
05:47:54.610 --> 05:47:57.029
Orlando Sequera: is specifically for scrum.

3481
05:47:57.860 --> 05:47:58.540
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3482
05:47:58.760 --> 05:48:00.690
Orlando Sequera: or add your ceremonies.

3483
05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:10.990
Orlando Sequera: We have a product strategy meeting. This is where the port owner shares the provision. We have a the daily stand up.

3484
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:13.169
Orlando Sequera: This is a short and street meeting

3485
05:48:13.560 --> 05:48:17.839
Orlando Sequera: any work, most cases 15 min. Basically

3486
05:48:18.090 --> 05:48:21.530
Orlando Sequera: it's a coordination meeting for the team members. Mainly

3487
05:48:21.710 --> 05:48:37.829
Orlando Sequera: it to it doesn't have to necessarily be every day. But ideally it's a daily coordination that happens. Another ceremony that happens is backlog refinement. This is prioritizing the backlog, making sure that the functionality that's the most value is at the top.

3488
05:48:37.900 --> 05:48:51.320
Orlando Sequera: and they want to add less value is at the bottom. And then, with the project. Retrospective happens at the end to go over lessons, learn and possible improvements that we can incorporate in the future.

3489
05:48:51.570 --> 05:48:53.300
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that's

3490
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:54.710
Orlando Sequera: about

3491
05:48:54.750 --> 05:49:00.990
Orlando Sequera: ads of ceremonies, and we cover specifically for scrum very similar. But this is generic right for agile.

3492
05:49:03.580 --> 05:49:04.490
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3493
05:49:04.770 --> 05:49:08.010
Orlando Sequera: A little summary of what we have cover. So far

3494
05:49:09.190 --> 05:49:11.090
Orlando Sequera: we have been able to

3495
05:49:12.000 --> 05:49:17.149
Orlando Sequera: work on determining the appropriate project methodology, methods, and practices

3496
05:49:17.540 --> 05:49:22.140
Orlando Sequera: we have been able to go over a measuring.

3497
05:49:22.300 --> 05:49:25.540
Orlando Sequera: We have project needs complexity and magnitude.

3498
05:49:25.610 --> 05:49:28.029
Orlando Sequera: We also went over

3499
05:49:28.170 --> 05:49:34.809
Orlando Sequera: recommending project execution strategy, and also working, recommending a product, methodology, and approach. So

3500
05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:39.780
Orlando Sequera: that is the link to our exam content outline.

3501
05:49:39.920 --> 05:49:44.890
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to the end of Lesson number 2.

3502
05:49:45.020 --> 05:49:47.890
Orlando Sequera: So we are done with lessons, Number one and number 2.

3503
05:49:48.180 --> 05:49:50.640
Orlando Sequera: Now we're going to start with

3504
05:49:50.890 --> 05:49:52.530
Orlando Sequera: Lesson number 3,

3505
05:49:53.950 --> 05:49:56.579
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to start with planning.

3506
05:49:56.680 --> 05:49:58.010
Orlando Sequera: Start with planning

3507
05:50:00.300 --> 05:50:15.310
Orlando Sequera: a few learning objectives that we have with this lesson. We're just going to start with planning. But tomorrow we're going to continue in those covering those different areas. This is we're going to do a deeper dive of scope schedule resources brought that risk quality, and

3508
05:50:15.400 --> 05:50:20.030
Orlando Sequera: when all those different plans come together in either gray integration.

3509
05:50:20.510 --> 05:50:21.120
Okay.

3510
05:50:24.560 --> 05:50:26.300
Orlando Sequera: still learning objectives.

3511
05:50:26.970 --> 05:50:34.279
Orlando Sequera: we are going to be able to understand the importance of a project management plan a big umbrella that we have for project

3512
05:50:34.830 --> 05:50:37.630
Orlando Sequera: that covers all the different areas of a project

3513
05:50:37.860 --> 05:50:42.249
Orlando Sequera: we're going to understand, gonna provide an overview of scope, planning.

3514
05:50:42.840 --> 05:50:46.199
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the approach. Whether it is predictive or adaptive.

3515
05:50:46.380 --> 05:50:47.490
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna go.

3516
05:50:48.000 --> 05:50:55.859
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be able to provide an overview of scheduled planning, following both approaches. Whether it is predictive or adaptive.

3517
05:50:55.880 --> 05:51:10.969
Orlando Sequera: We're also gonna talk about resource planning for a project we briefly mentioned that before. But we're gonna do a deeper dive here. Remember, when we talk about resources, it's not only human resources. It's also physical resources. And also

3518
05:51:10.980 --> 05:51:16.380
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna go over the impact on procurement. We're also gonna go over broad jetting

3519
05:51:17.040 --> 05:51:21.679
Orlando Sequera: the importance of tailoring a budget. We're also going to talk about risk.

3520
05:51:21.970 --> 05:51:23.690
Orlando Sequera: We are going to.

3521
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:29.530
Orlando Sequera: They understand the possible responses to risk. We're going to be able to identify risks.

3522
05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:31.640
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be able to

3523
05:51:31.700 --> 05:51:46.729
Orlando Sequera: analyze risks from 2 perspectives, qualitative and quantitative. And then we're going to determine those responses. Then we're going to talk about quality. And last, but not least, we're going to talk about integration. All those different areas, all those different.

3524
05:51:46.810 --> 05:51:54.440
Orlando Sequera: the aspects of any project. They all come together under that big umbrella that we call the project Management plan

3525
05:51:54.690 --> 05:51:55.490
Orlando Sequera: all right

3526
05:51:56.640 --> 05:51:58.249
Orlando Sequera: without any further view.

3527
05:51:58.580 --> 05:52:00.969
Orlando Sequera: We're going to start talking about planning.

3528
05:52:03.010 --> 05:52:04.329
Orlando Sequera: We're going to

3529
05:52:04.590 --> 05:52:09.210
Orlando Sequera: talk about how projects project teams can plan for successful outcomes.

3530
05:52:09.510 --> 05:52:28.049
Orlando Sequera: using and following Pmi best practices, which is what we have to focus on for the Pmp. Xm. This something in this section, mostly for the most part, is related to the second domain in your exam Content outline, which by now you should know by heart, which is

3531
05:52:28.320 --> 05:52:29.330
Orlando Sequera: process

3532
05:52:29.390 --> 05:52:31.520
Orlando Sequera: memories, we have 3 domains

3533
05:52:31.540 --> 05:52:50.120
Orlando Sequera: people domain. That accounts for 42 Of the questions in your Pmp. Exam. Second domain is process. That accounts for 50 of the questions in your pmp. Exam. And the third domain is business environment which we started covering yesterday. That accounts for 8% of your Pmp. Exam.

3534
05:52:51.100 --> 05:52:51.980
Orlando Sequera: right?

3535
05:52:53.640 --> 05:52:57.060
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to planning. That starts

3536
05:52:57.210 --> 05:53:00.060
Orlando Sequera: with a project management plan

3537
05:53:02.280 --> 05:53:08.430
Orlando Sequera: every single project, regardless of the industry, regardless of the location, regardless of the sector.

3538
05:53:08.710 --> 05:53:14.450
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the development approach. Whether we're going with agile. Whether we're going with a

3539
05:53:14.860 --> 05:53:18.210
Orlando Sequera: predictive, we need a project management plan.

3540
05:53:18.570 --> 05:53:24.950
Orlando Sequera: The Project management plan is going to describe how the project is going to be executed.

3541
05:53:25.100 --> 05:53:29.220
Orlando Sequera: how the project is going to be monitored and control.

3542
05:53:29.250 --> 05:53:32.539
Orlando Sequera: and, more importantly, how the product is going to be closed.

3543
05:53:32.870 --> 05:53:34.239
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna be

3544
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:35.980
Orlando Sequera: a big umbrella

3545
05:53:36.380 --> 05:53:39.960
Orlando Sequera: that integrates and consolidates

3546
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:43.350
Orlando Sequera: all the subsidiary management plans

3547
05:53:43.500 --> 05:53:45.730
Orlando Sequera: and baselines from

3548
05:53:45.900 --> 05:53:48.110
Orlando Sequera: multiple areas of the project.

3549
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:50.290
Orlando Sequera: This is what's going to help us, too.

3550
05:53:50.940 --> 05:53:52.130
Orlando Sequera: A

3551
05:53:53.260 --> 05:53:58.929
Orlando Sequera: establish guard rails to maintain controls. That is how

3552
05:53:58.950 --> 05:54:00.530
Orlando Sequera: is helpful

3553
05:54:00.620 --> 05:54:05.240
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to adaptive or agile projects and also hybrid projects.

3554
05:54:05.520 --> 05:54:11.629
Orlando Sequera: It. It provides the structure of guardrails for the team's work, so they have some boundaries

3555
05:54:11.690 --> 05:54:16.610
Orlando Sequera: while they shape the vision of the product, together with the part owner.

3556
05:54:16.810 --> 05:54:18.370
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

3557
05:54:18.850 --> 05:54:21.260
Orlando Sequera: think of the project management plan

3558
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:24.550
Orlando Sequera: for those of you that remember that a

3559
05:54:25.410 --> 05:54:30.129
Orlando Sequera: before, whenever you bought a brand new car it used to come with an owners manual

3560
05:54:30.360 --> 05:54:43.619
Orlando Sequera: right. It was in the glove box, and you will have access to your owners Manual, and whenever you faced an issue, let's say that you're in your car dashboard a like came on check engine like.

3561
05:54:43.720 --> 05:54:44.930
Orlando Sequera: What do I do

3562
05:54:45.070 --> 05:54:57.590
Orlando Sequera: back in the day? Not now, but back in the day. Oh, check engine like what do I do, or I. We're we're live in the dashboard. I don't know what that is, so we will go and check the owners.

3563
05:54:57.690 --> 05:55:03.630
Orlando Sequera: They the user May, the car manual in this case, right? And okay, that is.

3564
05:55:03.710 --> 05:55:06.610
Orlando Sequera: that means this. And this is what we have to do.

3565
05:55:07.230 --> 05:55:16.530
Orlando Sequera: It's the same principle for the project management plan for, and the chapters or sections of that owners Guide or users Skype for your project

3566
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:24.029
Orlando Sequera: are going to be the different areas. You have one section for scope where section for budget, one section for schedule, one section for resources.

3567
05:55:24.070 --> 05:55:38.259
Orlando Sequera: one section for risk, one section for stakeholders from Section 4, a communication, and so on and so forth. So multiple sections. And each section is going to have a specific plan as that's what we call subsidiary plan.

3568
05:55:38.410 --> 05:55:47.689
Orlando Sequera: The risk management, plan, communication, management, plan and stakeholder engagement plan. Those are the subsidiary plans. We put them together, and that's how we can.

3569
05:55:47.710 --> 05:56:03.860
Orlando Sequera: That's how we can have this big umbrella or this, user this owners manual for our project. This is gonna help us. This is gonna help us tremendously. It is going to help us with. We think of when it comes to sports.

3570
05:56:05.150 --> 05:56:10.130
Orlando Sequera: a situation happens in a game. What do we do? We have a think of soccer or football.

3571
05:56:10.430 --> 05:56:18.609
Orlando Sequera: What do we do? Well, we go to the Rule book. So the rules are gonna be contained here in the plans. That's why we create the plans.

3572
05:56:18.620 --> 05:56:38.330
Orlando Sequera: Think of the Rule Book for your entire project that will help you to address situations when they happen. What do I do, I? We're not performing. We're over, run we we're we're experiencing cost over runs, and we're our schedule is delayed. What do I do? Or this new risk materialized?

3573
05:56:38.490 --> 05:56:40.090
Orlando Sequera: What do I do so.

3574
05:56:40.430 --> 05:56:58.620
Orlando Sequera: You don't have time to build the Rule book when you're facing the situation. That's why we do it at the beginning of our project. That's why we work on creating this project Management plan. This is going to be your go to research that it's going to help you to address those situations. You. You can't wait until you face them

3575
05:56:58.630 --> 05:57:13.260
Orlando Sequera: to create them. You do it at the beginning. Of course this is a living document as well. These plans can evolve and change as more information becomes available. But you need to start training them at the beginning in

3576
05:57:13.380 --> 05:57:16.669
Orlando Sequera: when you are when you're working on planning.

3577
05:57:17.400 --> 05:57:20.060
Orlando Sequera: and you're going to have to create

3578
05:57:20.900 --> 05:57:23.150
Orlando Sequera: a lot of project documentation.

3579
05:57:23.870 --> 05:57:30.670
Orlando Sequera: These project documents, combined with the plans. They're going to help you to navigate your

3580
05:57:30.690 --> 05:57:34.150
Orlando Sequera: projects to manage your projects. A.

3581
05:57:34.680 --> 05:57:37.159
Orlando Sequera: They're mainly part of

3582
05:57:37.270 --> 05:57:45.460
Orlando Sequera: predictive projects. We use a lot of it. Predictive Project management is heavier when it comes to documentation

3583
05:57:45.900 --> 05:57:58.890
Orlando Sequera: compared to agile projects. We still have documentation in edge of, but less is lightweight compared to predictive. Okay, but they are. They are actually a important

3584
05:57:59.150 --> 05:58:02.669
Orlando Sequera: important artifacts that we have to create that are going to help us to

3585
05:58:02.710 --> 05:58:04.149
Orlando Sequera: a navigate

3586
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:09.299
Orlando Sequera: our projects, to manage our projects in a more successful and systematic way.

3587
05:58:09.410 --> 05:58:10.760
Orlando Sequera: Okay, when we and

3588
05:58:10.920 --> 05:58:14.539
Orlando Sequera: they are living documents they're going to be changing. They're going to be evolving.

3589
05:58:14.890 --> 05:58:15.820
Orlando Sequera: and

3590
05:58:15.910 --> 05:58:25.359
Orlando Sequera: we have to make the corresponding changes. As I mentioned before. Probably the only artifact that doesn't really change is the project. Charter. We don't have to go back and change it.

3591
05:58:25.460 --> 05:58:33.650
Orlando Sequera: but the rest of the project, documentation and artifacts. They are all living documents, meaning that they need to be updated throughout the life cycle

3592
05:58:33.740 --> 05:58:34.980
Orlando Sequera: of your project.

3593
05:58:38.660 --> 05:58:50.739
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to the way we do. This planning is not just you as the project manager, doing it on your own ideally is through a collaboration

3594
05:58:50.930 --> 05:58:57.550
Orlando Sequera: work with the team. They're the ones that are gonna be doing the work reli. You should rely on the team work with the team.

3595
05:58:58.420 --> 05:59:16.520
Orlando Sequera: They should be a, and especially when it comes to a when it comes to agile. If you're following an adaptive approach, the team is self-organized and self manage. They're the ones that are going to be decide that that are going to decide how to do the work in sequence to work that becomes a black box for us

3596
05:59:16.630 --> 05:59:26.130
Orlando Sequera: If we're following an adaptive approach the team. Members decide that on their own. They only need to understand the what what type of functionality we're trying. We need.

3597
05:59:26.410 --> 05:59:30.280
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so in in adaptive. That is the case

3598
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:45.749
Orlando Sequera: predictive. We still work with them. But we have a little bit more same when it comes to sequencing, and i'll have a little bit more input than in an adaptive approach. Okay, but nonetheless, we still have to follow

3599
05:59:46.130 --> 05:59:48.820
Orlando Sequera: ideally a collaborative approach

3600
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:53.920
Orlando Sequera: a little bit about the planning across the life cycles

3601
05:59:54.270 --> 05:59:57.960
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the requirements. Specification

3602
05:59:59.290 --> 06:00:04.700
Orlando Sequera: in predictive. This has to be defined in specific terms before we start development.

3603
06:00:04.840 --> 06:00:21.850
Orlando Sequera: so we have to it. But when it comes, what if we're following a hybrid approach? This is going to be done periodically during delivery, multiple times, and this is in adaptive the same case. It's going to be frequently done during delivery, meaning that the requirements and the scope is going to be change.

3604
06:00:21.860 --> 06:00:35.749
Orlando Sequera: The outcome in predictive is usually one big bang at the end of the project. In hybrid it can be incremental and in adaptive at Agile it can be delivered after each iteration, right in increments

3605
06:00:35.940 --> 06:00:40.320
Orlando Sequera: based on the functionality that adds the most value to our customers

3606
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:42.370
Orlando Sequera: change. We type.

3607
06:00:42.400 --> 06:00:48.530
Orlando Sequera: We try to keep those change as constrained as possible in predictive. Hmm.

3608
06:00:48.560 --> 06:00:50.059
Orlando Sequera: Imagine, if you have.

3609
06:00:50.250 --> 06:00:58.490
Orlando Sequera: If you're building the house and you have to all this sorting, the the roof is already installed, and now they decided. Oh, we don't want that middle roof. We want to use Spanish style.

3610
06:00:58.670 --> 06:01:00.660
Orlando Sequera: Hmm. That's a major

3611
06:01:00.810 --> 06:01:02.820
Orlando Sequera: monkey range for your

3612
06:01:02.850 --> 06:01:03.990
Orlando Sequera: project, so

3613
06:01:04.050 --> 06:01:15.180
Orlando Sequera: that it we keep those a change constraint as much as possible, they in adaptive. No problem change can happen at any time. This can be incorporated in real time. Boarding hybrid

3614
06:01:15.220 --> 06:01:29.059
Orlando Sequera: at periodic intervals. Stakeholder involvement usually in predictive, is at specific milestones or significant events in your project in hybrid is regular, and you know that tip is

3615
06:01:29.320 --> 06:01:40.440
Orlando Sequera: even more involved is continuous involvement that you have that you need from your stakeholders, because that's how you navigate those changes, and when it comes to the approach of risk and and

3616
06:01:41.240 --> 06:01:42.380
Orlando Sequera: and cost

3617
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:50.069
Orlando Sequera: in predictive is very detailed. We have to determine our budget, we have to determine. We have to identify risks and have strategies in place.

3618
06:01:50.110 --> 06:02:01.439
Orlando Sequera: Hybrid is more of a progressive elaboration. As more information becomes available, we develop, we analyze, and and we start understanding our risks in our budget.

3619
06:02:01.780 --> 06:02:02.530
Orlando Sequera: and

3620
06:02:02.790 --> 06:02:08.629
Orlando Sequera: we're following an that an agile approach. This system controls of a risk and cost as

3621
06:02:08.850 --> 06:02:12.690
Orlando Sequera: requirements and constraints come to to the surface.

3622
06:02:13.450 --> 06:02:14.040
Okay.

3623
06:02:14.600 --> 06:02:15.630
Orlando Sequera: right.

3624
06:02:16.510 --> 06:02:17.680
Orlando Sequera: and that

3625
06:02:19.940 --> 06:02:20.830
Orlando Sequera: So

3626
06:02:21.000 --> 06:02:28.270
Orlando Sequera: this was just an introduction to planning we are. We have been able to cover a

3627
06:02:28.520 --> 06:02:36.949
Orlando Sequera: all the topics for today. This was just an introduction to how to differentiate the way we do, planning in

3628
06:02:37.210 --> 06:02:40.790
Orlando Sequera: adaptive projects, hybrid and predictive projects

3629
06:02:40.880 --> 06:02:42.190
Orlando Sequera: in

3630
06:02:42.260 --> 06:02:45.149
Orlando Sequera: basically to understand a little bit of the differences.

3631
06:02:45.810 --> 06:02:48.370
Orlando Sequera: please again before

3632
06:02:49.860 --> 06:02:51.890
Orlando Sequera: before we

3633
06:02:52.010 --> 06:02:56.950
Orlando Sequera: wrap up the session. We have a few minutes left. We're going to address questions

3634
06:02:57.070 --> 06:02:59.179
Orlando Sequera: we are going to.

3635
06:02:59.970 --> 06:03:06.299
Orlando Sequera: We need you. Please to fill out the survey. Thank you so much, by the way, for

3636
06:03:06.470 --> 06:03:08.680
Orlando Sequera: filling out the survey. Yesterday

3637
06:03:09.780 --> 06:03:12.040
Orlando Sequera: we got some feedback.

3638
06:03:12.370 --> 06:03:17.390
Orlando Sequera: and we are trying to be to incorporate the feedback to

3639
06:03:17.570 --> 06:03:21.799
Orlando Sequera: each session to make it better for you. Thank you so much.

3640
06:03:22.020 --> 06:03:24.830
Orlando Sequera: But please please please help us to

3641
06:03:27.560 --> 06:03:31.230
Orlando Sequera: help us by filling out the survey. Your feedback is great.

3642
06:03:31.540 --> 06:03:37.979
Orlando Sequera: and one aspect that you would like to that we would like to make sure that, you understand is the scale.

3643
06:03:38.630 --> 06:03:40.860
Orlando Sequera: A higher number is better.

3644
06:03:41.070 --> 06:03:42.060
Orlando Sequera: A

3645
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:46.889
Orlando Sequera: extremely likely, if you like the the the session today

3646
06:03:47.210 --> 06:03:56.269
Orlando Sequera: we it's a higher number. If you didn't like it so much, or the aspects, then it's a lower number. So please use the scale as intended. That's going to help us

3647
06:03:56.310 --> 06:04:13.159
Orlando Sequera: to make the adjustments that we need to make. But your input is very important, and remember that at the end of each session at the end of it each lesson you have vocabulary. This is important for you to get from you. You have this definitions.

3648
06:04:13.240 --> 06:04:20.480
Orlando Sequera: a the stakeholder definition, stakeholder analysis. Please make sure that you review that that is important

3649
06:04:20.510 --> 06:04:23.940
Orlando Sequera: for you to get ready for your Pmp. Exam.

3650
06:04:25.150 --> 06:04:27.329
Orlando Sequera: and without any further, do you?

3651
06:04:27.760 --> 06:04:29.589
Orlando Sequera: We are going to

3652
06:04:29.780 --> 06:04:32.680
Orlando Sequera: address questions that you might have

3653
06:04:33.500 --> 06:04:34.990
Orlando Sequera: a

3654
06:04:35.060 --> 06:04:38.050
Orlando Sequera: before we wrap up the session. You

3655
06:04:38.110 --> 06:04:48.720
Orlando Sequera: please stay locked in until at least 6 Pm. We still have 30 min, and in the room the the remaining minutes i'm going to address the questions

3656
06:04:49.240 --> 06:04:55.549
Orlando Sequera: that are in the chat in I'm. Sorry in the Q. A. Not in the chat in the Q. A.

3657
06:04:56.490 --> 06:05:03.450
Orlando Sequera: Please vote on the questions, and i'm going to address the ones that are, I have the most votes.

3658
06:05:04.920 --> 06:05:05.540
Orlando Sequera: Hmm.

3659
06:05:07.150 --> 06:05:10.080
Orlando Sequera: If the daily scrum is not a status meeting.

3660
06:05:10.980 --> 06:05:14.160
Orlando Sequera: what is the ceremony event where status is reported.

3661
06:05:16.790 --> 06:05:35.730
Orlando Sequera: It's a coordination meeting, but it is so involved. You're working with the team members, and they're working with the stakehold with the product owner on a daily basis. That pretty much you have constant stakeholder engagement. You, you don't need to wait until the status report like we do in predictive.

3662
06:05:35.760 --> 06:05:43.299
Orlando Sequera: We we're doing that coordination whenever it's needed. We're working hand in hand with our stakeholders. We don't want. We don't need to wait

3663
06:05:43.340 --> 06:05:47.510
Orlando Sequera: for a significant event in the project, like we do with predictive that

3664
06:05:47.640 --> 06:05:59.349
Orlando Sequera: we have constant interaction with our stakeholders represented by the product owner. But if we need to get in touch with an order stakeholder that that happens, do during the

3665
06:05:59.480 --> 06:06:02.230
Orlando Sequera: during the iteration. So

3666
06:06:02.280 --> 06:06:05.690
Orlando Sequera: we do not need to have a a status report

3667
06:06:05.710 --> 06:06:06.700
meeting.

3668
06:06:07.970 --> 06:06:10.329
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that happens through, continues

3669
06:06:10.410 --> 06:06:14.470
Orlando Sequera: a interaction continuous engagement with our stakeholders in agile.

3670
06:06:16.620 --> 06:06:21.309
Orlando Sequera: Another question: Will the other flavors of agile

3671
06:06:24.240 --> 06:06:25.110
Orlando Sequera: like

3672
06:06:25.380 --> 06:06:26.950
Orlando Sequera: Xp scrum?

3673
06:06:27.020 --> 06:06:28.680
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily.

3674
06:06:28.790 --> 06:06:32.040
Orlando Sequera: They might be mentioned, but mainly

3675
06:06:32.110 --> 06:06:35.300
Orlando Sequera: so. A couple of things. Thank you for that question.

3676
06:06:35.680 --> 06:06:42.569
Orlando Sequera: The Pmp. Exam. Is not an agile exam. You have the Acp agile, certified practitioner

3677
06:06:42.810 --> 06:06:53.710
Orlando Sequera: in that exam. Yes, they go over. They do a deeper dive on the different flavors. But here, mainly, you need to know that it is an approach that it is an adaptive approach.

3678
06:06:53.790 --> 06:06:59.570
Orlando Sequera: A. But you don't need to do a deeper dive on the different flavors of agile. So a

3679
06:07:00.350 --> 06:07:02.620
Orlando Sequera: my recommendation is

3680
06:07:02.780 --> 06:07:10.640
Orlando Sequera: number one. Take questions in test prep. The number 2 is to read the add on Practice Guide. This is an easy to read it.

3681
06:07:10.700 --> 06:07:26.230
Orlando Sequera: Give and take a 100 pages, and this covers all the agile that you need to know, for the Pmp. Exam. You need covers everything, and then some, a all the edges that you need to know. Do you need that? You need to know to be dangerous with the Pmp. Exam.

3682
06:07:27.420 --> 06:07:28.510
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3683
06:07:30.160 --> 06:07:31.760
Orlando Sequera: What else do we have.

3684
06:07:39.110 --> 06:07:57.029
Orlando Sequera: Could you give another example of a status meaning well that isn't predictive where we meet, and we're going to evaluate our performance against our plan? This is our schedule, and this is our plan. We we said that after 3 months we were gonna be able to complete

3685
06:07:57.040 --> 06:08:08.810
Orlando Sequera: is 75% of the house, and we have only completed 50 of the house. That's what's happening, or the or we are delayed. This is that that is a typical

3686
06:08:08.820 --> 06:08:17.230
Orlando Sequera: project status report meeting right, but the daily scrum is not that. It's just the coordination meeting short and suite where they go over

3687
06:08:17.950 --> 06:08:19.210
Orlando Sequera: sharing with

3688
06:08:19.230 --> 06:08:31.780
Orlando Sequera: their teammates. This is what I worked on yesterday. This is gonna what i'm gonna be working on today. And more importantly, if they have anything that is preventing them from doing their work. So 2 different things, 2 different things.

3689
06:08:36.290 --> 06:08:37.650
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3690
06:08:43.970 --> 06:08:46.190
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

3691
06:08:50.710 --> 06:09:00.250
Orlando Sequera: It in the daily scrum. What is the difference between a consideration of progress? You don't measure progress. You mentioned. What you were working on is the coordination for the team members.

3692
06:09:00.410 --> 06:09:09.979
Orlando Sequera: It's it's not about progress. So about what they worked on the day before what they're gonna be doing today, and if they have any roadblocks you're not measuring progress.

3693
06:09:10.040 --> 06:09:14.689
Orlando Sequera: The progress is going to be measured with the information that they enter

3694
06:09:15.200 --> 06:09:31.640
Orlando Sequera: in something that we call our information radiator. A Camb board is the type of information where they're going to be entering that on a daily basis. You don't need to have a special meeting to track project progress. Your team members are entering that information ideally on a daily basis.

3695
06:09:34.740 --> 06:09:36.130
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3696
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:50.249
Orlando Sequera: the scrum exists for produce industries that do not deal with it absolutely. It's used in marketing. It's using, even in construction. So yes.

3697
06:09:51.280 --> 06:09:52.760
Orlando Sequera: absolutely

3698
06:10:00.890 --> 06:10:02.030
Orlando Sequera: okay.

3699
06:10:03.850 --> 06:10:05.789
Orlando Sequera: I that.

3700
06:10:10.320 --> 06:10:20.509
Orlando Sequera: So sorry if I miss this. But what is the difference between a status meeting and a daily scrum? Is it Shorter note is the focus of the meeting. You don't go over project status in the Daily Scrum

3701
06:10:20.680 --> 06:10:33.369
Orlando Sequera: do. It is a coordination meeting again for the team members to share with the other team members. This is what I worked on before the day before. This is gonna what I'm gonna be working on today.

3702
06:10:33.460 --> 06:10:34.310
Orlando Sequera: and

3703
06:10:34.420 --> 06:10:49.670
Orlando Sequera: these are the roadblocks or impediments that are preventing me the that are preventing me from completing my work. That's what happens in a daily Stand up. A pric status meeting is you go way. Do you go over project progress?

3704
06:10:49.730 --> 06:10:52.610
Orlando Sequera: That's what we do in

3705
06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:55.699
Orlando Sequera: and in predictive project management.

3706
06:10:56.110 --> 06:10:57.130
Orlando Sequera: right?

3707
06:10:59.560 --> 06:11:03.320
Orlando Sequera: And a project manager use a consultant help for

3708
06:11:04.150 --> 06:11:06.199
Orlando Sequera: free change communication

3709
06:11:07.330 --> 06:11:08.380
A.

3710
06:11:10.790 --> 06:11:12.789
Orlando Sequera: You should be able to determine

3711
06:11:12.940 --> 06:11:18.890
Orlando Sequera: to perform the stakeholder communication analysis, and you should be doing that on your own. You shouldn't

3712
06:11:18.940 --> 06:11:21.540
Orlando Sequera: me help from someone from the outside.

3713
06:11:21.880 --> 06:11:23.220
Orlando Sequera: With your

3714
06:11:23.740 --> 06:11:28.870
Orlando Sequera: With the communication aspect of your project, you should be able to do that as the project manager on your own.

3715
06:11:29.430 --> 06:11:31.939
Orlando Sequera: If I understand the question correctly. That is

3716
06:11:34.790 --> 06:11:37.100
Orlando Sequera: okay

3717
06:11:38.470 --> 06:11:45.829
Orlando Sequera: in the suitability filter. So we read each category and a scale to one to 10, and then connect those dots to make that graphic. Yes.

3718
06:11:48.120 --> 06:11:52.099
Orlando Sequera: when asking for a sophisticated report, Where is that?

3719
06:11:52.890 --> 06:11:53.690
It looks?

3720
06:12:02.320 --> 06:12:04.350
Orlando Sequera: We're standing for documented.

3721
06:12:04.430 --> 06:12:09.370
Orlando Sequera: It depends on what report you're referring to. You will need to provide more context to your question.

3722
06:12:10.500 --> 06:12:13.790
Orlando Sequera: But you should document those those reports.

3723
06:12:14.540 --> 06:12:15.110
Yeah.

3724
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:21.300
Orlando Sequera: the quest you had earlier

3725
06:12:27.360 --> 06:12:33.010
Orlando Sequera: the quest you had earlier. Is that an indicative of one of the type of questions that will be in the Exam. Nope.

3726
06:12:33.060 --> 06:12:35.640
Orlando Sequera: No, no, no, no; that is just to

3727
06:12:35.720 --> 06:12:38.040
Orlando Sequera: validate your knowledge, your

3728
06:12:38.400 --> 06:12:42.680
Orlando Sequera: If you want to get exposed to the type of questions, go to test, prep.

3729
06:12:42.700 --> 06:12:44.140
Orlando Sequera: Go to test prep.

3730
06:12:44.170 --> 06:12:44.870
Okay.

3731
06:12:45.050 --> 06:12:48.580
Orlando Sequera: go to test prep and take practice questions.

3732
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:51.820
Orlando Sequera: A.

3733
06:12:52.550 --> 06:13:12.289
Orlando Sequera: I'm sorry I means we can. We find the add of Practice Guide. I am not sure if it's on the resources i'm going to defer to the moderators. I'm. 100% sure. But if you're a member of Pmi, you can download a free Pdf version of the other practice guide it's one of the benefits that you have as a member of the Project Management Institute.

3734
06:13:13.780 --> 06:13:14.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3735
06:13:16.130 --> 06:13:16.830
And

3736
06:13:22.140 --> 06:13:23.930
Orlando Sequera: what else? What else?

3737
06:13:32.160 --> 06:13:36.209
Orlando Sequera: General license specialism? T-shaped people are the same. Yes.

3738
06:13:40.710 --> 06:13:47.499
Orlando Sequera: 6 Sigma is about quality. Is not another flavor of agile. By the way, I think I missed that question before.

3739
06:14:17.460 --> 06:14:24.020
Orlando Sequera: Are all issues, risks and doing Nope issues and risk of 2 different things. We're going to address that when we get to risk

3740
06:14:33.880 --> 06:14:39.490
Orlando Sequera: 6 segment. Yeah, it's part of quality. It's gonna be briefly mentioned, but definitely not.

3741
06:14:39.730 --> 06:14:41.990
Orlando Sequera: That's its own discipline

3742
06:14:42.880 --> 06:14:43.980
Orlando Sequera: on its own.

3743
06:14:44.030 --> 06:14:45.609
Orlando Sequera: but it's part of quality.

3744
06:14:46.880 --> 06:14:54.419
Orlando Sequera: A is the agile guide in the resources I will defer to the moderators. I think it is I'm. Not 100% sure.

3745
06:14:58.380 --> 06:15:04.699
Orlando Sequera: Besides the practice Exam. And the book. Are there any other online resources. You have everything that you need under the resources Tab.

3746
06:15:04.780 --> 06:15:07.399
Orlando Sequera: to be successful. This is official content.

3747
06:15:07.500 --> 06:15:17.360
Orlando Sequera: Do you have test? Prep. You have all the resources that you need a in precipit, or if your number CPU, so you can go to Github. You have everything that you need.

3748
06:15:22.170 --> 06:15:26.540
Orlando Sequera: Can you please read the entire question. I'm trying. I'm doing my best my apologies.

3749
06:15:29.610 --> 06:15:36.779
Orlando Sequera: He's chaos even worth taking upon. Possibly not possibly not. But that is up to the decision makers to

3750
06:15:37.180 --> 06:15:38.610
Orlando Sequera: for them to decide.

3751
06:15:46.910 --> 06:15:52.710
Orlando Sequera: If the daily scrum is not a status meeting, what is it? It is a coordination meeting for the projecting members.

3752
06:15:53.020 --> 06:15:59.369
Orlando Sequera: It's the spring review of status. I mean it's closer to the traditional status meaning, but it's about scope only about scope.

3753
06:16:00.900 --> 06:16:03.820
Orlando Sequera: what we build, and we showcase what we built.

3754
06:16:20.500 --> 06:16:24.660
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between a communications match and plan and a communication model

3755
06:16:25.400 --> 06:16:32.949
Orlando Sequera: communication model is how the communication actually happens. The communication management plan is the strategy that you're gonna follow in your project

3756
06:16:33.100 --> 06:16:38.420
Orlando Sequera: to address project communications. It's a strategy aspect that will be the different

3757
06:16:39.150 --> 06:16:45.109
Orlando Sequera: Umhm. The model is, as you said the diagram on how the communication occurs. Correct.

3758
06:16:54.270 --> 06:17:00.519
Orlando Sequera: Could you show an example of user stories? We're gonna talk about them later in the class? We just had an overview introduction

3759
06:17:00.680 --> 06:17:01.500
Orlando Sequera: to

3760
06:17:02.560 --> 06:17:03.770
Orlando Sequera: to that.

3761
06:17:04.440 --> 06:17:09.440
Orlando Sequera: A. I may stand for the racing racing matrix. Is.

3762
06:17:11.580 --> 06:17:13.960
Orlando Sequera: It's an artifact that we create that

3763
06:17:14.200 --> 06:17:19.250
Orlando Sequera: States who's responsible for each task who needs to be consulted, who needs to be informed.

3764
06:17:19.650 --> 06:17:21.600
Orlando Sequera: and and who is accountable.

3765
06:17:21.690 --> 06:17:22.480
Orlando Sequera: That

3766
06:17:22.780 --> 06:17:28.719
Orlando Sequera: helps everyone to be on the same page, on the work that needs to be done. That's what they're racing. Matrix is.

3767
06:17:52.200 --> 06:17:57.530
Orlando Sequera: Can the brick sponsor join the daily scrum? Yes, but ideally should be a silent participant.

3768
06:18:03.550 --> 06:18:05.640
Orlando Sequera: We went over 6, Sigma.

3769
06:18:31.100 --> 06:18:38.220
Orlando Sequera: Are the features done during the pro planning or use of stores? Don't. Know before that before that that's that happens before

3770
06:18:43.540 --> 06:18:44.210
Orlando Sequera: right?

3771
06:18:44.910 --> 06:18:51.069
Orlando Sequera: All right. So we have come to the end of the session. This is the official end of the session.

3772
06:18:51.180 --> 06:18:52.970
Orlando Sequera: Thank you very much. Everyone.

3773
06:18:55.230 --> 06:18:56.510
Orlando Sequera: It's been a

3774
06:18:56.890 --> 06:19:00.180
Orlando Sequera: it's been a great session. We cover all the content.

3775
06:19:00.430 --> 06:19:05.980
Orlando Sequera: Please review your officially. The the session is officially over. I'm going to

3776
