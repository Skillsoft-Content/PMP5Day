Orlando Sequera: the by the right place, I mean that you selected the Pmp. Atp. That is the option for the current boot camp, and look for your Pm. Pretty much and professional 5 day cohort. That's what this type of class is it's the 5 day cohort.

22
00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:13.280
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you're in the right place, and you will be able to then go to the resources, Tab and all the resources are going to be there. Another important aspect that I want to mention. I know that some of you will like to do deeper Dives and some of the techniques and deeper dives, and some of the

23
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.429
Orlando Sequera: the actual definitions that we are covering.

24
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.559
Orlando Sequera: You can watch courses to have.

25
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.490

27
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:41.179
Orlando Sequera: okay, what we have here one research that I've been mentioning a lot. You have access to test prep under practice. Okay, you click on practice, and that's what's going to take you to test Prep. So you can take

28
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.750
Orlando Sequera: practice questions that are written by certified pmps that will help you to get ready for the exam.

29
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:58.840
Orlando Sequera: I know that he that I have. I've been doing my best to try to highlight the type of questions that you're going to be getting in your Pmp. Exam. I will continue

30
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.040
Orlando Sequera: doing that.

31
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.970
Orlando Sequera: But if you want to

32
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:12.079
Orlando Sequera: get an idea what type of questions and am I going to be getting in the Pmp. Exam. You have it already. Test, Prep. Go to test, prep, and take practice questions, and that will allow you

33
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:30.649
Orlando Sequera: to get exposed to that, and I know that the tests are like the Pmp. Exam a 100 and any questions, but you don't have to take them all. Take a few, and then, when you get ready when we cover all the content, and you feel that you're ready. Then get a baseline taking the full a 100 and any questions. But that's what's gonna get you an idea

34
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:43.360
Orlando Sequera: of the type of questions that you will be facing. Remember what I mentioned before. The exam is about critical thinking. Pmi once wants to know if you can apply this concept. If you can apply

35
00:03:43.410 --> 00:04:07.670
Orlando Sequera: this definitions in scenarios, it's about application. There is not an exam. It it. It Questions are not about definitions. That's not what they're looking for, what they're looking for is, do you know how to use? Can you apply these tools and and definitions and concepts that we're covering to. So to to the wet to solve problems that's what we do as project managers to solve problems. You're going to be facing multiple problems

36
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.909
Orlando Sequera: challenges. I want to say problems, challenges. So

37
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.700
Orlando Sequera: can you address and solve those challenges? That's what they're looking for. Okay.

38
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.659
Orlando Sequera: all right.

39
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:37.969
Orlando Sequera: If you are not a procedure, user you have to go to Github to get the resources. Okay, and this is also a fall back plan. If you are a per CPU user and precipit that some work you can always go to Github, and that's going to help you to get the resources that you need for the class.

40
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:47.879
Orlando Sequera: You click on the link for the Pmp. 5 day cohort, and that's what's gonna take you to the materials that you need for

41
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.660

88
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:26.160
Orlando Sequera: Those are the first questions that i'm going to be addressing again. We're going to have some stopping points during the session, which i'm going to spend some time going going over the questions, but i'm going to start with the ones that get the most vote. Those are the top questions.

89
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:42.249
Orlando Sequera: One thing that I want to point out one more time is that not every question is going to be answered. Unfortunately, i'm going to select the ones that are closely related to the topics that we are covering, and that will add value to the class and

90
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.270
Orlando Sequera: to your preparation for the Pmp. Exam. But, unfortunately, not every question is gonna be answered.

91
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.299
Orlando Sequera: and examples of break questions.

92
00:10:51.620 --> 00:11:02.709
Orlando Sequera: those that are related to the course content what we are covering those are great questions questions that include topics that I, everyone will benefit from learning and

93
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:09.389
Orlando Sequera: questions that are not redone. Then just let's try to pay attention and to avoid duplication. So

94
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.429
Orlando Sequera: those are examples of great questions. All right.

95
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.140
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

96
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:21.880
Orlando Sequera: It's live attendance required. And the answer again is, Yes, this is coming from the

97
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.960
Orlando Sequera: Project Management Institute, not from skills.

98
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:39.409
Orlando Sequera: but of course we have some exceptional rules. You are allowed to miss one session if you make up the session by watching the replay. But if you may, if you miss more than 50 min at any time, including breaks

99
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:47.259
Orlando Sequera: beyond the set the one session allowed, you have to make it up by attending the live session in a different 5 day cohort.

100
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.920
Orlando Sequera: if you want to. If you want to have more information about your

126
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.020
Orlando Sequera: them

127
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.310
Orlando Sequera: on day 2 we talked about

128
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:57.799
Orlando Sequera: starting the project. What happens before the project I started, and then we briefly touch upon a

129
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.549
Orlando Sequera: planning the project Lesson number 3.

130
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:10.100
Orlando Sequera: So in planning this. That's where we are right now. We're going to wrap it up. We spend our day yesterday, covering multiple areas of your

131
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:26.989
Orlando Sequera: projects that are very important, regardless of the approach. Whether you're going with a predictive approach with an adaptive approach, or agile, or with a hybrid approach. These are key areas of any project that you have to address a separately

132
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.160
Orlando Sequera: and

133
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.989
Orlando Sequera: in detail. You have to address them in detail. They need a lot of coordination. There's a lot of plan

134
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.670
Orlando Sequera: happens in all these multiple areas.

135
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.250
Orlando Sequera: So we started.

136
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:47.049
Orlando Sequera: And and this is the reason why I know that some of you were asking. But do I have to go back and change the project. Charter. No.

137
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.399
Orlando Sequera: that is a snapshot with the information that we knew at the very beginning that we need it

138
00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:09.799
Orlando Sequera: to be able to start working on the project. But this is where we're going to work on. We need to work with within our planning efforts. We need to start understanding the scope, and there's a reason why it was the first topic that we covered yesterday

139
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:16.949
Orlando Sequera: A that specific area of our project. This scope is King Scope is

140
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.800
Orlando Sequera: the foundation of any project.

141
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.580
Orlando Sequera: If you don't get this scope right.

142
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.130
Orlando Sequera: everything else is gonna

143
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:42.390
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna to crumble. Everything else is going to fall apart. Your your project is to to to, to to be to fail. Basically this is scope is really important. And within scope. We learned that the foundation of scope's so important that we have basically 2

144
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.550
Orlando Sequera: important aspects. We have the requirements for projects.

145
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.479
Orlando Sequera: We have the requirements. Okay, and the requirements are

146
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.510
Orlando Sequera: the foundation of the scope

147
00:15:54.590 --> 00:16:05.340
Orlando Sequera: of any project. We need to do a a thorough job when it comes to gathering those requirements, understanding those requirements, because that's what we have to produce

148
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:12.539
Orlando Sequera: with our project work. We need to get a solid understanding. We need to get everyone aligned.

149
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:26.349
Orlando Sequera: and by that I mean the project team and the stakeholders will need to be aligned going in the same direction, because all everything else that we're going to build with our project, and by that I mean our schedule, our budget.

150
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.300
Orlando Sequera: our race management, our resource, planning

151
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:41.699
Orlando Sequera: our quality. Everything else is going to be built around the scope of our project. That's where we start. And again, regardless of the approach. Of course we covered.

152
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.049
Orlando Sequera: What? What? How do we do it in predictive If we're following a predictive approach.

153
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.259
Orlando Sequera: we learned that there are multiple

154
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.790
Orlando Sequera: ways, shapes, or forms of requirements that's, where we have

155
00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.029
Orlando Sequera: technical requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements

156
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:07.440
Orlando Sequera: compliance requirements. We might even have project management requirements, stakeholder requirements. So it.

157
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:19.919
Orlando Sequera: if there's a pmo in place, there might be some requirements associated with the way projects are managed. So a plethora of requirements for predictive and we have to get.

158
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:29.319
Orlando Sequera: We have to be as thorough as possible when it comes to gathering those requirements. We have to use multiple

159
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:43.070
Orlando Sequera: requirement gathering techniques because the better we understand the scope the better we understand those requirements the better we're going to be able to build the scope, and they find the scope for a project, and that's going to translate to a

160
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:51.380
Orlando Sequera: it to increase the chances of being successful, so scope is the foundation of any project, and the foundation of the scope is going to be the requirements.

161
00:17:51.610 --> 00:18:00.099
Orlando Sequera: We also learned that after understanding those requirements, and having a solid understanding. Then some of those requirements are going to make it

162
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.999
Orlando Sequera: to the scope of the project. Some of them are.

163
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:11.120
Orlando Sequera: Some of them are going to make it in to this. Go, think of the scope as a boundary. But some requirements are not, and not going to be in scope.

164
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.160
Orlando Sequera: Okay, some of them are going to be out of scope.

165
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.799
Orlando Sequera: Think of the scope as a boundary, and

166
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:26.919
Orlando Sequera: in essence the scope of the project is the work that we have to do in order to produce those requirements in the form of deliverables.

167
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:37.169
Orlando Sequera: We learned about a very important document that is going to help us to track the evolution of those requirements over time, and see how requirements

168
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.169
Orlando Sequera: evolved into the Liberals, and we use the requirements, traceability, matrix for that

169
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:54.099
Orlando Sequera: I know that it sounds like a lot of work, but you have to do that. That's gonna save you from a lot of headaches because it tracks the evolution, and it also helps you to show

170
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.680
Orlando Sequera: proof to your stakeholders, to your customers that

171
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:16.429
Orlando Sequera: what was built was based on their a. On their expectations, and we keep track of that over time with the requirements traceably matrix. It's a key. It's a key document that do. You have to work that you have to prepare as the project manager, and make sure that your

172
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.530
Orlando Sequera: team members help you and assist you with that preparation.

173
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.170
Orlando Sequera: Then we also learned that in predicted projects we have.

174
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.979
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to a structure, we have an artifact that helps, that is going to help us to

175
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:36.739
Orlando Sequera: manage the scope of our project. We talked about the war breakdown structure.

176
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.880
Orlando Sequera: and

177
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:55.740
Orlando Sequera: in essence, with a word, pricing structure. What we do is we now that we have this scope defined. We know what requirements are in scope. That's what we have to build. We know where we come into our out of scope. Okay, now, what do we do? Where do we start? How do we start understanding this?

178
00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:04.419
Orlando Sequera: the scope of our of our of our project? So for that we use a work breakdown structure. Okay.

179
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:15.839
Orlando Sequera: that is basically applying the principle of dividing and conquering, dividing the scope into smaller chunk smaller areas that are going to help us to

180
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:23.139
Orlando Sequera: understand the different areas of the of the project that we need to tackle. So, for example, with building

181
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.960
Orlando Sequera: a one story house.

182
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:30.440
Orlando Sequera: we can divide this up. So okay, that's the product. We have to build a a one-story house.

183
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:37.189
Orlando Sequera: Let's divide the scope we have multiple errors. We might have this structure. We might have the foundation

184
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:54.010
Orlando Sequera: interior structure, exterior structure, and then the roof. Let's assume that it's an and then less landscaping 5 areas 8. So that's how we start breaking down the scope. This couple of then we can divide those areas into smaller chunks as well. So we start

185
00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:08.050
Orlando Sequera: with the structure, for example, exterior structure, and then we have internal walls and external walls. Let's assume that that's that's another division subdivision that we're doing of the scope and then within

186
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.420
Orlando Sequera: that division. Let's break it down a little bit more to a lower level, and that's what's gonna Take us to a

187
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.320
Orlando Sequera: in this specific example.

188
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.530
Orlando Sequera: We have windows

189
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:27.039
Orlando Sequera: in the exterior walls and windows in the interior walls, for example, and that window is gonna be

190
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.140
Orlando Sequera: the lowest level for this particular example. That's what we call the board package.

191
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:43.130
Orlando Sequera: Always remember that we're packages. We use nouns for them we can have for the exterior walls. For example, we have. We can have windows, and we can have doors.

192
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:50.809
Orlando Sequera: Okay, those are examples of board packages. And what do we have under those 4 packages? We have actions that

193
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.539
Orlando Sequera: we have actions that we have to complete in order to deliver those 4 packages.

194
00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:02.279
Orlando Sequera: Those actions are what we call project activities, and they, we use verbs to

195
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:10.380
Orlando Sequera: to denote those actions. For example, for windows we have to measure the window; we have to

196
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.839
Orlando Sequera: purchase the window or fabricate the window. So those are

197
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.039
Orlando Sequera: verbs. Those are actions install measure.

198
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:26.619
Orlando Sequera: We have to test the window. That's how we deliver the window. Okay, so that's how we can come up with the list of

199
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:33.969
Orlando Sequera: activities that we have to complete in our project. Remember, this is for predictive. I'm referring to predictive

200
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:35.580
Orlando Sequera: A,

201
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.729
Orlando Sequera: and that at that level of primarily, if you roll that up, that's how

202
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:49.720
Orlando Sequera: you can get us a thorough understanding of the scope of the work that you have to complete for your project. That's how you can come up

203
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.699
Orlando Sequera: with a list of activities that are going to help you

204
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.290
Orlando Sequera: with a list of activities that you have to complete

205
00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.519
Orlando Sequera: for your project. Okay, that's the beauty of the word breakdown structure.

206
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.929
Orlando Sequera: That's predictive, then, for agile, for adaptive

207
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:11.639
Orlando Sequera: is a little bit different. This code in predictive is fixed. We have to define the scope.

208
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.779
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to create something that is called.

209
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.620
Orlando Sequera: They

210
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:24.380
Orlando Sequera: scope baseline. Okay for a project. And there are 3 elements. By the way, this this there's a description of the scope we call that scope statement.

211
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:31.320
Orlando Sequera: The second element is the actual work breakdown structure that I just mentioned. The third element is

212
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:40.419
Orlando Sequera: a dictionary that comes with that Wbs: because the Wbs by itself. You can put all that information if you show that to someone that is not

213
00:23:40.660 --> 00:24:01.569
Orlando Sequera: even to a project team member. I have seen it happening. We need the corresponding key document that can explain to you. Okay, what is 1 point, 1 point, one. What do you mean by that? I I don't really understand, so that a that key document is going to be the Wbs dictionary. Those 3 elements are what we call

214
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.290
Orlando Sequera: this combine. They form the scope baseline. This is only going to be changing

215
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:21.740
Orlando Sequera: through change control process. Okay. But in agile the scope is not fixed, the scope is changing, and that's why we decided to go and use that approach. Okay, in situations that's going to be the best approach. So.

216
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:22.780
Orlando Sequera: for

217
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.269
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to requirements

218
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:32.279
Orlando Sequera: we look at requirements in a different way. We write a short description of the function

219
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:41.100
Orlando Sequera: from one perspective, which is the customer's perspective. That's how we write requirements in agile and

220
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.260
Orlando Sequera: the equivalent of the word breakdown structure in predictive

221
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.250
Orlando Sequera: in agile. It's going to be what we call the

222
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:56.269
Orlando Sequera: product backlog, which is a running to do list. It's a to-do list and what did you have in the to do list user stories.

223
00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:14.979
Orlando Sequera: there were some questions yesterday, but what about technical a requirements in a major project? There are going to be technical requirements. How are those addressed? Well, that is, up to the team. The team is formed by experts. They are the ones that are going to break down those

224
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.480
Orlando Sequera: user stories into tasks.

225
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.600
Orlando Sequera: and they are the ones that are gonna manage as a self-organized and self-manage unit.

226
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:39.770
Orlando Sequera: All Those technical aspects are in and not just technical. There might be some other aspects involved with the work that they have to do. That's off to the team as a self-organizing, self self-managed unit in

227
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:48.290
Orlando Sequera: in in it. Oh, if we're following an agile approach, so we'd write requirements, using user stories. They only need to know the what.

228
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:56.209
Orlando Sequera: how we get there that's up to the team. So it's a little bit different from predictive. So keep that in mind that's how we manage requirements.

229
00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:16.070
Orlando Sequera: That's how we manage the scope. And as your projects using the per backlog, and that to do list is going to be changing, some of those user stories are gonna drop from the list. So some some new user stories are going to be added. So it's always a changing a changing to do list. That's what the actual prot backlook is.

230
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.150
Orlando Sequera: Then we moved on. Once we have

231
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.830
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna i'm gonna go back to predictive.

232
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:35.690
Orlando Sequera: Or once we have that list of activities that we created with our war breakdown structure. We have to start putting that together. Okay, Some things need to happen first. Some things need to happen later.

233
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:43.919
Orlando Sequera: So so you don't You don't want to be like me. You don't want to start building the house, starting with a roof. Let's put the roof together, and then we'll build everything else

234
00:26:43.930 --> 00:27:03.560
Orlando Sequera: when you don't know anything about construction. So no, you want to make the best use of your resources. You want to be as efficient as possible. So there's gonna be a logical sequence that we can follow in order to a work with our a with our list of activities. So that's where we talked about dependencies that were.

235
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.499
Orlando Sequera: we started building our network diagrams. Some activities can start

236
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:24.379
Orlando Sequera: need to happen first with the house. Probably you start with a foundation right working with it from building the foundation of the house, and then you build the structure, and eventually you get to the roof. Of course there's way much more than that that needs to happen. But

237
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:32.349
Orlando Sequera: we need to understand that logical sequence working with your team members with the team members that are the subject matter experts. They can

238
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:43.899
Orlando Sequera: guide you through that process. But you start connecting those activities, E: following a logical sequence, and you build your network diagram, and then you have to identify something that

239
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:55.359
Orlando Sequera: is really important. We start, we have to identify. We have to estimate the duration of those activities. How long is it going to take? That's part of the schedule? And we also have to

240
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.209
Orlando Sequera: a Well, that's an estimation process.

241
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.090
Orlando Sequera: We said that that's done through

242
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:13.790
Orlando Sequera: it's an approximation that that duration should be ideally done by the people doing the work, even in predictive in agile, is non-negotiable in agile

243
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:26.520
Orlando Sequera: people are doing the work. They are the ones doing the estimation. And we start putting together those network diagrams connecting all of our activities, and we have to be able to determine the critical path

244
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:39.690
Orlando Sequera: we're going to. The connection is gonna happen connecting them with arrows. And we we're gonna have multiple paths in our network diagram. But we have to be able to identify the critical path which is the longest path.

245
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:56.719
Orlando Sequera: and it's gonna tell us the shortest amount of time that is going to take us to complete our project. That's the beauty of the critical path. So when you get asked by your stakeholders so great, how long is it going to take to to complete this project? Well.

246
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.839
Orlando Sequera: Mr. Mrs. Stakeholder, it's going to take 12 weeks. It's going to take 13 weeks. It's going to take 6 months, etc., right?

247
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.610
Orlando Sequera: So

248
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:14.429
Orlando Sequera: by doing that you have been able to identify also those activities that cannot be delayed. Any activity that is part of the trick or path

249
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.400
Orlando Sequera: cannot be delayed, because if they are delayed.

250
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:29.560
Orlando Sequera: then your entire project is going to be delayed. So you have to safeguard. You have to protect those activities from being delayed. Those are that part of your job as a project manager. Okay.

251
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.060
Orlando Sequera: Then we also talked about the importance of

252
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:49.160
Orlando Sequera: at resources. We're gonna have resources assigned to those activities to be completed. But we need to understand resource, availability that is done through negotiation and remember that we have competing priorities. We have competing

253
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:59.349
Orlando Sequera: projects. We have operations, and at least the same pool of resources. So you have to go through negotiations. You have to know when those resources are available, and by resources I mean

254
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.030
Orlando Sequera: not only

255
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.870
Orlando Sequera: human resources, but also

256
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:23.199
Orlando Sequera: equipment materials and supplies. Okay, so you got to take that into account when those reasons are available. So when you're doing your planning, gotta make sure that you look at resource calendars to understand when those resources are available and go through negotiation because you don't want to put information you don't want to assign. For example, we need a 3D printer

257
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:40.719
Orlando Sequera: to produce a some, a 3D models of what we're doing in what we need to do in a project when that 3D printer is being used by a different projecting, for example, or you don't want to schedule an activity to be completed by Re. By John Smith.

258
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:47.300
Orlando Sequera: A. A. Dba, for example, a database architect, Gwen John Smith, is out on vacation.

259
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:56.129
Orlando Sequera: It to do. You need to coordinate, or when he's working on 2 other projects? So that's that's part of the planning effort that we have to do with our

260
00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:07.600
Orlando Sequera: resources. One thing that I that I didn't mention. I was scheduled that we covered yesterday. Can you optimize your schedule? The answer is, yes, you can do it from 2 perspective.

261
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.740
Orlando Sequera: The first one is from the resource perspective you can use.

262
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:25.129
Orlando Sequera: and you can use resource moving to make sure that you're making the best use of your resources that you're not over working people. Yes, this is going to take 6 months to complete. But as long as we work

263
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.539
Orlando Sequera: 80 h a week, for example.

264
00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:51.560
Orlando Sequera: that's not what you have to level that and then smoothing, making sure that you're making that that in some weeks you're not over working people in similar weeks you were only working 10 h, so that is also really important for you to take into account. Use those techniques so you can improve and optimize your schedule as well.

265
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.600
Orlando Sequera: Using compression techniques.

266
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.010
Orlando Sequera: You can

267
00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:06.870
Orlando Sequera: and use fast tracking, for example, that's one way. And it's basically doing things activities that you normally will do in in a following a sequence.

268
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.670
Orlando Sequera: You do them in parallel. That's one way of doing it. A examples of that

269
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:19.869
Orlando Sequera: f one nascar. They do it all the time when in at the pit stop. There's a lot of things that are happening

270
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:37.550
Orlando Sequera: at the same time, so it is possible to do it. And not only mask, or if I want F one. It happens in some products it's possible to do it some activities, and the goal is to short, If you're asked to shorten the schedule to compress the schedule. That's one way. But there are some drawbacks with that that can have an impact in quality.

271
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:55.469
Orlando Sequera: Other than those people that work at at f one, and and the nascar, for example, I wouldn't. I wouldn't get a bunch of Irish people to be working at a pit. Stop! That will be a disaster. I wouldn't even try that, myself. There's a lot of training, because otherwise quality came.

272
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:10.500
Orlando Sequera: It's going to suffer. You're gonna have a lot of rework, a lot of defects. It can. It can be a disaster, right? So in most cases, that's a true statement. But we have to evaluate on a case by case some cases that's gonna work. But

273
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:19.890
Orlando Sequera: it is an option that we have. Is it going to work every single in every single situation. The answer is, No; but it is an option. The second option that we have to make it better is what we call

274
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:27.509
Orlando Sequera: a crashing, which is having a users to adding more

275
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.879
Orlando Sequera: people to those activities that are part of the critical path. To shorten the duration.

276
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.529
Orlando Sequera: It's not always a silver bullet, either. It's not always an answer. It has it. It's gonna have an impact on your

277
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:55.890
Orlando Sequera: A on your project. It's going to increase the budget. You're going to have to pay over time or spend more on hiring more people. So it's going to have an impact on your project and you have to take multiple variables. It works for some activities.

278
00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:09.529
Orlando Sequera: but it's not a silver bullet, either, contrary to popular belief that some people in upper management tend to think. Okay, so we talked about that and resources, and we ended up talking about the budget of our project, and

279
00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:20.609
Orlando Sequera: we need to understand the cost. We have to estimate the cost of those activities. When we put them together, we need to understand how much is going to cost, and we have to aggregate those costs.

280
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.580
Orlando Sequera: Then we also need to take into account.

281
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:29.959
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to budget after we aggregate the cost, the individual costs of activities

282
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.010
Orlando Sequera: we have to take into account also

283
00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.159
Orlando Sequera: A.

284
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.289
Orlando Sequera: We need to have some buffers. We need to have some preserves

285
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:47.179
Orlando Sequera: to address any risks that could materialize in our project, and we call that a contingency reserve. So if you add your

286
00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:53.109
Orlando Sequera: cost, you you aggregated cost, plus your continuous to reserve, then you have

287
00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.730
Orlando Sequera: your cost based length. That's what your cost based on is going to be.

288
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.780
Orlando Sequera: But if you really want to know your overall project.

289
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:08.680
Orlando Sequera: you have to add another type of reserve that we call management reserve. Those reserves are used to address

290
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:21.349
Orlando Sequera: risks that were not identified for our project. And today we're going to talk about risks, and this is going to make a little bit more sense. What do you mean by identified race? We should be able to identify every single risk for a project.

291
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:29.989
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna talk about that. We should do a thorough job when it comes to risk notification, but is simply not possible. And we're going to go over that.

292
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.160
Orlando Sequera: and we need to be ready even for the unknown. Okay.

293
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.230
Orlando Sequera: And if you add the management reserve, plus your

294
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.629
Orlando Sequera: cost baseline. That's how you can have your overall

295
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:51.859
Orlando Sequera: project budget, also known as budget like completion, as we're going to find in when we cover and value management.

296
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.110
Orlando Sequera: and that sets the tone. And we also talked about procurement

297
00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:01.940
Orlando Sequera: and contracts, a different kind of contract that we have for both.

298
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.730
Orlando Sequera: A. If we're following a predictive approach.

299
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.209
Orlando Sequera: we talked about the contracts costs reimburseable. We talked about fixed price and the different flavors.

300
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:28.219
Orlando Sequera: 3 in custom, first of all 3 different flavors in a fixed price, and then the hybrid, which is time and materials, and we also talked about, Mention a at least briefly the different contracts that you have. If you're following an agile approach.

301
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:48.090
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect about procurement is that remember that you're going to be working with other departments when it comes to procurement you're working with your procurement department, and you're also working with the legal department. They're the ones that are drafting the contract, not you. So you're working with all their people body with your projects, so you have to work with them

302
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:52.259
Orlando Sequera: in following the processes and following the guidelines

303
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:59.020
Orlando Sequera: in a nutshell. That's what we covered yesterday and today we're going to continue our journey.

304
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.879
Orlando Sequera: It

305
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.549
Orlando Sequera: cover in other areas. We're going to start with risks.

306
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.899
Orlando Sequera: Then we're going to move on to quality of our project.

307
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.790
Orlando Sequera: Then

308
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:27.149
Orlando Sequera: another important area, which is everything comes together. We keep saying the project management plan this subsidiary plans, and for every a area that we have mentioned, we have said that we gotta have a plan and scope is so important that we have 2 plans. We have requirements, management plan as Co. Management plan

309
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:45.240
Orlando Sequera: that should give you an an indication on how important scope is that we have 2 plans to minute scope. So we have one for schedule, one for procurement, one for resources, one for budget. But they all got to come together, and that area is what we call integration. That's how we can develop our

310
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:51.799
Orlando Sequera: overall project management plan, which is a compilation of those subsidiary plans.

311
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Orlando Sequera: Then we're going to move on to

312
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.330
Orlando Sequera: another

313
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.190
Orlando Sequera: another lesson that's on Number 4, and we're going to start

314
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:05.120
Orlando Sequera: focusing on the team. That is important for the exam. We're gonna we're gonna talk about leadership.

315
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:20.919
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna talk about creating a collaborative project team environment super important. It's gonna be more on the a human resource aspect and working with the team leadership. We're going to shift gears from process to working with the team

316
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.440
Orlando Sequera: how to empower the team supporting team member performance.

317
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:43.900
Orlando Sequera: how to communicate and collaborate with stakeholders, which we mentioned briefly on day one. But we're going to continue reinforcing that message of this important. Then we're going to talk about developing those resources, training, coaching, and mentoring in one topic that is super important. We're going to wrap up

318
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:55.549
Orlando Sequera: our session today with conflict management super important for the exam. That's something. But remember everything. If it's here, it is important. For the example, i'm going to try to highlight

319
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.450
Orlando Sequera: a those topics that are

320
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.799
Orlando Sequera: definitely super testable that chances are that you're gonna find in your Pmp extent.

321
00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:08.240
Orlando Sequera: So, without any further due. We're gonna get started.

322
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.359
Orlando Sequera: and before

323
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:16.400
Orlando Sequera: before we get started I would like to review

324
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.319
Orlando Sequera: the Q. And a.

325
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.819
Orlando Sequera: For any content related questions.

326
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:35.160
Orlando Sequera: There is one question at the top in a situation where the effort initially estimated in the Wbs is not reflecting the complexity of the scope.

327
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:42.339
Orlando Sequera: Once the project has started. How did you adjust great question? Great question that happens. That happens.

328
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:48.349
Orlando Sequera: Remember that we're creating the Wbs with what we know. But more information can

329
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.060
Orlando Sequera: come up. So the answer to that question is

330
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.629
Orlando Sequera: we

331
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.979
Orlando Sequera: we'll have to create a change request

332
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:15.449
Orlando Sequera: to incorporate aspects of the scope that we're not taking into account. So the answer, the short answer is, You can do that. You can solve that situation through a change control process. So a change request has to be created. We missed this portions of the scope. We missed this in the scope.

333
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.439
Orlando Sequera: This has to be added, then that's going to get routed to the

334
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:23.449
Orlando Sequera: but that is going to evaluate the impact of that change.

335
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:45.980
Orlando Sequera: It could be add in scope, or it could be removing scope, and they're going to make a determination based on the impact and the impact to what they impact to the schedule, the impact to the budget, the impact to the scope, and they're going to make a determination. Okay, that's how you address that situation following the change control process. That's a change that will be a change. And it happens all the time.

336
00:40:48.130 --> 00:41:07.149
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the Q. A crashing increase cost usually. Yes, because crashing means adding more people to work on an activity. So there is a there's going to be a cost associated with that, even if it's a using over time. So yes, usually it increases the cost.

337
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.549
Orlando Sequera: So the answer is, yes.

338
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:26.570
Orlando Sequera: Well, there's another question. When we discuss in the Budget estimation yesterday, on slide 1 15, there were 3 methods of estimating. One was analogous

339
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.000
Orlando Sequera: which will produce that rough

340
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:38.339
Orlando Sequera: magnitude. There were 2 others. Do you have parametric, and you have bottom up estimated which is the most accurate one. With make sure

341
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.639
Orlando Sequera: review that.

342
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.380
Orlando Sequera: And yesterday's session

343
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:49.820
Orlando Sequera: who defines the scope. It's a collaborative. It's a

344
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:57.010
Orlando Sequera: it's a. It's the product of working the project team members working with the stakeholders and getting to an agreement.

345
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.650
Orlando Sequera: So it's a

346
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.219
Orlando Sequera: it's a collaborative effort to define the scope. But you gotta get sign off from

347
00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:12.910
Orlando Sequera: a people, but it's not just the project manager you're gonna get. They buy in from the stakeholders. Remember that you're building that for the stakeholders. So they have to agree

348
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.040
Orlando Sequera: A:

349
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.870
Orlando Sequera: they have to be on the same page.

350
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.339
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

351
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:39.760
Orlando Sequera: Another question. Technical requirements can be documented as a user story or a task in a user story. Okay, not what is documented in the user stories. The description of the functionality told from the perspective

352
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:45.050
Orlando Sequera: customer technical requirements. So the team is gonna work on that, and they're the ones that

353
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.540
Orlando Sequera: the user story into tasks.

354
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:53.759
Orlando Sequera: Okay, the only one to need to know they have they? What what is it that you're looking for.

355
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.189
Orlando Sequera: Mr. Customer. That's what they need to know.

356
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.920
Orlando Sequera: All right.

357
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.759
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna get started.

358
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:16.000
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna continue with the classes. We with the class. All right. So let's get started. We have a lot to cover.

359
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.519
Orlando Sequera: and we'll come back to questions a little bit later.

360
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.590
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to start with a very important topic. I would like to

361
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:27.569
Orlando Sequera: a half your

362
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.460
Orlando Sequera: attention. This is an important topic for the exam risks.

363
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.880
Orlando Sequera: This is gonna cover

364
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.160
Orlando Sequera: things that can go wrong in a project. Okay.

365
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.240
Orlando Sequera: and uncertainties.

366
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.189
Orlando Sequera: So

367
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.350
Orlando Sequera: a risk is.

368
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:53.459
Orlando Sequera: and not only things that can go wrong, you know it's also things that that can go well. So that's a common misconception. Most people tend to associate, risk

369
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.540
Orlando Sequera: a with a negative

370
00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:01.899
Orlando Sequera: aspect, or give risk, and never a negative connotation. But risk

371
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.609
Orlando Sequera: can be positive as well.

372
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.109
Orlando Sequera: So we can have negative risks.

373
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.240
Orlando Sequera: And, by the way, we called those threats.

374
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:15.749
Orlando Sequera: but we can also have positive risks, and we call those opportunities

375
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.839
Orlando Sequera: emissions.

376
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.720
Orlando Sequera: A risk is a type of uncertainty.

377
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:33.610
Orlando Sequera: Pay attention. A risk is a type of uncertainty, something that may or may not happen in our project may or may not happen in our project.

378
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.570
Orlando Sequera: You might be wondering, oh.

379
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:40.479
Orlando Sequera: what about issues are issues the same as risks? The answer is, No.

380
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:44.190
Orlando Sequera: an issue is a negative risk

381
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.359
Orlando Sequera: that came to fruition.

382
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.349
Orlando Sequera: Okay, this no longer an uncertainty, An issue is at risk

383
00:44:51.690 --> 00:45:00.970
Orlando Sequera: that materialized a risk that happened. We have to address it. It's no longer an uncertain may or may not happen. That's a risk.

384
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.970
Orlando Sequera: If it happened, it becomes an issue, and you have to act.

385
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:06.049
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

386
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:06.910
Orlando Sequera: So

387
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:14.120
Orlando Sequera: risk can come in any way, shape or form. Risk can come out of nowhere in

388
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:31.640
Orlando Sequera: from any of of the of the area. The project areas any from anywhere. Basically so that's why, when we get to risk notification, we're going to see that that that's also a team sport. It's not just up to the product manager. It's not up just up to the project team.

389
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:45.859
Orlando Sequera: Everyone is going to be in charge of risk identification tasks. Why is that because risk can come in any way, shape or form, and usually one aspect that is important that is shown here to understand is that

390
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.919
Orlando Sequera: risks

391
00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:58.230
Orlando Sequera: are the result of a trigger condition. I'm. Going to give you an example that is widely popular for those of you here in the Us. And those of you that are not in the Us. Can relate to this.

392
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.379
Orlando Sequera: because it happens every single year

393
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.120
Orlando Sequera: hurricanes.

394
00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.830
Orlando Sequera: hurricane season for those of you that are

395
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.510
Orlando Sequera: that have been in the Florida area hurricane season every year is

396
00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.490
Orlando Sequera: we got to pay attention to what happens in the Atlantic Ocean

397
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.600
Orlando Sequera: in

398
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:25.490
Orlando Sequera: many people tend to tend to say that. Oh, there's a risk of hurricane in hurricanes in Florida that's not really the risk

399
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.970
Orlando Sequera: Let's Assume that we're working on a construction project

400
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.050
Orlando Sequera: and we're building a one-story house in South Florida, for example.

401
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.859
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

402
00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.439
Orlando Sequera: And the trigger condition for the risk

403
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:45.269
Orlando Sequera: there. Are minute risks associated with the weather. Right? That will be a one category of risks that we will have to evaluate.

404
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.820
Orlando Sequera: But the hurricane itself is not the risk. The hurricane is the trigger condition.

405
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:57.430
Orlando Sequera: If we are working on identified risks for a project. The risks are risk of structural damage

406
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:08.869
Orlando Sequera: due to high speed wings associated with hurricane or the risk of flooding. Those are 2 examples of risks associated with a trigger condition. In this case

407
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.710
Orlando Sequera: the hurricane. Okay. So we have to

408
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:16.200
Orlando Sequera: pay attention to that. Understand what are the trigger conditions. And then

409
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:21.819
Orlando Sequera: what are the actual risks associated with that? A trigger condition

410
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:28.260
Orlando Sequera: going back to our example of the life center for

411
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.450
Orlando Sequera: shop industries.

412
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.929
Orlando Sequera: The project risks that we were able to identify with

413
00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:41.720
Orlando Sequera: project, manager and fame that we see here in this slide, working with new vendors and building processes

414
00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.999
Orlando Sequera: supply chain issues for correct bricks. And that's

415
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:51.070
Orlando Sequera: That's reality. Right now, with the global supply chain issues that we're experiencing

416
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.989
Orlando Sequera: building, code compliance, risk associated with that

417
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.129
Orlando Sequera: key stakeholder conflict.

418
00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:05.049
Orlando Sequera: retail market changes decline of in store shopping. That's that's a risk also because of

419
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:11.949
Orlando Sequera: online retail, right in site survey shows risk of slippage from coastal erosion to

420
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:20.099
Orlando Sequera: in less than 25 years. So those are the risks that we were able to identify for our shop industries lifestyle center.

421
00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.189
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that

422
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.440
Orlando Sequera: in that list of

423
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.089
Orlando Sequera: project risk that has a name.

424
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:41.160
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna go over that in more detail. That's what we call this is a simple version of what we call at stake at a risk register, which is a list of risks that we have been able to identify for our projects.

425
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.009
Orlando Sequera: Then

426
00:48:48.940 --> 00:49:04.889
Orlando Sequera: 1 one aspect that that we have to to take into account. What are the 2 aspects that we that we evaluate when it comes to risks? Most most organizations are going to to take this this same approach. That's what they look at.

427
00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:09.530
Orlando Sequera: The 2 aspects that we evaluate when it comes to risks, are

428
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.440
Orlando Sequera: the likelihood or probability of occurrence.

429
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:13.450
Orlando Sequera: That's

430
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:14.890
Orlando Sequera: for starters.

431
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.229
Orlando Sequera: What is the likelihood of this risk coming to fruition.

432
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:22.390
Orlando Sequera: And then the impact of that risk

433
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:29.560
Orlando Sequera: in our project. So those are the 2 aspects that we, the criteria that we use to evaluate risks

434
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.859
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

435
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.479
Orlando Sequera: a mostly

436
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:41.260
Orlando Sequera: the approach, is going to change within the lifecycle context. Whether we're going predictive or

437
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:46.370
Orlando Sequera: in in predictive approaches, risk is going to be managed and minimized

438
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.250
Orlando Sequera: when we talk about

439
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:54.469
Orlando Sequera: the risk responses that we have available. We're going to see that risk. Elimination is simply not possible.

440
00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:09.230
Orlando Sequera: It is impossible to eliminate risk. That's not an option. We're always gonna have risks in our project, but we have to. We have to do as much as possible, to have to identify as many as possible and to have responses

441
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:17.710
Orlando Sequera: in place for those risks that we were able to identify. But eliminated risk is simply not possible. We can mitigate risk.

442
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:24.600
Orlando Sequera: We can reduce the probability and impact. But we cannot eliminate a risk. 100%.

443
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.059
Orlando Sequera: Okay, something to keep in mind

444
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:28.529
Orlando Sequera: A.

445
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:30.779
Orlando Sequera: When

446
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.679
Orlando Sequera: you might be wondering. So how do we do it in if we're following an adaptive approach.

447
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:52.000
Orlando Sequera: If we're following an agile approach, the nature of that type of life cycle working with shorter timeframes like 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks per iteration. That gives you an a a Really.

448
00:50:52.390 --> 00:51:00.399
Orlando Sequera: It's a a really good way, or really efficient way to mitigate risks that are

449
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:15.640
Orlando Sequera: that could be present in your project as early as possible. Okay, so that's one advantage that you have with. Add your projects. You want to address uncertainty as early as possible in your project, and the fact that you're working in shorter timeframes

450
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.659
Orlando Sequera: that is conducive to that. If we're following a predictive approach.

451
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.049
Orlando Sequera: You need to know more information.

452
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:39.239
Orlando Sequera: Ask you work in your project. So then, the level of uncertainty is going to start decreasing, as more information becomes available. So it's a little bit different. Not not so much at the beginning like we like we can do with an agile approach.

453
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.140
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

454
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.729
Orlando Sequera: a one aspect that is also important. Is that

455
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:55.050
Orlando Sequera: going back to the organizational culture and understanding your organization, you and and also the industry you need to know

456
00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:04.470
Orlando Sequera: what type of a what is the risk strategy for the organization? Okay? And that goes along with the industry.

457
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:11.910
Orlando Sequera: For example, I can tell you from firsthand experience that NASA is risk adverse.

458
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:16.590
Orlando Sequera: NASA is risk of first anything, because human lives are at stake.

459
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:21.859
Orlando Sequera: So they are. The the risk. Appetite is low. They risk averse.

460
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.669
Orlando Sequera: But there are some other organizations in other industry.

461
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.269
Orlando Sequera: It's seeking when or miss issues are

462
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.249
Orlando Sequera: okay for profit, they are the risk. Appetite is higher.

463
00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:37.700
Orlando Sequera: and you also need to know what is the risk threshold

464
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.849
Orlando Sequera: that the organization has

465
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:48.540
Orlando Sequera: in place. That is important for you to know. That's why, going back to what I mentioned before. It is so important for you

466
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:56.120
Orlando Sequera: to understand the organizational culture, because this is one aspect of that, and it's going to drive the way

467
00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:14.830
Orlando Sequera: it it's gonna drive the way you have to manage risk and your project so the better. You understand that the chances are you're going to be more successful. So you need to understand that it takes time. That's why you need to rely on the Pmo. But you need to understand that. Have that situation and awareness that I call

468
00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.640
Okay.

469
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.330
Orlando Sequera: And

470
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.460
Orlando Sequera: it is important, too.

471
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.300
Orlando Sequera: Define that. Your initial risk strategy. Take into account

472
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.319
Orlando Sequera: the complexity, the importance, the development approach that you're following

473
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.220
Orlando Sequera: A, and in your risk

474
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:48.130
Orlando Sequera: and your risk plan, you have to take into account that strategy what method you're going to follow? Who's going to be responsible for addressing those risk. You gotta take that into account. You need 2 things to address risk.

475
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.589
Orlando Sequera: You need money, and you need time. That's where the reserves come into play.

476
00:53:53.840 --> 00:54:10.840
Orlando Sequera: The contingency reserves for those risks that we were able to identify, and also the management reserves for those risks that we were not able to identify. But nonetheless, you need time and money. You have to categorize those risks, group the ones that are

477
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:15.120
Orlando Sequera: a similar in nature together, so you can have a very visual and

478
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:22.489
Orlando Sequera: increase the chance of success when addressing those risks need to understand your stakeholder risk appetite.

479
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.220
Orlando Sequera: You have to define

480
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:34.529
Orlando Sequera: the risk, probability, or likelihood of occurrence and impact for the organization. We're going to go over some examples that can help us to do that. And

481
00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:41.470
Orlando Sequera: the key, a artifact or or template, or document that is going to help us to define

482
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.260
Orlando Sequera: and classify a risk when it comes to

483
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.269
Orlando Sequera: probability and impact is what we call a probability and impact matrix.

484
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.319
Orlando Sequera: We also need to know how to report

485
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:59.750
Orlando Sequera: risks to our stakeholders. What are the formats that we need to use again if we have a Pmo in place that's going to be done using

486
00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.560
Orlando Sequera: a the templates that are provided by the Pmo. But we still need to know

487
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.889
Orlando Sequera: how to do that. That is very important, because your

488
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.129
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders

489
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:19.480
Orlando Sequera: in your organization, any organization regardless of the industry they might not know anything about project management, but they are going to ask you

490
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.859
Orlando Sequera: 3 key questions.

491
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.370
Orlando Sequera: They're going to ask you.

492
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.139
Orlando Sequera: It's my project on time about the schedule.

493
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:29.719
Orlando Sequera: Is it ahead of schedule, or is it behind schedule? They know that

494
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.719
Orlando Sequera: they are going to ask you.

495
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.369
Orlando Sequera: It's my project on budget

496
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:38.849
Orlando Sequera: or over budget. They're gonna ask you that. And in those project status meetings

497
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.979
Orlando Sequera: that's what you can. Those are the questions that you're going to answer.

498
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:52.619
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's why we're using all these tools to provide that information to them and to manage our projects. This is how we can manage our projects, and the third one is about risks.

499
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:56.640
Orlando Sequera: Are, are you? I see that

500
00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:09.649
Orlando Sequera: there are new risk. A couple of risks came to fruition. There is a hurricane coming, and that's going to Trigger possible floating in that area. What are you doing to to address the the risk of floating

501
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:27.199
Orlando Sequera: or structural damage? What what is being done? Those are the questions that you're going to get. That's why this is so important. And then we need to be able to track this this documents we because they're going to be evolving that list of risks. The risk register is a living document. It means that it's going to be changing.

502
00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:30.489
Orlando Sequera: Why is that? Because new risks are going to be coming up.

503
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:35.200
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be identified. Some risks are going to be addressed, and they need to be

504
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:43.210
Orlando Sequera: a documented as such. So that is, it's crucial that you keep your bricks register updated at all times

505
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:50.210
Orlando Sequera: when it comes going back to Agile

506
00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:56.330
Orlando Sequera: when he come when he goes back to go going back to agile for and and risk management

507
00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:16.769
Orlando Sequera: teams what they tend to do. And we see here our stacy model. We talked about it before, and we're taking with the Stacy model. We can use it to understand the uncertainty of requirements. And then the technology that we have available that can help us to place some of the

508
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:36.909
Orlando Sequera: we can. We can use this tool to place some of the use of stories and understand the risk associated with them. The team can understand whether we don't have the technology. And this this this is way. This is way too far from from what we can deliver is so. It's far from agreement.

509
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.680
Orlando Sequera: and

510
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.999
Orlando Sequera: is far from certainty if it's something that is

511
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:47.249
Orlando Sequera: in the category of chaotic, then a

512
00:57:47.440 --> 00:58:02.190
Orlando Sequera: though that's something that needs to be addressed. The team has to go over planning and talk to the stakeholders and try to get everyone. Everyone's attention and try to address that as quickly as possible. So they.

513
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.729
Orlando Sequera: The bottom line here is that

514
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:19.209
Orlando Sequera: in agile we try to address risk as early on in the project. They make it part of their work. So it's not always developing new functionality. They work that it's been done in an iteration or spring

515
00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:35.770
Orlando Sequera: teams. Try to address risk as much as possible, and they make it part of their work. It's part of the backlog work, so it's not just a developing new functionality. They go over this in their planning meetings, and they do use a risk register like we do in predictive.

516
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:46.769
Orlando Sequera: and they keep this information visible to everyone. Probably this is one difference between predictive and agile in the way that we communicate the state of

517
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.350
Orlando Sequera: current risks

518
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:50.930
Orlando Sequera: in predictive. We usually do that

519
00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:55.120
Orlando Sequera: we have project status meetings, and that's one topic

520
00:58:55.140 --> 00:59:00.509
Orlando Sequera: that is a cover during the product Times meeting with the stakeholders

521
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:06.180
Orlando Sequera: born in adaptive in agile. We don't have time for that we need to use other

522
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:16.380
Orlando Sequera: a other means other ways to provide that information in real time, and for that we use something that is an in something that we call information radiator.

523
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:24.129
Orlando Sequera: That is an artifact that allows us to. It's a graphic representation of the work that it's been done

524
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:28.719
Orlando Sequera: that has multiple columns, and one of those columns is going to be

525
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:32.020
Orlando Sequera: to risks in what's being done. So anyone

526
00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:49.429
Orlando Sequera: the Camden Board, for example, that's an example of a information radiator, and you can. There are multiple tools out there like Jira, for example, you can create an information radiator, a Camden board, a dashboard that shows the status of the work and risk is one

527
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:56.940
Orlando Sequera: aspect of that. So anyone that would like to understand what's going on. They don't need to wait for for a styles report. They can look at it in real time.

528
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.859
Orlando Sequera: Okay, but we do address it in in

529
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.640
Orlando Sequera: in agile and predictive. It's super super super important.

530
01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.509
Orlando Sequera: all right.

531
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:21.310
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to risk notification. So I mentioned before, this is a team sport. When it comes to risk identification for your project. It's not just you as the product manager. Of course you have to

532
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:22.580
Orlando Sequera: work on that.

533
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:29.909
Orlando Sequera: It's not just the team members. Of course they have to assist you. With that They're the subject matter experts. They can help you to identify race.

534
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.139
Orlando Sequera: You have to involve the stakeholders

535
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.409
Orlando Sequera: as well. They can help you to identify risk, and

536
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:43.420
Orlando Sequera: but at the Pm. You have to provide that awareness to your team members, to your stakeholders

537
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.940
Orlando Sequera: that it is important that if you see something, say something.

538
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.080
Orlando Sequera: speak up.

539
01:00:49.130 --> 01:01:08.020
Orlando Sequera: help us to identify risks because they can come in any way, shape or form, and the more thorough we are, risk identification, the better is going to be for your project. So we have to provide that awareness, and not even just the stakeholders. Anyone within the organization, for that matter should be involved

540
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:19.370
Orlando Sequera: in risk identification. So see something, say something that is important. But the same way that we did with gathering requirements we should use multiple tools.

541
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:29.749
Orlando Sequera: One is brainstorming. Get everyone in the conference room or in a call in the zoom call and start working on a identifying brace. That's great. But you can. You also use

542
01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.460
Orlando Sequera: A. As for analysis.

543
01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:36.250
Orlando Sequera: that's also a risk notification technique. You evaluate

544
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:46.639
Orlando Sequera: strength and weaknesses, but you also identify at the bottom opportunities and threats. I'm. Going to impose the chat for a minute.

545
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.050
Orlando Sequera: What are opportunities and threats?

546
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.439
Orlando Sequera: What are opportunities and threats?

547
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.759
Orlando Sequera: We talked about that a few minutes ago

548
01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:03.909
Orlando Sequera: by performing a sort of analysis. What are opportunities and threats, risks, positive risk and negative risk? Correct.

549
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.980
Orlando Sequera: Correct. So when you are performing

550
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.689
Orlando Sequera: as short analysis.

551
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.850
Orlando Sequera: You, i'm going to post the chat

552
01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:16.030
Orlando Sequera: when you're performing a sort analysis. You are identifying risks.

553
01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:28.340
Orlando Sequera: whether you knew it or not. But that's why we have it here as of race, identification or not. Then you can create an affinity diagram to put them together and let's go over some of them.

554
01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:32.390
Orlando Sequera: The prom list. You want to get people to talk.

555
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:37.850
Orlando Sequera: A prom list is just a specific category, so you can get people to talk like

556
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:52.789
Orlando Sequera: pesto vuka categories. You want to get people to talk based, we risk can be environmental or legal, or could be technical, for example, multiple ways that you do that. But you want to get people to talk promly. It is a really good way.

557
01:02:52.810 --> 01:03:11.590
Orlando Sequera: You can use affinity diagrams that is taking those brainstorming sessions to another level. Start grouping large numbers of ideas in this case of our race notification, so you can group them together to avoid duplication, and then you can start generating new ideas one

558
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:20.010
Orlando Sequera: another technique that you can use. And please remember this one, which is what we call a Delphi technique. You can send

559
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.220
Orlando Sequera: questioners and surveys

560
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:30.769
Orlando Sequera: to your stakeholders and team members. Because, remember what happened, what we, what we mentioned, that happens in a group setting

561
01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:35.160
Orlando Sequera: You're going to have extroverts, and you're going to have introverts.

562
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:40.209
Orlando Sequera: Introverts might feel intimidated to provide their input in a group setting. But

563
01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:44.679
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to requirements, and when it comes to risk identification. We want to get

564
01:03:45.020 --> 01:04:00.900
Orlando Sequera: free ones. So that's why we use so many techniques to gather their input and what is that? They'll fight technique? This is a question that we're going to send. They can respond anonymously. They don't even have to give their name, but they can respond anonymously.

565
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:09.189
Orlando Sequera: and by doing that they're going to be able to provide, and the goal with the they'll find technique is to rich consensus about a risk.

566
01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:26.069
Orlando Sequera: and you can send it as many times as possible. If you're if you have a if you haven't been able to reach consent to put it so, basically sending a questioner anonymously to gather that feedback. So multiple tools, multiple techniques that you can use

567
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:26.859
Orlando Sequera: to

568
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.970
Orlando Sequera: identified risk.

569
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.930
Okay.

570
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.800
Orlando Sequera: so super important. And then we have to review documentation.

571
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.589
Orlando Sequera: Then we have to

572
01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.400
Orlando Sequera: go over the assumptions.

573
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:47.209
Orlando Sequera: Remember something that we take to be true without having evidence. We have to validate that because if our assumptions are not as accurate as possible.

574
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:52.789
Orlando Sequera: We're adding risk to our project. So we have to evaluate all of that, all of that

575
01:04:53.980 --> 01:05:08.309
Orlando Sequera: in in some cases. And I the last bullet here about Monte Carlo simulation that is usually for larger organizations. NASA uses that that is complex. When we, when we talked about risk analysis

576
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:11.499
Orlando Sequera: following a quantitative approach.

577
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:31.510
Orlando Sequera: Those simulations, in some cases, when we're talking about a very, a lot of complexity, we use something that is called Monte Carlo simulation, to evaluate thousands of possible scenarios. That's what I use for, but it can help in. In some cases it helps to identify risks as possible, but it's not used normally in

578
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.719
Orlando Sequera: normal, in regular organization, in in most industries is not used

579
01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.219
Orlando Sequera: all right.

580
01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:40.970
Orlando Sequera: And

581
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:57.599
Orlando Sequera: the same way that we did with the work that we have to complete for a project our scope when we create the work breakdown structure. Here we're going to use the same principle. Okay, we have a risk. But we have to classify those risks into different areas.

582
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:09.750
Orlando Sequera: Same principle that we use with the war breakdown structure. For that we use what we call a risk, breakdown structure, or rbs, so we can categorize those risks, and then we can start

583
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.159
Orlando Sequera: making sure that we're covering them, the ones that we have

584
01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.390
Orlando Sequera: that that we can

585
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.389
Orlando Sequera: the ones that we have to focus on. Do you see here, on level one, the different categories?

586
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:36.019
Orlando Sequera: And then it gets a little bit more specific as we go higher. This is, of course, one example. There are multiple templates out there for a race breakdown structure. If you want to get additional templates on that my recommendation, if you are a Pmi member.

587
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:51.029
Orlando Sequera: which I will strongly suggest you to become one. If you are not one already. You can go to project management.com, and there is a plethora of templates and tools in a in that URL Project management.

588
01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.080
Orlando Sequera: all right.

589
01:06:55.670 --> 01:07:03.199
Orlando Sequera: And now that takes us to measuring the assessment risk. But before that we're going to take our first break we're ready for a break.

590
01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.509
Orlando Sequera: Let's take our first break. And when we come back we're gonna come. We're gonna.

591
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.350
Orlando Sequera: I want to address some of the questions that you might have.

592
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:12.810
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to continue with our

593
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.659
Orlando Sequera: with our class. All right, so

594
01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:17.810
Orlando Sequera: enjoy your break.

595
01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.340
Orlando Sequera: We'll be back in 10 min.

596
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.349
Orlando Sequera: I would like to address some of the questions

597
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:36.439
Orlando Sequera: that

598
01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:40.179
Orlando Sequera: we have in the Q. And a.

599
01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.680
Orlando Sequera: Before we continue

600
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.119
Orlando Sequera: All right. I see a couple of questions

601
01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.290
Orlando Sequera: that are

602
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:00.110
Orlando Sequera: about positive risks.

603
01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.509
Orlando Sequera: And

604
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:13.830
Orlando Sequera: basically, as I said before, organizations tend to focus on what can go wrong with the project right? What I mentioned with the hurricane.

605
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:22.189
Orlando Sequera: for example, then, that can have a negative impact on the project, and we will like to be ready for those negative risks that we called

606
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.450
Orlando Sequera: threats.

607
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.189
Orlando Sequera: But in many cases there are opportunities.

608
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:29.989
Orlando Sequera: positive risks, and it's becoming more and more prevalent.

609
01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.490
Orlando Sequera: For example.

610
01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:45.530
Orlando Sequera: we if you're working in a construction company and you start using a different type of material. I'm just talking about. Ha! Hy hypothetically speaking, and you start seeing that Wow! By using this type of

611
01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:46.580
Orlando Sequera: paint

612
01:08:46.630 --> 01:09:03.530
Orlando Sequera: we can not only not only reduce the cost is cheaper, and we can finish the the work, the the pain in jobs quicker than before than using the previous pain that we use. We see some opportunity there. So let's

613
01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:11.100
Orlando Sequera: what let's analyze it, and let's try to see if this can be something, if if we can use it

614
01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:30.210
Orlando Sequera: from this point on so new materials. For with different applications that happens a lot in construction or different ways, or by using this new tool, we can not only create if we're talking about software development, or we started using this tool, and we can generate reports, and it can help us with

615
01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:38.549
Orlando Sequera: customer relationship management to Crm: we don't. Have. We have a separate Crm. Then there might be an opportunity there, a positive risk

616
01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:40.550
Orlando Sequera: that we can

617
01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:51.110
Orlando Sequera: that we can implement in the organization so, or in our project. We're talking about the context of our project. So those opportunities for positive risks

618
01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:56.219
Orlando Sequera: you might not necessarily be looking for them. But

619
01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:14.139
Orlando Sequera: you don't have to act on them. We're gonna when we talk about responses is going to become more evident. But there are opportunities same way that we have negative risk or threats. They are going to be. Opportunities and organizations are starting to shift

620
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.179
Orlando Sequera: from

621
01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.320
Orlando Sequera: they

622
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:25.099
Orlando Sequera: traditional approach of only paying attention to the negative risks or threats, and being every in a reactive mode.

623
01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:34.949
Orlando Sequera: and trying to be a also paying attention to possible opportunities because they can. These opportunities can can translate into reducing

624
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:38.679
Orlando Sequera: or saving saving money and time

625
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:45.060
Orlando Sequera: or increase in profit. So they're paying attention to those opportunities more and more, and

626
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:50.309
Orlando Sequera: a bottom line. There are more more organizations that are

627
01:10:50.340 --> 01:11:10.109
Orlando Sequera: paying close attention or pharmaceutical companies in their studies, in the in their medical trials. When they're trying a new drug, they can find some interesting opportunities, and they can go after them. So those are possible positive risks. Okay. So it happens in multiple industries. You can might find a better way of doing things that can be replicated

628
01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:23.060
Orlando Sequera: in the organization for other projects. It doesn't have to be a major breakthrough. It can be something as simple as following a different approach that can be replicated. That's an opportunity. So multiple of opportunities.

629
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:30.419
Orlando Sequera: Are they going to go after all of them? No, the answer is going to go back to the risk appetite and the risk threshold

630
01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:35.739
Orlando Sequera: a that the organization has in place. But multiple of our trees

631
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:41.490
Orlando Sequera: more positive risks, a, of course, multiple negative risks or threats.

632
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.110
Orlando Sequera: Okay? So that answers

633
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.410
Orlando Sequera: the

634
01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.949
Orlando Sequera: that answers that question.

635
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:49.070
Orlando Sequera: And

636
01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.200
Orlando Sequera: okay, so that answers that question.

637
01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.080
Orlando Sequera: Another question. Utilizing all these tools

638
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:33.010
Orlando Sequera: A. As a product manager to to navigate a product successfully. How long does it take to put together a solid for your plan? It depends on the project that's specific to the project, hey? The more complex your project is, and the key on the key is going to be in this scope. It depends on the complexity of the project.

639
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.010
Orlando Sequera: let's see what else we have

640
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:57.780
Orlando Sequera: business or systemic risk was not mentioned. That's another question to chat. Where is that type of risk? That might be a category. If that's important in your context in your organization, you have to a work on identifying those risks

641
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:17.789
Orlando Sequera: in the example of the new pain. Will the team also consider the risk of new materials to me? Expectation. But you wanna

642
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.449
Orlando Sequera: yes, that's it. It can go either way it can go either way.

643
01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:26.660
Orlando Sequera: Sure answer is yes.

644
01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.759
Orlando Sequera: Can you have

645
01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:45.340
Orlando Sequera: just positive risks? Not just positive risk. Usually you have both in any project. You have pro positive risks and negative risks.

646
01:13:55.010 --> 01:14:11.559
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the exam. Will we be required to a term predictor from Agile? The scenario question is going to give you some hints. It's not to be. It's not going to be straightforward. You have to read this. Another question to understand. Oh, is this referring to,

647
01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:18.659
Orlando Sequera: and as an adaptive approach, or to a predictive approach, you have to be able to discern and

648
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.940
Orlando Sequera: understand, based on the information that is given to you. What type of scenario are they talking about?

649
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.730
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and

650
01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.710
Orlando Sequera: can the positive risk become a threat?

651
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:43.050
Hmm.

652
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.890
Orlando Sequera: I'm not gonna say no. But usually that doesn't happen it's a positive risk.

653
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:58.779
Orlando Sequera: It could happen, but you have to identify positive risk and negative negative risk for your project. Don't. Overthink it at this point Don't overthink it.

654
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.410
Okay.

655
01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:22.710
Orlando Sequera: all right, let's continue.

656
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:32.119
Orlando Sequera: But one also. One thing that I wanted to point out, and i'm surprised that it Hasn't come up in? The questions are all risk identified, and we said, No.

657
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:43.209
Orlando Sequera: Some risks, even though we use multiple techniques for risk identification. Not all. We're not going to be able to identify

658
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:49.440
Orlando Sequera: every single risk. And I'm going to use a real life example to explain that that is going to

659
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:50.460
Orlando Sequera: a

660
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:58.159
Orlando Sequera: that. It's gonna help you in understanding. We should be able to identify every single risk. I'm: so i'm i'm surprised that it didn't come up in the Q. A.

661
01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.370
Orlando Sequera: But anyways.

662
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:03.489
Orlando Sequera: before we move on to step number 2, which is assessing risk.

663
01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:12.780
Orlando Sequera: There are, it happens, all the time we are not going to be able to identify every single risk. I'm going to give you an example.

664
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.459
Orlando Sequera: This in 2,011.

665
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:26.200
Orlando Sequera: Some of you might remember. Some of you might not remember. But there was a major nuclear reactor disaster in Fukushima, Japan.

666
01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.130
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

667
01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:29.170
Orlando Sequera: And let me give you a little bit of context.

668
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:31.180
Orlando Sequera: Japan has

669
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:32.550
Orlando Sequera: due to the fact

670
01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:41.679
Orlando Sequera: located in an area that is very prom to earthquakes. They have the strictest building code when it comes to new core plants

671
01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.689
Orlando Sequera: because they are locating a region in the world that is very prone to earthquakes.

672
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.150
Orlando Sequera: earthquakes.

673
01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:53.630
Orlando Sequera: The earthquake is not the risk. That is the trigger event. Okay, so

674
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:56.729
Orlando Sequera: they have the strictest building code

675
01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.580
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to.

676
01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:07.040
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to building nuclear nuclear plants, Not even here in the States, not even Europe. They have the strictest building code.

677
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:10.789
Orlando Sequera: So when they build the Fukushima reactor plan.

678
01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.540
Orlando Sequera: they were the Fukushima plan.

679
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:18.810
Orlando Sequera: They, of course, followed those guidelines, and they

680
01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.980
Orlando Sequera: perform this risk.

681
01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:27.039
Orlando Sequera: Identification process. This is a used in multiple industries, including that one.

682
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.379
Orlando Sequera: and they were able to

683
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.829
Orlando Sequera: identify one major risk due to the fact that they are

684
01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:54.369
Orlando Sequera: in a in an area that is prone to earthquakes, losing power, the risk of losing power due to an earthquake. Right? That's a major risk. A major threat for any nuclear plant, because if the reactors lose power, then they're gonna overheat, and that's when we have

685
01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.670
Orlando Sequera: a disaster.

686
01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:09.280
Orlando Sequera: So they were able to identify that risk, of course, that wasn't the only one they were multiple risk. But that's the one that we're going to focus on. And they came up with that response. For that risk they they measure that risk

687
01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:24.989
Orlando Sequera: which is what we're going to cover in a few minutes right now. In the next slide they measure the impact from both perspective, from the qualitative perspective, and also from the quantitative perspective, and they determine our response for that risk.

688
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.460
Orlando Sequera: since the probability of occurrence was high and the impact was high.

689
01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:37.789
Orlando Sequera: They use mitigation as a response. We're going to cover the different responses that we have for risks.

690
01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:42.450
Orlando Sequera: and the response was mitigation in this case, and

691
01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:44.719
Orlando Sequera: it consisted of

692
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:46.500
Orlando Sequera: having back up

693
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:55.259
Orlando Sequera: backup power is that in the event of them losing power due to an earthquake, then this back up

694
01:18:55.310 --> 01:19:02.449
Orlando Sequera: backup plans will provide power to the generators, so they could continue working

695
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:05.499
Orlando Sequera: when in 2,011,

696
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:12.179
Orlando Sequera: the earthquake that we, I think it was 9 in Richter scale, humongous.

697
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:13.639
Orlando Sequera: earthquake.

698
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.349
Orlando Sequera: very powerful

699
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.520
Orlando Sequera: they. The event unfortunately, occurred

700
01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:19.740
Orlando Sequera: then.

701
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:23.349
Orlando Sequera: The risk mitigation in place worked

702
01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:24.420
Orlando Sequera: properly.

703
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.229
Orlando Sequera: They lost power.

704
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:28.700
Orlando Sequera: Then the backup generators

705
01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.030
Orlando Sequera: worked

706
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:31.670
Orlando Sequera: as intended.

707
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.740
Orlando Sequera: and

708
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:42.839
Orlando Sequera: they were able to provide continue to provide power to to to generators. But there was a risk that wasn't identified, unfortunately.

709
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:46.409
Orlando Sequera: and this risk on a daily 5

710
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.460
Orlando Sequera: West

711
01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:50.780
Orlando Sequera: the risk of flooding due to a tsunami.

712
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.370
Orlando Sequera: That's what caused the problem. Unfortunately in the

713
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.719
Orlando Sequera: and they were not

714
01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:12.469
Orlando Sequera: that risk? That risk was not in the risk register. They were not identified. They were not able to identify. But the fact that we're not able they were not able to identify, didn't mean that it didn't exist. It did exist, and it had all the consequences that we

715
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.809
Orlando Sequera: that we're very well aware of

716
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.889
Orlando Sequera: they.

717
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:36.219
Orlando Sequera: But the tsunami was the the trigger event, and flooding the reactors flooded, and they lost power due to that. And we know the consequences of that flooding. What happened. So that's what happened. Even in that case, when Japan had the strictest building code for

718
01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.740
Orlando Sequera: a nuclear plant.

719
01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:43.989
Orlando Sequera: they still had risks that were not a identified

720
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.170
Orlando Sequera: and

721
01:20:45.400 --> 01:21:01.799
Orlando Sequera: disasters can happen. So it happens if we happen to them, it can happen to any industry. Can it any happens all the time. So we have to be very. We have to be cognizant, and we have to acknowledge the fact, the fact that even though we're doing

722
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:11.139
Orlando Sequera: as much as possible when it comes to risk and identification as we should, we have to come to a conclusion that there are going to be some risks

723
01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:24.899
Orlando Sequera: out there that we're not going to be able to identify. But the fact that we were not able to identify them does not mean that they're not lurking out. There they are, and how can we address them by using the management reserves.

724
01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:34.149
Orlando Sequera: management reserves, set amount of money, and a set of amount of time that will help us to address those unidentified risks. Okay.

725
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:35.829
Orlando Sequera: So when it comes to

726
01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:39.719
Orlando Sequera: working with risks, now that we worked with

727
01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.319
Orlando Sequera: step number one which is identifying risks and try to build

728
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:47.209
Orlando Sequera: a risk, register that list of risks

729
01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:58.490
Orlando Sequera: as far as possible. Try to identify as many risk as possible. The second step, when it comes to re risk management is to analyze those Fr. We have to assess them.

730
01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:06.399
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And the first type of assessment that we have to perform is what we call qualitative risk, analysis

731
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.929
Orlando Sequera: or qualitative assessment.

732
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:18.220
Orlando Sequera: And what we're trying to determine is because we have to prioritize this risks. Remember that we don't have unlimited resources. Yes.

733
01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.860
Orlando Sequera: it. There are. Some say that a opportunity

734
01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.279
Orlando Sequera: we can benefit from multiple opportunities, but

735
01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:36.709
Orlando Sequera: we have to go back to the constraints of our project. We have limited resources. We have a set amount of money and a set amount of time to complete the work, and we have to per. That means that we have to prioritize

736
01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:46.109
Orlando Sequera: that that is also applicable to risk. So we need to understand the 2 factors that we said that we study when it comes to risks. Those are probability and impact.

737
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.240
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And we start with a qualitative

738
01:22:49.260 --> 01:23:08.750
Orlando Sequera: approach based on what based based on mainly the experience of a subject matter experts that is more of a subjective analysis that step number one. But then, after that we're going to perform a second type of analysis, which is what we call quantitative. We're going to use data.

739
01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.040
Orlando Sequera: not just experience or expertise. We're gonna use data. So

740
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:20.949
Orlando Sequera: those are the 2 types of analysis that we're going to perform when it comes to a risk. Management

741
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:22.340
Orlando Sequera: in

742
01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:31.979
Orlando Sequera: the goal is to understand. This is a an example of a probability impact matrix. The goal is to understand

743
01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:39.959
Orlando Sequera: what is what are those risks that have a high probability and high impact for both

744
01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:57.970
Orlando Sequera: opportunities and threats. Many organizations only focus on threats, but we have to before the exam. Remember, we have to look at it from the negative risk, perspective, or threat, but we also have to look at it from the positive risk or opportunity as well. Okay.

745
01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:02.529
Orlando Sequera: But the goal is to understand, and we start to pray because we we have to rearrange

746
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.650
Orlando Sequera: that

747
01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:24.750
Orlando Sequera: risk register the risks that have the high probability high impact. They need to go at the top. But we have to analyze them first and many organizations. This is just an example of a risk, probability and impact definition. To understand this can change from organization to organization. If you have a Pmo in place.

748
01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:40.650
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna be your source to get this information. But organizations have this in place. They understand they have the scale of impact and probability, so you can use that accordingly. And what you're going to be using is

749
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:44.440
Orlando Sequera: you're going to be placing your risks

750
01:24:44.880 --> 01:25:10.679
Orlando Sequera: in this probability and impact matrix. But in a subjective way, right? You're working mainly with your team members to be working. Who's going to be doing this? Mainly your. You can work with some stakeholders, but it's going to be mainly the subject matter experts. The people that are doing the work. They have face similar situations in the past. They can help you with this, but the goal is to understand. We have to prioritize. This is how we can rearrange that

751
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:19.559
Orlando Sequera: risk register to make sure that anything that has high probability and high impact. Anything in the red has to go at

752
01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:34.830
Orlando Sequera: to the top of your risk register. Okay, that risk of floating in If we're building the one story house in South Florida and the risk of structural damage, those go to the top, because that's going to be a high probability every year. We have a hurricane season

753
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:45.920
Orlando Sequera: in South Florida. That's just a fact of life. And then the impact to the project to this construction project is high, so those are in the red. Anything in the red

754
01:25:45.930 --> 01:26:04.740
Orlando Sequera: that has to go to the top of your a of your race register, and then you have medium risk that's going to be in in the middle section of your risk register, and then the ones that have a low, pretty, low impact. They're going at the bottom, you may. You might be wondering every single reason we should be able to address them.

755
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:09.909
Orlando Sequera: We have limited resources. That's why you have to prioritize. Okay.

756
01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:15.390
Orlando Sequera: And this is an example of a race register. It's another spreadsheet.

757
01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:16.539
Orlando Sequera: That's what you have

758
01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:22.470
Orlando Sequera: with multiple columns. It's a list of risks, a running list of risks that has

759
01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.890
Orlando Sequera: the description of the risk.

760
01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:30.749
Orlando Sequera: the description of the possible impact. And this is just an example. These changes multiple templates out there.

761
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:36.769
Orlando Sequera: The impact score probability, this core that was assigned by the team.

762
01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:43.359
Orlando Sequera: the trigger condition could be. what's going to be that event that could trigger this risk

763
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.590
Orlando Sequera: the plan response

764
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:53.329
Orlando Sequera: in an important piece of information. Every single risk in your risk register has to have

765
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:55.110
Orlando Sequera: a risk owner.

766
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.719
Orlando Sequera: Someone has to be assigned to a particular risk, because

767
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:11.939
Orlando Sequera: if that risk comes to fruition, and if we're talking about a negative risk, for example, and it comes to fruition. It needs to be addressed, meaning that the response that we identify

768
01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:31.209
Orlando Sequera: has to be implemented, and there has to be an owner. Okay, this is super super super important. So all your risk. We only have 3 here. I wish I had that locking my projects, but it can be multiple. It can be depending on your project. You're going to have it's a it could be a long list, but you gotta make sure that you have

769
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:35.910
Orlando Sequera: a risk owner. That is an important piece of information. Okay.

770
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.550
Orlando Sequera: And we start that version one

771
01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.960
Orlando Sequera: with your

772
01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:53.019
Orlando Sequera: with your qualitative type of analysis. So we start rearranging, but it's subjective right. It's subjective.

773
01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.790
Orlando Sequera: In addition to to the the

774
01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:02.240
Orlando Sequera: the risk Register a imag on projects. We teams, as I mentioned before can add

775
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:19.859
Orlando Sequera: this information to a an information radiator. So it is available. Another column in the Information radiator with the risks that we're able that they were able to identify, so they can address that in the subsequent iterations. Okay.

776
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:24.530
Orlando Sequera: is some of the columns you can tailor this risk register it.

777
01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:42.530
Orlando Sequera: The type of status that they the day that it wasn't open or identified the day that it was resolved. So you can. You can close risk if they come to Fr. On their address, you can close them. And and the resolution strategy that might help you with with with lessons learned in the future.

778
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.150
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

779
01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:46.900
Orlando Sequera: And then the next type of analysis

780
01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:52.160
Orlando Sequera: or assessment that we have to perform for risk is going to be quantitative.

781
01:28:52.900 --> 01:29:05.540
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna point out that not every single organization that every single industry performs a tie, a quantitative risk analysis. But for the purposes of the exam

782
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:14.780
Orlando Sequera: you have to assume that you're going to use both. You're going to use the qualitative risk assessment. Possibly some of you that are working pretty much right now

783
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:28.970
Orlando Sequera: have used the probability an impact matrix, and that's what you use. That's one way. Most organizations use that. But in some cases some industries they need a little bit more than just a subjective type of analysis. They need data.

784
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:29.840
Orlando Sequera: so

785
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:35.660
Orlando Sequera: industries like airspace and weather forecasting, they use

786
01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:38.040
Orlando Sequera: a quantitative risk analysis.

787
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:43.040
Orlando Sequera: The Monte Carlo simulation is the classic example of

788
01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.660
Orlando Sequera: one itator of risk analysis

789
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:51.149
Orlando Sequera: for those of you that like weather forecasting, for example.

790
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:54.700
Orlando Sequera: when a storm is coming, a hurricane is coming.

791
01:29:55.460 --> 01:30:06.710
Orlando Sequera: We have this and this is something very common in in in in most places. You're watching the news at night, and you want to understand the possible path of the hurricane.

792
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:23.779
Orlando Sequera: Well, in order to determine the possible path, and then you start seeing something. They have to become more and more popular. Those spaghetti models that show a possible trajectory, and you see the the the European path is saying that it's the hurricane. It's going to go this way and that. You start seeing other

793
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:39.600
Orlando Sequera: possible paths. And it it is. It's pretty much like a spaghetti ball that you see the possible lines, and then they try to determine the cone of uncertainty for the hurricane. All of that is done using a Monte Carlo simulation that analyzes

794
01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.900
Orlando Sequera: thousands of possible scenarios

795
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:53.180
Orlando Sequera: thousands. This needs to be done using computers specialized equipment. This is not done by hand. They analyze thousands of possible scenarios.

796
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:59.829
Orlando Sequera: That's how they're able to determine that kind of uncertainty for the hurricane based on the information that they have.

797
01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:03.780
Orlando Sequera: Okay, this cannot be done by hand. Another example is

798
01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.769
Orlando Sequera: airspace.

799
01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:19.390
Orlando Sequera: This the spacecraft Orion for the art of this program was built and designed mainly by Lock it, Martin. They're the ones in charge of Orion. That is their a contribution main contribution

800
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.250
Orlando Sequera: to the a this program.

801
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:24.279
Orlando Sequera: and in order to build a spacecraft.

802
01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.290
Orlando Sequera: they had to replicate conditions of outer space.

803
01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:31.429
Orlando Sequera: and they can do that through simulation

804
01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:44.440
Orlando Sequera: or this type of risk analysis to understand what happens. If the pressure changes, what happens is the temperature changes. What is going to be the impact on the spacecraft, so for that. They use complicated simulations and they use

805
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:51.039
Orlando Sequera: Hmm. A computer models to replicate those effects of outer space.

806
01:31:51.840 --> 01:32:03.189
Orlando Sequera: In understand the impact of pressures and the impacts of changes in temperatures, etc. And multiple changes in different conditions. So for that they use simulations that's a type of

807
01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:05.250
Orlando Sequera: quantitative risk analysis.

808
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.180
Orlando Sequera: All the industries that use this

809
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:21.050
Orlando Sequera: insurance. They also use it a lot, so they perform in the financial industry. They use it a lot as well. But You're trying to understand more when you need to understand multiple

810
01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:33.419
Orlando Sequera: thousands of possible scenarios and try to determine the best they they most. the high probability high impact risks in this case do you use a quantitative type of analysis? Okay?

811
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:41.220
Orlando Sequera: And there other type of quantitative type of analysis. We see the tornado diagram which is comparing

812
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:42.769
Orlando Sequera: A.

813
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:46.850
Orlando Sequera: They relative importance. It can be a positive and negative

814
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:48.940
Orlando Sequera: for the different risks.

815
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.400
Orlando Sequera: A. Also, this is

816
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.830
Orlando Sequera: you have.

817
01:32:53.210 --> 01:33:01.660
Orlando Sequera: the sensitivity, analysis, tornado, the tornado diagram that I just mentioned. So there are multiple a ways.

818
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.149
Orlando Sequera: sensitivity, analysis. You can determine

819
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:10.089
Orlando Sequera: which individual for the race or other sources have the most potential impact on product outcomes.

820
01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:19.219
Orlando Sequera: And, as I mentioned before, we talked about the simulation, the Monte Carlo simulation classic example. If you ever see something in the exam about monicar simulation o

821
01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:23.680
Orlando Sequera: quantitative risk analysis and simulation as well.

822
01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.590
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So we analyze risk

823
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:28.929
Orlando Sequera: from 2 perspective.

824
01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.470
Orlando Sequera: Let me go back one.

825
01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.639
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And

826
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:59.379
Orlando Sequera: we also have 4 predictive projects. Remember, pay attention to the symbol. Here we have other tools. We have decision 3 analysis that's going to help us to make some decisions and evaluate multiple branches. We have influence diagrams, and we also have one that is going to help us understand

827
01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:01.360
Orlando Sequera: the expected monetary value

828
01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:04.749
Orlando Sequera: decision, 3 analysis, the diagram.

829
01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:06.559
Orlando Sequera: a diagram in technique

830
01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:11.780
Orlando Sequera: that can help us to understand the implications of multiple options.

831
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:18.410
Orlando Sequera: Influence diagrams, can help in the decision making process. You try to understand the impact

832
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:24.130
Orlando Sequera: and the root cost of certain problems and try to start relating multiple variables

833
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:26.480
Orlando Sequera: or variables. My apologies

834
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:30.680
Orlando Sequera: and spect the monetary value. That is.

835
01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.270
Orlando Sequera: technique that we use to understand

836
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:36.689
Orlando Sequera: the monetary value of

837
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:40.680
Orlando Sequera: choosing a particular alternative over another one

838
01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:51.740
Orlando Sequera: by following basically a decision 3, and place in monetary value in both options. So we have multiple ways that we can use

839
01:34:51.930 --> 01:34:52.809
Orlando Sequera: 4

840
01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:57.829
Orlando Sequera: predictive this is for predictive. If we're following a predictive approach

841
01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:05.789
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to risks.

842
01:35:07.450 --> 01:35:11.790
Orlando Sequera: And this is a question that I have that i'm going to. I'm past the chat, for

843
01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:15.590
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to risks. Do you think that

844
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.669
Orlando Sequera: for addicted projects are most often affected by the impact of cost-related risks?

845
01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:28.659
Orlando Sequera: And, on the other hand, add their projects are affected by the impact of time related risks

846
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.389
Orlando Sequera: the chat has been in.

847
01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:39.969
Orlando Sequera: So

848
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:51.449
Orlando Sequera: in for in I see i'm gonna i'm gonna post the chat. So thank you for your replies.

849
01:35:53.180 --> 01:36:00.289
Orlando Sequera: and in in many cases yes, but we have to when it comes to risk. And the whole point of this

850
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:08.630
Orlando Sequera: 2 questions we we can. When it comes to risk management, we have to have an open mind. We have to

851
01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:28.549
Orlando Sequera: in some cases. Yes, this might be your your first indication, but we gotta look at a case by case. Risk can come in any way, shape or form. We have to have an open mind when it comes to risk. This might be true in some cases, but it's not always going to be the case, so we have to be it thorough when it comes to

852
01:36:28.710 --> 01:36:31.519
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to that. And

853
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:34.139
Orlando Sequera: you might have

854
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:51.229
Orlando Sequera: some race that are more common for situations, but in most cases I will tend to agree that this is a true statement initially. But the point here is that you get it. Don't. Stay on the assumption. Only validate your assumption you, if you think that this is true, just

855
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.150
if

856
01:36:52.220 --> 01:37:03.439
Orlando Sequera: that is not a replacement for an answer, you have to be very specific. You have to be a very careful when it comes to a when it comes to risk management. Okay, Don't. Go just with your

857
01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.619
Orlando Sequera: with your assumption, with your what your God is telling you. Go

858
01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:09.839
Orlando Sequera: to analyze identified risks.

859
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.809
Orlando Sequera: They are specific to your project.

860
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.290
Orlando Sequera: Okay, the first step. So we analyze risks. So step number one, identifying risks.

861
01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:22.790
Orlando Sequera: Step number 2,

862
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:23.800
Orlando Sequera: if

863
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:26.639
Orlando Sequera: is analyzing risks.

864
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:32.269
Orlando Sequera: but it has 2 types of analysis. 2: a is

865
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.989
Orlando Sequera: qualitative risk. Analysis

866
01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:41.330
Orlando Sequera: is subjective. To be is quantitative risk analysis. So the first step.

867
01:37:41.530 --> 01:37:43.709
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to risk management is

868
01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:49.929
Orlando Sequera: coming up with that response. What do we do? Okay, Great. We identify our risks. We analyze it

869
01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.479
Orlando Sequera: quantitatively and qualitatively. What do we do now?

870
01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:56.320
Orlando Sequera: That's where the responses are going to come into play.

871
01:37:56.950 --> 01:38:02.220
Orlando Sequera: This is what we're going to implement. This is what we're going to do. If those risks come to fruition

872
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:07.770
Orlando Sequera: a risk responses ideally, and this is our best practices, they should be

873
01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:19.949
Orlando Sequera: appropriate to the risk. They should be cost-effective, because we need time and money to implement this responses. So we have to be we're the stewards of the schedule and the stewards off the budget over

874
01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:32.440
Orlando Sequera: as a project manager. So they got to be cost-effective. They have to be realistic within the project context. That's why we prioritize our risk register. Okay, they have to get they. We have to be.

875
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:36.429
Orlando Sequera: We have to be on the same page with our stakeholders.

876
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:44.090
Orlando Sequera: and we need to have a designated risk owner for every single risk. These are good practices. Remember this for the exam.

877
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:48.770
Orlando Sequera: and also for your daily life as a project manager

878
01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.370
Orlando Sequera: going back to some terminology for risk responses.

879
01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:56.889
Orlando Sequera: a trigger condition, sickness that at risk can develop.

880
01:38:57.030 --> 01:39:04.939
Orlando Sequera: There's a hurricane in the Atlantic that is coming this way to the eastern coast of the Us. If you're in construction.

881
01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:08.319
Orlando Sequera: you want to make sure that you are

882
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:10.490
Orlando Sequera: that you are ready for that.

883
01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:18.820
Orlando Sequera: If that if the risk comes to fridge or risk of structural damage, for example, or risk of flooding, you have to implement

884
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.669
Orlando Sequera: the risk response. However.

885
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:25.630
Orlando Sequera: when you implement risk responses. You might create

886
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.860
Orlando Sequera: all the risks.

887
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:35.130
Orlando Sequera: so that not all implementations of risk response implementations are going to be bulletproof. You might create some

888
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.130
Orlando Sequera: residual risk or a secondary risk.

889
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:44.549
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that that happens, you might create all the risks by implementing your response. That happens in some cases.

890
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:49.100
Orlando Sequera: or you may have some left over risk, which is what we call residual risk

891
01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.120
Orlando Sequera: that has to be addressed.

892
01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:59.650
Orlando Sequera: 4 risks that are high probability and high impact, specially threats or negative risks always have

893
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:03.289
Orlando Sequera: Plan B, which is what we call a contingency.

894
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:11.090
Orlando Sequera: In the event of that primary response not working, you're gonna have a plan. B: that's what we call a fall back or contingency.

895
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:12.760
Orlando Sequera: and

896
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:14.040
Orlando Sequera: we need

897
01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:24.189
Orlando Sequera: again to address this risks. We need 2 things: we need time and money. That's what we get with the contingency reserve. That's why we have

898
01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:34.419
Orlando Sequera: a contingency reserve in our schedule certain amount of time, and is also in our budget a certain amount of money that is going to help us to address the risks

899
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:44.809
Orlando Sequera: that we were able to identify to our project. You might be wondering if data set formula for contingency recepts. Nope, there's no a set formula is usually a percentage

900
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:45.590
Orlando Sequera: of

901
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:49.190
Orlando Sequera: your budget, and it is also affected

902
01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.400
Orlando Sequera: by the number of risks

903
01:40:51.490 --> 01:41:10.659
Orlando Sequera: that you have been able to identify, and it changes from industry to industry, from organization to organization. But it's usually expressed as a percentage I have seen in some cases, 5% of the button of the budget. I have seen it. 10%. It changes. Okay. But there's not a set.

904
01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:19.089
Orlando Sequera: But the point is that you need to have a set amount of money and a certain amount of time that will help you to address those risk and implement these responses.

905
01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:21.390
Orlando Sequera: What are the responses

906
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:24.910
Orlando Sequera: we have

907
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:28.660
Orlando Sequera: responses for? First of all, we have responses for

908
01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.000
Orlando Sequera: both

909
01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.400
Orlando Sequera: a

910
01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:37.350
Orlando Sequera: negative risks or threats, and we also have responses for positive risks or opportunities.

911
01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.660
Orlando Sequera: Escalation.

912
01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:42.170
Orlando Sequera: that is.

913
01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:45.030
Orlando Sequera: and we talked about escalation before

914
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:50.930
Orlando Sequera: it. That is the last resort. You should think of escalation as the last resort

915
01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:53.669
Orlando Sequera: whenever the threat

916
01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:58.340
Orlando Sequera: clearly clearly exceeds your authority as a project manager.

917
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:00.150
Orlando Sequera: Then

918
01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.850
Orlando Sequera: do you have to be?

919
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:04.169
Orlando Sequera: Then you can escalate to have

920
01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:05.670
Orlando Sequera: someone else

921
01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:19.119
Orlando Sequera: the sponsor, for example, or someone else with higher authority that can help you to address a this situation it's usually it's usually tied up to unidentified risks.

922
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:26.260
Orlando Sequera: In in many cases. What do we do? I I can. So I didn't plan for this. What can I do? For example?

923
01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:31.050
Orlando Sequera: a a a natural disaster that you

924
01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:41.289
Orlando Sequera: accounting for a major? Well, when we use the example of software, that again, a major earthquake in some further than you're in the construction department. This is a this is

925
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:55.080
Orlando Sequera: we don't have anything in the risk, for what do I do? Maybe in that case where we're going to have to we we have to escalate in that in that regard we we we can solve it with project management. We need other people to help

926
01:42:55.330 --> 01:42:57.660
Orlando Sequera: for the purposes of the exam

927
01:42:57.870 --> 01:43:11.299
Orlando Sequera: usually, and I mentioned that before, and I'm going to mention that again. Usually escalation is the wrong answer, because this collection implies that someone else is so it's going to solve the problem for you. Okay.

928
01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:12.870
Orlando Sequera: it is

929
01:43:13.050 --> 01:43:16.459
Orlando Sequera: an option in some cases, but it is not always

930
01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:23.689
Orlando Sequera: what you have when you can solve it as a project manager with your 30, then it is going to be the answer.

931
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.349
Orlando Sequera: Avoidance

932
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:27.300
Orlando Sequera: is going to be

933
01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:43.399
Orlando Sequera: it basically when you, If If the overall project risk is in this significantly negative and outside of the agreed upon risk threshold, then most it is important to you can avoid that. a

934
01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:52.079
Orlando Sequera: that area you can. You can avoid that er the scope, for example, that is crossing the risk is possible to do it, and that way you're going to reduce the possible.

935
01:43:52.180 --> 01:44:04.950
Orlando Sequera: the possible negative impact on the project. I remember that in an example in one of my projects it was about Pci compliance, personal credit card information.

936
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:18.940
Orlando Sequera: we were trying to store the goal West to store and Craig our information for an application that we were using for current information of our users, and they project West to make sure that we were pci compliant. It was part of the project

937
01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:20.550
Orlando Sequera: A, and

938
01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:24.850
Orlando Sequera: basically, we determine we were able to determine with experts that

939
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:28.090
Orlando Sequera: for pci compliance every single

940
01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:41.140
Orlando Sequera: and every single component of the the network had to be pci compliant. We didn't have the budget for that. So the answer was okay to was, avoid. We're going to avoid that risk

941
01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:45.809
Orlando Sequera: A. And we're not. We're gonna use a different a different approach.

942
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.240
Orlando Sequera: Transference is

943
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:57.020
Orlando Sequera: the classic example is when the impact of the risk you transfer it to a third party. The classic example is insurance.

944
01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.269
Orlando Sequera: or

945
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.010
Orlando Sequera: in that particular case of

946
01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:21.000
Orlando Sequera: my project. When we didn't we use avoidance. We decided not to be pci compliant. That was, we. We went with a different, with an alternate made, or ultimately that probably get canceled. But another option would have been transference if we were to use a third party, for example.

947
01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:22.610
Orlando Sequera: other companies that

948
01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:39.499
Orlando Sequera: want to provide services a to their customers, and this is widely popular. They don't want to deal with Pci compliance because it's very complex and costly. What they do is they use a third party. Their payments are received via paypal, or a, or

949
01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:58.329
Orlando Sequera: sale, or any of the other platforms or square, so that is an example of trans transference. You can transfer that risk to a third party. Insurance is another example of transference. So that is another option that you have, then the next one is probably the most popular one is mitigation

950
01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.460
Orlando Sequera: with mitigation. We try to

951
01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.710
Orlando Sequera: reduce the probability and impact

952
01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.929
Orlando Sequera: and mitigation is the recommended approach for high, probably high impact risks.

953
01:46:08.970 --> 01:46:11.940
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that is the recommended

954
01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.849
Orlando Sequera: A

955
01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:14.260
Orlando Sequera: approach

956
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:18.510
Orlando Sequera: we should board. Mitigation is not the only response.

957
01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:23.410
Orlando Sequera: and the last one is acceptance when you

958
01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:29.879
Orlando Sequera: we're able to identify the risk, but it's usually associated with low impact and low-privative risks.

959
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:38.719
Orlando Sequera: Then you just accept it, and those are going to be one. They want to go to the actual, a to the lower.

960
01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:58.510
Orlando Sequera: the to the bottom of the of the risk register. Okay, do you? If you have a risk that is high, probably high impact, for example, the risk of floating due to hurricanes in in South Florida that you're not going to use acceptance for that. You gotta use mitigation. Okay. So make sure that you use the right

961
01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:11.390
Orlando Sequera: the write up of response for the right risk. But you're not going to use mitigation for every single risk. You don't have the money in the time to do that. So you ha! That's why we prioritize okay. And, on the other hand, escalation

962
01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.450
Orlando Sequera: for opportunities. The same case you can

963
01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.469
Orlando Sequera: is there. There's a major opportunity, but you can. It's outside of the scope

964
01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:28.009
Orlando Sequera: and your authority. You'll have to escalate that to another, a to another party, so the opportunity can come to fruition

965
01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:34.159
Orlando Sequera: A. When it comes to exploit, it's the opposite of avoidance. It's doing whatever it takes to

966
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:45.189
Orlando Sequera: they to take advantage of the opportunity to change course, to change the scope you change whatever you need to change in order to make sure that that opportunity comes to fruition.

967
01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.430
Orlando Sequera: A sharing is

968
01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.750
Orlando Sequera: basically the same principle of transference.

969
01:47:51.820 --> 01:48:07.809
Orlando Sequera: Think of a joint venture. You might not have to identify the opportunity. But you don't have enough infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunity. Then you join forces with a third party organization to take advantage of the opportunity you might not have all the infrastructure in place.

970
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.400
Orlando Sequera: Enhancing is the opposite of mitigation.

971
01:48:11.530 --> 01:48:14.100
Orlando Sequera: What you try to do with enhance is

972
01:48:14.150 --> 01:48:21.949
Orlando Sequera: maximize the probability and impact of a possible opportunity. You see a great opportunity to make

973
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:32.620
Orlando Sequera: to, to to profit from from this. from this risk in this case, then you do whatever it takes to increase the probability and impact of that opportunity.

974
01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:35.360
Orlando Sequera: An acceptance is again the same.

975
01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.349
Orlando Sequera: and cities for negative risks.

976
01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:41.749
Orlando Sequera: If it happens great. If it doesn't happen.

977
01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.350
Orlando Sequera: If it happens, we'll

978
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:49.210
Orlando Sequera: we'll take it. But if it doesn't happen, it's okay. So we have responses for

979
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:55.370
Orlando Sequera: threats or negative risks, and we have responses for opportunities and positive risks.

980
01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:00.959
Orlando Sequera: And this is what we have covered so far.

981
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.670
Orlando Sequera: We went over the

982
01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:07.429
Orlando Sequera: 3 steps when it comes to risk. So it starts with risk identification.

983
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:23.020
Orlando Sequera: then risk assessment, and then we have, and the risk assessment is perform performing that we do it in 2 ways. We perform a qualitative type of analysis, and we perform a quantitative type of analysis.

984
01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:24.330
Orlando Sequera: And then

985
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:36.510
Orlando Sequera: we went over all of our pre compliance and possible threat to compliance. We have mentioned that before there are risk associated with compliance; and as we mentioned on day one that

986
01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.269
Orlando Sequera: important type of risks

987
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:40.530
Orlando Sequera: that has to be addressed.

988
01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:43.599
Orlando Sequera: You might be

989
01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:51.749
Orlando Sequera: wondering what type of questions am I going to get when it comes to risks. They're going to give you a scenario.

990
01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.279
Orlando Sequera: 2 types of questions. The

991
01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:59.320
Orlando Sequera: I ask you point blank. Which one do you think is the the actual next step.

992
01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.389
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume for a minute that we are.

993
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:04.200
Orlando Sequera: This is the situation

994
01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:06.900
Orlando Sequera: A.

995
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:09.979
Orlando Sequera: We knew that that could happen.

996
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:12.210
Orlando Sequera: We knew that that could happen.

997
01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:14.689
Orlando Sequera: We are

998
01:50:14.730 --> 01:50:21.059
Orlando Sequera: our our house. Our one story house is flooded, and there's some structure of damage

999
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:22.510
Orlando Sequera: A.

1000
01:50:23.530 --> 01:50:27.439
Orlando Sequera: And for we we knew that that could happen that that was a possibility.

1001
01:50:27.690 --> 01:50:30.779
Orlando Sequera: What should we do first?

1002
01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:37.149
Orlando Sequera: What should we do first? We are working a construction project to build a one-story house

1003
01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:38.910
Orlando Sequera: in South Florida.

1004
01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:41.609
Orlando Sequera: We knew that that was a possibility.

1005
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:44.839
Orlando Sequera: The structure flooded.

1006
01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:49.439
Orlando Sequera: What do we do first? I'm going to open the chat

1007
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.779
Orlando Sequera: right now. What do we do first?

1008
01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:55.940
Orlando Sequera: What do we do. First.

1009
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:21.350
Orlando Sequera: some of you are given the right answer the first step we knew that it was that it was a possibility. So let me start by saying, i'm going to post the chat right now.

1010
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:23.529
Orlando Sequera: Some of you got it correctly.

1011
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:38.980
Orlando Sequera: The what do we do? First we check the risk register. The scenario is giving you some hints. We knew that this was a possibility, so that means that we were able to identify the risk of floating, and it is somewhere. It is in

1012
01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:45.389
Orlando Sequera: the risk register. So what do we do? First pay attention to that keyword First

1013
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:51.410
Orlando Sequera: is check the risk register, as some of you a answer, and I see some of the answers

1014
01:51:51.630 --> 01:51:53.260
Orlando Sequera: A r

1015
01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:05.419
Orlando Sequera: mitigate efforts. No, that is, that that's already. The mitigation is already in the identified in the risk register. But the first step is to

1016
01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:24.079
Orlando Sequera: check the risk register. That has all that information. That's why we do this. We have to do this first before the before the risk can come to fruition. We do this. This is part of the planning efforts. This happens at the beginning of your project. You got to have this in place. You cannot be getting ready when the hurricane is on top of

1017
01:52:24.090 --> 01:52:38.990
Orlando Sequera: it's it's already on on top of your area. Right? We plan. We plan to be ready for that. A. For that possible risks. So no, we check the risk register. That is, first step. I'm going to ask another question.

1018
01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:42.950
Orlando Sequera: This is another type of question that you make it in your exempt.

1019
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:46.980
Orlando Sequera: We did not see that coming.

1020
01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:50.590
Orlando Sequera: We're let's assume that we're. We're building

1021
01:52:51.210 --> 01:52:55.810
Orlando Sequera: a house in the Nevada area near Las Vegas.

1022
01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:00.480
Orlando Sequera: and we did an account for the risk of flooding.

1023
01:53:00.850 --> 01:53:04.960
Orlando Sequera: But we're floating right now. What do we do first?

1024
01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:07.389
Orlando Sequera: What do we do? First?

1025
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:10.619
Orlando Sequera: We didn't see that one coming

1026
01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.899
Orlando Sequera: this weather is. Some heard of

1027
01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.579
Orlando Sequera: the structure flawed it.

1028
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:17.360
Orlando Sequera: What do we do. First

1029
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:27.869
Orlando Sequera: there is another.

1030
01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:31.260
Orlando Sequera: There is another

1031
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:34.019
Orlando Sequera: artifact that we can review.

1032
01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.719
Orlando Sequera: What do you do when your car breaks

1033
01:53:40.150 --> 01:53:43.460
Orlando Sequera: when you get a weird light, and your car breaks in the middle of the road.

1034
01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:51.790
Orlando Sequera: Okay, in this one. No, not not come on, not Google. It?

1035
01:53:53.290 --> 01:54:02.869
Orlando Sequera: So the answer is in the context of project management. You have to review the the users guide right? The owner, Sky, the owners may the Car manual.

1036
01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:08.970
Orlando Sequera: That's what you try to do to find out what that is in this case. In this context, for project management is

1037
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:14.080
Orlando Sequera: going to be your risk management plan. That's why we create risk management plan.

1038
01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:16.470
Orlando Sequera: That's what's gonna that's what we have to check.

1039
01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:21.799
Orlando Sequera: It's not in the register, because this is unheard of. We never have this type of weather in

1040
01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.820
Orlando Sequera: in the middle of the desert.

1041
01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.470
Orlando Sequera: Right? This is unheard of.

1042
01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:31.959
Orlando Sequera: We didn't account for this. It's not in the register. We were not able to identify it. We have to check the

1043
01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:35.679
Orlando Sequera: the risk management plan.

1044
01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:46.079
Orlando Sequera: That is our owner's Guy, the users guy that's what we have to check. Those are the type of questions that you're going to be getting in your exam. So about critical thinking, critical thinking. Okay.

1045
01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:47.150
Orlando Sequera: So

1046
01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:48.490
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1047
01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:56.420
Orlando Sequera: Now, we're going to continue with our next topic, and that is quality. We're going to talk about quality

1048
01:54:56.490 --> 01:55:00.850
Orlando Sequera: when I continue your journey. My recommendation again is, please take

1049
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:02.710
Orlando Sequera: practice questions

1050
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:11.480
Orlando Sequera: in test prep in Precipio. That's going to help you to address these scenarios for the questions on a straightforward like that. They are scenario based.

1051
01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:14.110
Orlando Sequera: and they're going to ask you keywords like.

1052
01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:17.540
Orlando Sequera: Do I do first what I? What do I do next?

1053
01:55:18.670 --> 01:55:27.740
Orlando Sequera: who should be in in, in, in, in, in? In this response. So look for the keywords. What is the best

1054
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:35.010
Orlando Sequera: approach or the best solution for this situation? Look for the keywords next first best.

1055
01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.949
Orlando Sequera: That is key. When you're reading the Pmp. Exam. Questions.

1056
01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.369
Orlando Sequera: all right quality

1057
01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.770
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to quality. This is

1058
01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:56.949
Orlando Sequera: it boils down the the the simplest definition of quality is, how Well, are we meeting

1059
01:55:57.110 --> 01:55:59.190
Orlando Sequera: the requirements? How well

1060
01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:05.329
Orlando Sequera: our deliverables are meeting the requirements. So quality is driven by

1061
01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.000
Orlando Sequera: the requirements. Okay, gonna petition to a requirement? So how well are we meeting those requirements?

1062
01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:13.940
Orlando Sequera: That is the level of quality.

1063
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:19.280
Orlando Sequera: There is a common misconception out there that people tend to confuse

1064
01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.009
Orlando Sequera: quality and great.

1065
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:22.420
Orlando Sequera: and for

1066
01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:27.199
Orlando Sequera: this example I would like to use 2 type of of

1067
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:32.750
Orlando Sequera: 2 type of cars. We're gonna use cars to understand the difference between quality and grade

1068
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:37.549
Orlando Sequera: we have. On one hand, we have a Honda civic.

1069
01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.130
Orlando Sequera: 2,020,

1070
01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:41.999
Orlando Sequera: and, on the other hand, we have a Ferrari.

1071
01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:44.489
Orlando Sequera: whichever model you like

1072
01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:49.080
Orlando Sequera: better. Probably it's a Ferrari 2,021

1073
01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.490
Orlando Sequera: or 2,022.

1074
01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.540
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1075
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:52.370
Orlando Sequera: So

1076
01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.810
Orlando Sequera: which one is higher quality.

1077
01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.890
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna open the chat for a second.

1078
01:57:01.090 --> 01:57:04.040
Orlando Sequera: based on what I said is based on the requirements

1079
01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:06.790
Orlando Sequera: which one has higher quality.

1080
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:13.319
Orlando Sequera: Well, the right answer. It depends.

1081
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.300
Orlando Sequera: It depends on the requirements. Exactly.

1082
01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.440
Orlando Sequera: Exactly. It depends on the requirements. The requirements are.

1083
01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.479
Orlando Sequera: I want a car. I'm the buyer, and I want a car that is

1084
01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:29.240
Orlando Sequera: that is

1085
01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:41.840
Orlando Sequera: build efficient as much as possible, and it's reliable as much as possible. They don't have to take it to the shop every week When a card that is reliable, and then like, and I want a car that is

1086
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:47.690
Orlando Sequera: fuel efficient which one has is those are the requirements which one has higher quality.

1087
01:57:50.590 --> 01:57:51.579
Orlando Sequera: Open the chat.

1088
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:55.290
Orlando Sequera: they home that civic correct.

1089
01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.630
Orlando Sequera: But when it comes to great

1090
01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:02.629
Orlando Sequera: i'm going to post the chat when it comes to great.

1091
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:04.440
Orlando Sequera: that's

1092
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:14.339
Orlando Sequera: different. That's when we're comparing both vehicles, apples to apples. When you compare the engine of the Honda civic to the engine of the Ferrari

1093
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:15.870
Orlando Sequera: apples to apples.

1094
01:58:16.330 --> 01:58:27.200
Orlando Sequera: would you compare the interior of the Honda Civic to the one of the Ferrari? Would you compare the exterior of the Honda Civic to the exterior of the Ferrari. So if

1095
01:58:27.250 --> 01:58:29.210
Orlando Sequera: if we're talking about rate.

1096
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:31.689
Orlando Sequera: what which one has hired rate

1097
01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.400
Orlando Sequera: the home, the saving, or the Ferrari.

1098
01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:39.749
Orlando Sequera: the Ferrari, but right by far hands down. So

1099
01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:41.240
Orlando Sequera: that is

1100
01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:44.190
Orlando Sequera: the simplest way to understand quality.

1101
01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:45.480
Orlando Sequera: So

1102
01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:49.820
Orlando Sequera: since I'm. Going to post the the chat, since we said

1103
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:50.670
Orlando Sequera: that

1104
01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.260
Orlando Sequera: quality is how well

1105
01:58:53.390 --> 01:59:01.180
Orlando Sequera: our product service of result meets the requirements or fulfill the requirements. Okay, we need to understand the requirements. They include

1106
01:59:01.690 --> 01:59:07.860
Orlando Sequera: compliance with standards. There might be some standards that we have to be compliant with. That's why we review our PA.

1107
01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:22.639
Orlando Sequera: It it's also about continuous improvement. There's always a better way of doing things that is continuous. We're gonna talk about that. And we need to, more importantly take into account our stakeholders expectations and our end user satisfaction.

1108
01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:25.589
Orlando Sequera: That's why the quality aspect is so important

1109
01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:29.489
Orlando Sequera: in our projects, and when it comes to quality

1110
01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:33.510
Orlando Sequera: there is going to be a cost associated with quality.

1111
01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:36.740
Orlando Sequera: and we can look at it from 2 perspectives

1112
01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.740
Orlando Sequera: is what we call cost of quality.

1113
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:42.389
Orlando Sequera: We can look at it from a

1114
01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.860
Orlando Sequera: proactive perspective.

1115
01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:51.039
Orlando Sequera: which is the money spent, and the time as well in avoiding failure.

1116
01:59:51.060 --> 02:00:00.990
Orlando Sequera: And that's what we call prevention costs. And this involves documentation, having the right equipment training our people to do it right, taking the time to do it right.

1117
02:00:01.410 --> 02:00:02.320
Orlando Sequera: It

1118
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:09.830
Orlando Sequera: document in the processes, and it's also about testing and inspections. Qa: You quality assurance

1119
02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:11.760
Orlando Sequera: that is

1120
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:18.399
Orlando Sequera: one type of cost of one aspect, one aspect of cost of quality.

1121
02:00:18.650 --> 02:00:21.580
Orlando Sequera: but he has another component, which is

1122
02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:33.039
Orlando Sequera: cost after the fact. After the failure came to fruition. There is, we we have in in their rework. When we have to fix defects. For example, a.

1123
02:00:33.210 --> 02:00:42.890
Orlando Sequera: We have scrap if we're working manufacturing, and then we also have warranties that need to be at the that need to be honored

1124
02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.809
Orlando Sequera: liabilities.

1125
02:00:44.850 --> 02:00:50.599
Orlando Sequera: and also damages to the brand of the organization lost business.

1126
02:00:50.650 --> 02:00:51.490
Orlando Sequera: So

1127
02:00:52.670 --> 02:00:57.440
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to cost of quality that the money Spain after

1128
02:00:57.550 --> 02:01:01.229
Orlando Sequera: during and after point, because of failure, is exponentially higher.

1129
02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:02.160
Orlando Sequera: then

1130
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:15.419
Orlando Sequera: the one that we should take into then the one from a proactive is exponentially higher compared to the proactive standpoint. So it's better to invest in being proactive.

1131
02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.210
Orlando Sequera: then having to spend the money later

1132
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:26.699
Orlando Sequera: in being reactive because it's going to be exponentially higher. But you combine the 2, and that's what we call cost of quality.

1133
02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:27.490
Okay.

1134
02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:30.009
Orlando Sequera: A: that's cost of quality.

1135
02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:32.220
Orlando Sequera: We also have

1136
02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:33.660
Orlando Sequera: to.

1137
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:39.049
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to quality, we have to take into account the expectations of our customers.

1138
02:01:39.130 --> 02:01:41.979
Orlando Sequera: We need to identify the quality requirements.

1139
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:52.910
Orlando Sequera: and that is, it will find a predictive approach that is important, and that's going to be part of our quality management plan. We need a specific plan that we're going to follow for our quality.

1140
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:54.320
Orlando Sequera: All right. So when

1141
02:01:54.380 --> 02:02:01.560
Orlando Sequera: a promise happened, we don't have to. We. We know what to do. That's why we create the plan. And also

1142
02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:21.769
Orlando Sequera: this is an ongoing process. It's about observation paying attention. It's about continuous improvement. It's always room for doing things in a more efficient way, but we have to follow the guidance of the quality policy. That's why, when we were talking about Opa, we the quality policy is an important aspect of it.

1143
02:02:22.090 --> 02:02:22.900
Okay.

1144
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:33.780
Orlando Sequera: And the quality management plan is the specific a guidelines that we're going to follow the rules of engagement that we're going to follow for quality, and then the quality policy is

1145
02:02:34.050 --> 02:02:38.589
Orlando Sequera: the guidelines specific to the organization. When it comes to quality.

1146
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:43.990
Orlando Sequera: the quality management plan is going to cover.

1147
02:02:44.130 --> 02:02:48.010
Orlando Sequera: All the activities are needed to achieve the quality objectives of the project.

1148
02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:54.409
Orlando Sequera: It can be formal or informal. It changes from organization to organization, and has to be reviewed

1149
02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:58.759
Orlando Sequera: thoroughly throughout the project. It can change, it can be modified.

1150
02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:02.290
Orlando Sequera: What is about the project value, proposition.

1151
02:03:02.770 --> 02:03:20.110
Orlando Sequera: identifying possible cost reduction for a project in the goal is to one of the benefits associated with it is to be able to mitigate schedule overruns from rework. Because we're dress. We invest in quality that's going to translate into less reward, less defects, less number of defects.

1152
02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:23.090
Orlando Sequera: A. After those deliverables are produced.

1153
02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:26.179
Orlando Sequera: We also have to take contract.

1154
02:03:26.730 --> 02:03:40.159
Orlando Sequera: Our compliance requirements. Compliance is super important. We're going to have. We have to pay attention to compliance requirements. It can be any regulation that is applicable to our industry and your organizational policies

1155
02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.080
Orlando Sequera: A.

1156
02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:56.959
Orlando Sequera: The implications when it comes to product and project quality requirements. And we have to classify these compliance requirements, understand the impacts of potential negative risks associated to compliance and have a response.

1157
02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.450
Orlando Sequera: And also

1158
02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:04.410
Orlando Sequera: And this is going to be information that is covered in your risk register. That is crucial.

1159
02:04:04.710 --> 02:04:05.410
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1160
02:04:06.850 --> 02:04:10.159
Orlando Sequera: there are multiple quality standards and regulations.

1161
02:04:10.290 --> 02:04:14.639
Orlando Sequera: A standard is a document that established by an actual authority.

1162
02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:28.080
Orlando Sequera: they. There is one that is very common widely known, which is the one that Vmi follows, which is the international organization for standardization, or Iso.

1163
02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:40.969
Orlando Sequera: or at least some of you are very familiar with that, and that's the one that mainly Pmi Pmi follows, and they're actually is applicable. They apply the 9,000 series for project management.

1164
02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.340
Orlando Sequera: It's aligned with the 9,000 series.

1165
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:48.110
Orlando Sequera: That's a standard. Then we also have regulations or lost that are applicable

1166
02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.119
Orlando Sequera: to our industry. We have to take those into account.

1167
02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:55.370
Orlando Sequera: We also have some what they call it the factor Standards there are

1168
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.309
Orlando Sequera: widely accepted.

1169
02:04:57.370 --> 02:05:17.269
Orlando Sequera: but it's not mandatory right. They They are best practices. But there you don't have to. Necessarily. It's not mandated that you have to follow them, but they are. Consider best practices, and then we have, what they call the dual regulations. A like, for example, a

1170
02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.459
Orlando Sequera: frequent path for schedule management is an example of that. That's

1171
02:05:23.170 --> 02:05:40.710
Orlando Sequera: It's approved by a body of experts. In this case. a group of person mansion pretty much for institute. Okay, it's not mandated by law to use the the curriculum path. Let me highlight that what is what is recognized by a body of experts is one of the best ways to manage your schedule.

1172
02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:42.939
Orlando Sequera: All right. We have to.

1173
02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:45.250
Orlando Sequera: We have to do that

1174
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:46.200
Orlando Sequera: A.

1175
02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:49.340
Orlando Sequera: Please make sure that you are aware of the fact

1176
02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:55.549
Orlando Sequera: which standards of regulations are applicable in your industry. That's why we review Opa's.

1177
02:05:55.570 --> 02:06:00.309
Orlando Sequera: Okay. That is the one of the answers Why, we have to review Opa's.

1178
02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:02.000
Okay.

1179
02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:06.549
Orlando Sequera: And then, when it comes to quality we have to be able to measure it.

1180
02:06:06.690 --> 02:06:13.059
Orlando Sequera: We have to be able to measure it. That's why we use metrics. We do that through testing, and we as multiple tools

1181
02:06:13.090 --> 02:06:17.860
Orlando Sequera: for that. And we also gonna have a threshold or quality tolerance.

1182
02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:22.149
Orlando Sequera: and we can include checklist templates and quality artifacts.

1183
02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:26.269
Orlando Sequera: and that's going to be contained in your quality management plan

1184
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:30.679
Orlando Sequera: for teams that are using the agent approach. They use

1185
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:40.379
Orlando Sequera: a specific ceremony or or meeting that is called the retrospective. This is where they go over. They They they have the opportunity to

1186
02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:47.159
Orlando Sequera: identify possible improvements. Lessons learned in the work that was done. But quality is applicable

1187
02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:50.349
Orlando Sequera: to both predictive and adaptive projects.

1188
02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:51.730
Orlando Sequera: Having said that

1189
02:06:52.170 --> 02:06:54.460
Orlando Sequera: going to go ahead and take a break.

1190
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:57.920
Orlando Sequera: We're ready for a second break. We'll be back in 10 min.

1191
02:06:57.980 --> 02:06:59.269
Orlando Sequera: Enjoy your break.

1192
02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.700
Orlando Sequera: All right, then we're back.

1193
02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.559
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue

1194
02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:24.939
Orlando Sequera: with our session. And

1195
02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:31.070
Orlando Sequera: so we were saying, we have to measure quality, and there are multiple ways that we can do that.

1196
02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:33.470
Orlando Sequera: And when it comes to quality

1197
02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:37.029
Orlando Sequera: we also have to take into account

1198
02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.330
Orlando Sequera: continuous improvement.

1199
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.689
Orlando Sequera: One of the there's always

1200
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:45.630
Orlando Sequera: a way to do things better.

1201
02:07:46.670 --> 02:07:50.460
Orlando Sequera: It's been evolving, and the in P. My uses

1202
02:07:50.610 --> 02:08:01.059
Orlando Sequera: There's several. There's a lot of work quality by itself. It's a major area that some of you. This is where 6 sigma, for example. That's quality.

1203
02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:17.390
Orlando Sequera: A about it's about the number of defects, keeping that to a very small number of defects that it's its own discipline by itself. They have certifications on that. The green bail, the yellow Bell, the Black Belt in in 6 sigmites. It's on discipline. Okay, but that is

1204
02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:28.130
Orlando Sequera: one method for continuous improvement. That's the goal. That Lin 6 Sigma has. Then you have t make, which is focusing on removing waste

1205
02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:31.469
Orlando Sequera: tison. That is about

1206
02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:43.340
Orlando Sequera: changing for the better continuous improvement. Actually, you also have the Pdc. A cycle plan. Do check act that Dr. Deming came up with

1207
02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:52.060
Orlando Sequera: a great books that have been written on the plan. Do check act cycle. That's one of the foundations of continuous improvement.

1208
02:08:52.230 --> 02:09:04.579
Orlando Sequera: and in agile you have from it that helps with continuous improvements all about that a Camden, and also another flavor of agile that is called crystal methods.

1209
02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:07.180
Orlando Sequera: so that is widely used they.

1210
02:09:07.230 --> 02:09:20.170
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the approach. There is going to be a quality method for continuous improvement, regardless of the approach on my that I mean, regardless of whether we go agile or we go traditional.

1211
02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.729
Orlando Sequera: All right. We are going to talk a little bit more about continuous improvement when we get to less than 5

1212
02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:37.140
Orlando Sequera: and if you wanna get ready for that, review it in advance, by all means. But we're gonna get a little bit deeper when it comes to

1213
02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:38.559
Orlando Sequera: a

1214
02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.119
Orlando Sequera: continuous improvement.

1215
02:09:41.850 --> 02:09:48.810
Orlando Sequera: and we talked about quality of products and deliverables, and we understand now the difference between quantity and great.

1216
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:51.309
Orlando Sequera: and the importance of quality, that

1217
02:09:51.360 --> 02:10:01.170
Orlando Sequera: cost of quality super super super important for your exam. To understand the cost of quality is the more customer facing which is

1218
02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:08.379
Orlando Sequera: A. When the products are in the hands of the customer they hire is going to be. So we want to invest in the cost of prevention

1219
02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:21.739
Orlando Sequera: a invest in training in taking the time to do things right in best invest in testing. So when the product services and results are in the hands of our customers, we are, it's

1220
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:28.770
Orlando Sequera: They're going to be the best shape possible. Okay, so that's it's that's a good. It's a good idea to be

1221
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:38.969
Orlando Sequera: proactive and not reactive when it comes to the cost of quantity. And we also talked a little bit about managing project compliance, the importance of managing those aspects.

1222
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:43.729
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to integration.

1223
02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:50.950
Orlando Sequera: This is where everything comes together. We have been talking about those multiple areas of our projects

1224
02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:52.400
Orlando Sequera: that are.

1225
02:10:53.130 --> 02:11:02.480
Orlando Sequera: and we're building multiple plans, communication management plan, stakeholder, engagement, plan, race management plans, COVID-19.

1226
02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:08.000
Orlando Sequera: Our cost management plan, schedule management plan, etc.

1227
02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:16.649
Orlando Sequera: They all need to come together. We need to be able to look at our project from an integrated perspective.

1228
02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:24.229
Orlando Sequera: The best analogy that I will use when it comes to explaining integration is, I want you to think of

1229
02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:31.409
Orlando Sequera: those multiple areas. I want you to think of an orchestra okay, an orchestra

1230
02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:34.510
Orlando Sequera: and those multiple areas

1231
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:38.450
Orlando Sequera: that you have in your project mind that I mean risk

1232
02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:40.769
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders, communication

1233
02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:41.840
Orlando Sequera: schedule

1234
02:11:41.890 --> 02:12:00.520
Orlando Sequera: cost, etc. Those multiple areas imagine them as the different types of instruments. By the way, i'm not an expert music. But imagine some. We have the the the percussion instruments, and we have the we have the different type of flutes and the different type of instruments that

1235
02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:09.899
Orlando Sequera: combined form the orchestra. But they all need to come together right. And then think of your project, members as the musicians.

1236
02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:19.319
Orlando Sequera: and I want you to think of you as the project manager as the orchestra conductor. Okay. The goal with

1237
02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:28.960
Orlando Sequera: your project management work in your project should be the goal that any orchestra has. Whenever they play a

1238
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:36.829
Orlando Sequera: Wh. Whenever they play, they they they play a piece or song, which is to produce a symphony

1239
02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.719
Orlando Sequera: in order to produce a symphony.

1240
02:12:39.970 --> 02:12:51.420
Orlando Sequera: Every single musician has to play their instrument at the right time, and coordination has to happen. Right. You see the orchestra conductor. They're not just moving their arms.

1241
02:12:51.430 --> 02:13:10.749
Orlando Sequera: They musicians know they are following. They're reading their their notes, and they know when they have to play, but they're paying attention to to the conductor, so they know when to play their instruments, and if everybody's coordinated, they produce the symphony. Otherwise it's going to be noise.

1242
02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:11.480
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1243
02:13:11.490 --> 02:13:35.399
Orlando Sequera: So in order for that to happen in the that is for an orchestra, right? So you are the orchestra conductor of your project. Your projecting members are the musicians, and then all the different types of instruments are going to be all these different areas that we have in our project. But they all need to come together, and we can achieve that through integration. This is super important.

1244
02:13:35.410 --> 02:13:37.849
Orlando Sequera: This is where all of it comes together.

1245
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:39.820
Orlando Sequera: and

1246
02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:58.940
Orlando Sequera: the goal, the actual outcome of this integration is going to be the overall project management plan. This is where all those subsidiary plans are going to come together. But you need to have one consolidated view of all those different plans they need because they have impacts, as as we said before.

1247
02:13:58.950 --> 02:14:00.139
Orlando Sequera: and

1248
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:20.249
Orlando Sequera: your scope, your scheduled, your a budget they are. They have implications with each other. Quality has implications with cost and schedule and scope, and they all interconnected. But we can manage them in in different silos. They all need to come together. That's what we do with integration.

1249
02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.429
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's what we do with integration.

1250
02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:25.379
Orlando Sequera: We have to integrate all those considered plans.

1251
02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:33.530
Orlando Sequera: And this is something that you may be wondering who has to do this. That's you, the project manager. You are

1252
02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:43.839
Orlando Sequera: responsible for integrating those plans. Okay, that is crucial, because that's how we have to manage our our project. Then, when it comes to

1253
02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:52.720
Orlando Sequera: and an agent approach, we have every iteration a structure in place that is going to help us to integrate

1254
02:14:52.810 --> 02:15:12.670
Orlando Sequera: multiple areas of the project. We have ceremonies for that that because we work in a different way. So we have. We're working in iterations. But we're going to have ceremonies that are going to help us to make adjustments and to integrate multiple areas of our project, and if we're following a hybrid approach, we have to reframe the fraud, have

1255
02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:20.439
Orlando Sequera: reframe the approach, have the flexibility and figure out a way to work with the different planning elements in

1256
02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:21.590
Orlando Sequera: as active

1257
02:15:21.710 --> 02:15:33.710
Orlando Sequera: while working. So you have to. You need to have that flexibility. Okay? So this happens in predictive in ha in agile. Or if we're following a hybrid approach

1258
02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:36.090
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1259
02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:39.559
Orlando Sequera: And

1260
02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:41.840
Orlando Sequera: this takes us to

1261
02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:44.819
Orlando Sequera: something that we keep mentioning.

1262
02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.720
Orlando Sequera: How do we

1263
02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:48.530
Orlando Sequera: address change

1264
02:15:49.070 --> 02:15:59.239
Orlando Sequera: in up with. If we're following a predictive approach, how how do we can we change those baseline, the score baseline, the query, baseline the budget.

1265
02:15:59.290 --> 02:16:08.899
Orlando Sequera: the the cost baseline, this Co. The scope based on Can they be changed? Can I change anything in my predictive project? The answer is, Yes, but it has to be controlled.

1266
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:10.000
Orlando Sequera: and

1267
02:16:10.190 --> 02:16:11.919
Orlando Sequera: this is how we do it with

1268
02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:22.340
Orlando Sequera: following integrated change control. So we need to have another plan that is called the Change management plan that is going to specify. We need to know who can propose a change?

1269
02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:24.420
Orlando Sequera: What is a change?

1270
02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:26.269
Orlando Sequera: What exactly is a change?

1271
02:16:26.490 --> 02:16:30.769
Orlando Sequera: What is the impact on the change of the change on project objectives.

1272
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:41.160
Orlando Sequera: What are the steps that we need to follow in order to evaluate a change request which, by the way is step number one. In using the change control process.

1273
02:16:41.379 --> 02:16:43.960
Orlando Sequera: who has the 40 to approve

1274
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:45.100
Orlando Sequera: changes

1275
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:51.899
Orlando Sequera: that has to be determined is usually a change Control Board, which is an entity formed by

1276
02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:54.680
Orlando Sequera: a upper management expert

1277
02:16:54.709 --> 02:17:10.850
Orlando Sequera: decision makers that can approve these changes, and they're going to evaluate the impact on what the impact on the cost, the impact on the schedule, the impact on the scope and they're going to make a determination. Usually project managers are not part of that change control Board

1278
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:16.299
Orlando Sequera: A. When the change request is approved. What happens when needs to happens afterwards?

1279
02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:36.240
Orlando Sequera: How is that change gonna be implemented? How can we make sure that the change was indeed implemented. So we use how can you confirm completion and quality? Then we have ways of doing that. So all that information is going to be in what we call a change management plan.

1280
02:17:38.889 --> 02:17:40.559
Orlando Sequera: If we're following.

1281
02:17:40.879 --> 02:17:44.769
Orlando Sequera: we need to have a plan for complexity and change.

1282
02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:46.100
Orlando Sequera: We have.

1283
02:17:46.209 --> 02:17:52.669
Orlando Sequera: and complexity within a come within a project is going to be the result of the organization system.

1284
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:56.690
Orlando Sequera: human behavior, and the level of uncertainty of ambiguity.

1285
02:17:57.209 --> 02:18:06.009
Orlando Sequera: The team has to create a way of working with that complexity, to navigate that complexity, and these are some sits

1286
02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:16.739
Orlando Sequera: and some best practices. So try to disconnect parts of the system to simplify it and have a better understanding, basically divide and conquer.

1287
02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:33.590
Orlando Sequera: You can use simulation to use similar unrelated scenarios to understand complexity. It reframe the problem, viewer, view the problem from different perspectives. And this is where, having a diverse team can help you because you can look at it from different perspectives

1288
02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:40.420
Orlando Sequera: or a balancing we're considering the type of data that is being used, or it can be processed based, can be

1289
02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:51.410
Orlando Sequera: through an iteration approach, plan iteratively or incrementally at features at a time, engage, or or having a failed safe, a plan for failure.

1290
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:57.429
Orlando Sequera: that, and mostly when we are a navigating this high level of complexity.

1291
02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:00.789
Orlando Sequera: The best bet is going to be to go with an agile approach.

1292
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:05.100
Orlando Sequera: and how this

1293
02:19:05.139 --> 02:19:06.309
Orlando Sequera: approach

1294
02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:11.910
Orlando Sequera: this fails fast and self correct. How does it work? Well.

1295
02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:20.200
Orlando Sequera: instead of planning, then, what we do is we focus on resiliency because we remember we're dealing with a lot of complexity

1296
02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:35.410
Orlando Sequera: we might not be able to plan. That's where following a measured approach. If we're navigating with a high level of complexity, that's why the recommendation is to go with an agile approach, not with a predictive approach, because we don't have enough information to plan. Okay, it's going to be.

1297
02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:41.169
Orlando Sequera: Chances are that it's going to be a waste of effort. So it's more about building, resiliency, adaptability

1298
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:54.500
Orlando Sequera: and tailoring, and having more importantly having a mindset that fosters collaboration with the teams, take home and stakeholders to achieve that level of adaptability and resilience.

1299
02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:58.880
Orlando Sequera: All right. What have we cover? So far?

1300
02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:01.440
Orlando Sequera: We cover integration

1301
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:09.350
Orlando Sequera: that is super important. This is where everything comes together. The main outcome here is the overall project management plan.

1302
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:14.340
Orlando Sequera: and we also talked about strategies for handling changes.

1303
02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:19.590
Orlando Sequera: and this takes us to the end of Lesson 3,

1304
02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:25.999
Orlando Sequera: and now we're going to move on to Lesson number 4. I like to take

1305
02:20:30.990 --> 02:20:35.200
Orlando Sequera: Take a couple of minutes to go over some questions in the

1306
02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:37.609
Orlando Sequera: chat, and we're going to

1307
02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:45.829
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. A. I'm. Sorry in the Q. A.

1308
02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:51.069
Orlando Sequera: It's a question. Can we talk about question to a slide 31. Well

1309
02:20:51.470 --> 02:20:55.699
Orlando Sequera: gotta be a little bit more specific because we're going to have stopping points. Okay.

1310
02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:58.190
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna have some stopping points. So

1311
02:20:58.410 --> 02:20:59.660
Orlando Sequera: a

1312
02:21:03.090 --> 02:21:08.880
Orlando Sequera: What he mentioned plan is by is created by the project manager working with the team members.

1313
02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:20.269
Orlando Sequera: It's risk finding the same in agile and predicted model projects, you should.

1314
02:21:20.310 --> 02:21:22.689
Orlando Sequera: for it's risk identification.

1315
02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:23.869
Orlando Sequera: and

1316
02:21:24.010 --> 02:21:27.889
Orlando Sequera: you have to perform risk notification regardless of the approach.

1317
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:39.590
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the Q. And a. Do you assign risk owners in adaptive as well, or just for predictive?

1318
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:44.670
Orlando Sequera: You can do it an adaptive as well. Yes.

1319
02:21:45.420 --> 02:22:00.490
Orlando Sequera: you know that that comes with who is lead for identifying a mitigating risks in self-forming team. The team members, the team members, and if they need help they have to communicate that for primarily the team members, but if they need some special depending on the risk.

1320
02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:04.080
Orlando Sequera: they need help from other team. They have to communicate that

1321
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.449
Orlando Sequera: that will be

1322
02:22:05.530 --> 02:22:17.150
Orlando Sequera: a a topic that will be brought up in the daily coordination meeting or the daily Stand up if if it's an impediment. Okay. So but primarily the team members under an adaptive approach

1323
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:33.160
Orlando Sequera: a risk corners internal, external. It depends on the risk, and you decide with the team and

1324
02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:34.580
Orlando Sequera: these stakeholders.

1325
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:40.140
Orlando Sequera: But whomever has the most knowledge it can be someone outside of the team. No, necessarily a team member.

1326
02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:41.000
Orlando Sequera: But

1327
02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:50.099
Orlando Sequera: you're working with stakeholders. This is probably a topic that is gonna be coming very often in a project status meeting. So you're gonna get the per the it's

1328
02:22:50.390 --> 02:22:56.619
Orlando Sequera: the we don't need to the most familiar with that type of risk that is going to be assigned with their response.

1329
02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:06.340
Orlando Sequera: Did you assign? Okay, do some risk owners in adaptive as well as just predictive. I just answer that.

1330
02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:26.730
Orlando Sequera: Are we performing this for each project? Yes, you should. The answer is, yes. Could there be a repository risk bill for the company, and we pull for that for a particular project. That will be a lesson learned. But your project is different. Your project is specific, so you should create

1331
02:23:26.740 --> 02:23:44.320
Orlando Sequera: at risk register for your own project. You should create an issue list for your own project. So you have to create this for every single project. Can you leverage lessons from the past? All the risk registers from past projects? Yes, but your specific project. You have to do it for the specific project.

1332
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:50.170
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1333
02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:59.180
Orlando Sequera: welcome to project management.

1334
02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:04.670
Orlando Sequera: okay.

1335
02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:14.299
Orlando Sequera: What is the best practice to consider the risk into the cost and completion calculation to rely on the people doing the work on your subject matter experts.

1336
02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:21.789
Orlando Sequera: our integration plans only for predictive approaches. No, you should.

1337
02:24:21.850 --> 02:24:24.000
Orlando Sequera: You can apply that to

1338
02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:29.119
Orlando Sequera: it. It doesn't hurt to implement it in.

1339
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:31.299
Orlando Sequera: You know that as well.

1340
02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:38.530
Orlando Sequera: Who is responsible for integrating quality plan in agile

1341
02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.199
Orlando Sequera: the team members

1342
02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:43.750
Orlando Sequera: mainly the scrum master.

1343
02:24:44.050 --> 02:24:46.699
Orlando Sequera: the semester working with the team members.

1344
02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:03.430
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1345
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:09.159
Orlando Sequera: all right. So i'm gonna continue. Then this is the end of Session 3.

1346
02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:10.460
Orlando Sequera: And

1347
02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:18.070
Orlando Sequera: now we're going to start talking about leading the project team. So this is mainly

1348
02:25:18.930 --> 02:25:22.709
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be covering topics related to the

1349
02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:27.510
Orlando Sequera: people domain important for the exam.

1350
02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:34.580
Orlando Sequera: And what we are going to be covering. This lesson for is going to be about craft. Your leadership skills

1351
02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:37.570
Orlando Sequera: create a collaborative project team environment.

1352
02:25:37.770 --> 02:25:48.999
Orlando Sequera: empowering the team, supporting team performance communication and collaboration with stakeholders. That is the second time that this is coming up. That should give an idea. It is important for the exam.

1353
02:25:49.170 --> 02:25:55.849
Orlando Sequera: and then also training, coaching, and mentoring, and last, but not least, about managing conflict.

1354
02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:00.430
Orlando Sequera: We're going to try to understand the guidelines for

1355
02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:07.469
Orlando Sequera: growing our resources, developing their competencies and skills, understanding the different leadership, styles.

1356
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:11.030
Orlando Sequera: artifacts, and strategies to be successful

1357
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:12.350
Orlando Sequera: in the

1358
02:26:12.450 --> 02:26:15.979
Orlando Sequera: A. In this in this specific topic

1359
02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.320
Orlando Sequera: the characteristics and core functions of teams that are empowered

1360
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:26.470
Orlando Sequera: the forms of communication and collaboration in ideal in a project team environment.

1361
02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:29.270
Orlando Sequera: understand the importance of value

1362
02:26:29.470 --> 02:26:35.670
Orlando Sequera: and value of training and coaching and mentoring a team. So 3 different things, by the way.

1363
02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:48.859
Orlando Sequera: and also super important. I'm gonna highlight that for the Pmp. Exam. Conflict management super important for the exam config is gonna happen. We're gonna talk about it, and we're gonna go over some

1364
02:26:48.870 --> 02:27:00.690
Orlando Sequera: a techniques to for conflict resolution. But you should expect questions on your Pmp. Exam related to conflict management and also look at the levels of conflict and their outcomes

1365
02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:25.769
Orlando Sequera: teams, as we know, for anyone that has worked in Project manager and you have individuals that have different skill sets different levels of experience, different attitudes. They're from different countries in some cases different cultures, right? But the goal to be successful with any project is to have a team

1366
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:31.310
Orlando Sequera: that is productive and effective, and, as we have learned

1367
02:27:31.690 --> 02:27:42.660
Orlando Sequera: in May in most cases as the project manager. We're not going to have the level of authority, so we have to use something else. We have to use leadership. This is needed.

1368
02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:51.370
Orlando Sequera: This is a trade that is required on everyone on the project team, especially the project manager. This is super super, super, important

1369
02:27:52.390 --> 02:27:53.270
Orlando Sequera: for

1370
02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:54.369
Orlando Sequera: skills

1371
02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:56.709
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1372
02:27:57.610 --> 02:28:08.969
Orlando Sequera: being able to work with others, communicate and having empathy and being able to relate to others, come into play. This is super super super important.

1373
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.760
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1374
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:13.539
Orlando Sequera: how can we develop

1375
02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:16.729
Orlando Sequera: inclusive leadership competencies.

1376
02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:21.869
Orlando Sequera: You should tailor your leadership style to the situation

1377
02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:32.240
Orlando Sequera: a ideally. You should live with empathy, so pay attention to what happens to others. It's not just about you. It's about the team. You got to put the team first.

1378
02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:48.110
Orlando Sequera: understand what motivates the team members in their working styles and understand that this changes. I'm going to give you a real life example in the Artemis program. I was in a very particular situation in which

1379
02:28:48.390 --> 02:28:53.639
Orlando Sequera: I worked in project team with project teams that they

1380
02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:56.509
Orlando Sequera: that were form by

1381
02:28:56.810 --> 02:28:58.410
Orlando Sequera: people from

1382
02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:03.249
Orlando Sequera: A for from different a generations.

1383
02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:07.439
Orlando Sequera: And by that I mean, we have on one hand

1384
02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:14.890
Orlando Sequera: some engineers that work in the shuttle program, and, as you know, the shutter program lasts to 30 years.

1385
02:29:14.970 --> 02:29:31.130
Orlando Sequera: and it ended in 2,011, and we still have some a professional that worked in. Some of them actually work for the entire a 30 years in in the shuttle program. And now they're working in the Artemis program that has been gonna for a little bit

1386
02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:33.619
Orlando Sequera: more than 10 years. So

1387
02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:35.360
Orlando Sequera: those are baby boomers

1388
02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:38.640
Orlando Sequera: in their getting close.

1389
02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:41.849
Orlando Sequera: if not already a close to we terminate.

1390
02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:44.419
Orlando Sequera: But, on the other hand, we have

1391
02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:49.219
Orlando Sequera: a few millennials, but we have a lot of Gen. Z.

1392
02:29:49.410 --> 02:29:50.459
Orlando Sequera: We have

1393
02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:51.570
Orlando Sequera: fresh

1394
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:56.620
Orlando Sequera: dream brand new engineers that just came out rather college as a super bright.

1395
02:29:57.040 --> 02:30:07.310
Orlando Sequera: and they're working in this in these projects. So we have baby boomers on one side, and we also have Gen. Zs a few millennials, and then

1396
02:30:07.970 --> 02:30:11.410
Orlando Sequera: a few of us. I'm a Jim i'm a Gen. Xer.

1397
02:30:12.010 --> 02:30:14.310
Orlando Sequera: and there are right in the middle.

1398
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:33.410
Orlando Sequera: and this the motivation for a baby boomer is totally different compared to the one of agenda, and the working style is totally different. So it re as the project manager. You have to understand that and take take the time to really navigate through that, so you can be effect

1399
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:37.649
Orlando Sequera: in order to that. Well, old machine that is the project team

1400
02:30:37.730 --> 02:30:45.670
Orlando Sequera: and another guideline that can help you to be successful is about transparency and openness to build. Trust with your team. That's crucial.

1401
02:30:45.690 --> 02:30:53.110
Orlando Sequera: The team has to trust you. Get. They have to get to the point that they know that you have their back, and vice versa.

1402
02:30:53.370 --> 02:31:04.459
Orlando Sequera: and for those of you that come from the military. Do you know this better than me? Same principle here, right same principle here it's it's about teamwork. It's about. We we have to

1403
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:10.150
Orlando Sequera: it's a it's all of us. It's all of us, not just me. It's all of us all right.

1404
02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:14.109
Orlando Sequera: and then make sure that external resources are also included.

1405
02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:17.500
Orlando Sequera: Not just the team. It's also about the stakeholders

1406
02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:21.479
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1407
02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:29.340
Orlando Sequera: the skills that you need to in order to work well with your team and also your stakeholders is about communication.

1408
02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:41.549
Orlando Sequera: and that's something that you're gonna be doing as a project manager for a most of the time. According to some some experts, 90% of your time as a project manager is going to be spend in communicating in one

1409
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:43.430
Orlando Sequera: way or another.

1410
02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:45.820
Orlando Sequera: Okay, it's important that we can communicate

1411
02:31:46.270 --> 02:32:00.050
Orlando Sequera: conflict management, super super super important critical thinking, not only for leadership, but also for the Pmp. Exam: so a problem solving cultural awareness, decision making key aspect of project management.

1412
02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:01.380
Orlando Sequera: Also

1413
02:32:02.530 --> 02:32:04.899
Orlando Sequera: the emotional intelligence technique

1414
02:32:05.350 --> 02:32:25.010
Orlando Sequera: that is, emotional intelligence that is super important. It's not just about a IQ. It's also about Eq. Or Emotional intelligence following an ethical approach. That's also part of the Pmp mindset that I that I mentioned briefly before expertise. As for judgment, facilitation

1415
02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:36.779
Orlando Sequera: as the Pm. You're going to be doing that in more in in multiple ways, meeting management, super important negotiation with your team members with stakeholders that is crucial.

1416
02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:39.200
Orlando Sequera: Think of you as a diplomat as well.

1417
02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:49.249
Orlando Sequera: Networking net, working with home with your team members, with your stakeholders. That's crucial. That's key. I'm: Probably one of the most important ones is about team building.

1418
02:32:49.690 --> 02:32:50.380
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1419
02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:00.570
Orlando Sequera: All right

1420
02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:06.450
Orlando Sequera: in the personal team skills, active listening

1421
02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:13.039
Orlando Sequera: and communication Styles assessment we mentioned before. That is important. With active listening.

1422
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:29.889
Orlando Sequera: Make sure what you're trying you trying to make sure that you're understanding, and and you're acknowledged, and understanding what you pay attention to what you're a to the message that you're receiving from with the people that you're communicated with your center intended. So the message is coming across.

1423
02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:36.090
Orlando Sequera: and remember that we need to understand the communication styles a that are

1424
02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:41.260
Orlando Sequera: going to be work with each individual. So we need to perform that a

1425
02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:48.699
Orlando Sequera: that awareness, then emotional intelligence, not letting your actions dictate your emotions dictate your actions

1426
02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:53.870
Orlando Sequera: in a two-way street influencing motivation nominal group technique.

1427
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:56.739
Orlando Sequera: political awareness and transparency.

1428
02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:02.820
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to leadership styles. As we said, we have to tailor that.

1429
02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:05.619
Orlando Sequera: But there are multiple leadership styles.

1430
02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:08.199
Orlando Sequera: There's one that is direct.

1431
02:34:08.250 --> 02:34:12.879
Orlando Sequera: This is hierarchical when you ask the Pm. Or making all the decisions

1432
02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:21.250
Orlando Sequera: consultative when a leader factors in opinions, but is the one that is making decisions serve, and leadership

1433
02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:35.249
Orlando Sequera: super important for the Pmp. Exam. You model the desire behaviors. And again, my recommendation for the Pmp. Exam Look at every single question, for from the perspective of a server leader

1434
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:38.080
Orlando Sequera: you also have consensus. Collaborative

1435
02:34:38.730 --> 02:34:43.029
Orlando Sequera: teams gonna operate autonomously, and situational style changes

1436
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:46.010
Orlando Sequera: to fit context and material experience of the team

1437
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:51.539
Orlando Sequera: differences between leadership and management. They're not the same.

1438
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:59.949
Orlando Sequera: Leadership is about guiding the team with by using discussion, getting buy in from the team

1439
02:34:59.970 --> 02:35:04.490
Orlando Sequera: as an exchange of idea. We motive, we do that for motivation.

1440
02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:11.880
Orlando Sequera: but management is about authority. It's about direct connections, using a prescribe center of behaviors.

1441
02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:31.239
Orlando Sequera: They are not the same, however. They are not mutually exclusive. Most great managers are also great leaders. Okay, so they're not the same, but they are not also mutually exclusive. You can be a great manager. Usually great managers are also great great leaders.

1442
02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:32.530
Orlando Sequera: The goal here

1443
02:35:32.610 --> 02:35:40.379
Orlando Sequera: is to adapt your leadership styles to situations and your stakeholders, and that goes back to the organizational culture as well

1444
02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:45.350
Orlando Sequera: be aware of individual and team aims are working relationships within the team

1445
02:35:45.890 --> 02:35:48.240
Orlando Sequera: and use political awareness

1446
02:35:48.350 --> 02:35:49.300
Orlando Sequera: and

1447
02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:54.819
Orlando Sequera: emotional intelligence. Don't, let those emotions dictate. Your actions

1448
02:35:55.570 --> 02:35:56.830
Orlando Sequera: serve and leadership

1449
02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:11.270
Orlando Sequera: interesting. That, a couple of nights ago I was able to have a after the class. I went to dinner with a relative that serve in the military, like most of you. And this topic came up.

1450
02:36:11.610 --> 02:36:14.440
Orlando Sequera: I have a certain leadership, and

1451
02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:17.069
Orlando Sequera: he basically clarified to me

1452
02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:19.050
Orlando Sequera: and said that

1453
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:21.149
Orlando Sequera: those of you first of all fit.

1454
02:36:21.450 --> 02:36:27.570
Orlando Sequera: Please thank them for for for their service. And by all means. Yeah, thank you very much for your service.

1455
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:39.169
Orlando Sequera: And he said, If there's anybody that knows about servant leadership, most likely are those guys in your class that are transitioning from the military. They leave them brief, serve and leadership.

1456
02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:48.990
Orlando Sequera: and he ventured to say that they understand server leadership probably better than a lot of people in the in the civilian world that are in leadership positions.

1457
02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:52.340
Orlando Sequera: It's about putting people first to put in

1458
02:36:52.370 --> 02:37:01.019
Orlando Sequera: teams first putting people first. They leave and breathe that in most cases on a daily basis. So that's exactly what it is

1459
02:37:01.230 --> 02:37:04.039
Orlando Sequera: putting the team and the people first.

1460
02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:05.100
Orlando Sequera: That's

1461
02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:07.200
Orlando Sequera: That's what social leadership in there

1462
02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:12.169
Orlando Sequera: in in a nutshell is so for those of you that are transitioning.

1463
02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:32.120
Orlando Sequera: This is a this is some. This is the actual a paradigm that you have to follow when working with your team with your project teams, You' about server leadership. Put in the team first. It's about facilitating, removing impediments, helping them to be successful and encourage

1464
02:37:32.130 --> 02:37:45.950
Orlando Sequera: everything. Member and you're the role model of those desired behaviors and encourage them to also be a sermon, leaders. This is the approach and again super important for the Pmp. Exam. Look at the Pmp. Exam questions

1465
02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:58.050
Orlando Sequera: from the perspective of a servant leader. We're not directing. We're not telling them what to do. We are serving them, we're helping them to be successful. We're putting them, putting our people first. Okay.

1466
02:37:59.910 --> 02:38:04.129
Orlando Sequera: and another important aspect is adopting a growth mindset.

1467
02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:06.760
Orlando Sequera: We shouldn't let

1468
02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:15.700
Orlando Sequera: past experience and processes give you. They can provide guidance what they shouldn't Dictate your actions here.

1469
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:18.540
Orlando Sequera: I also have an example from

1470
02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:27.270
Orlando Sequera: my situation with, working with baby Boomers and me and Genesis in the Artemis program

1471
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:39.410
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of the army's program. We had a lot, especially a lot of the the the older engineers that worked in the shorter program trying. They were always saying, Well, during shuttle days. We did it this way

1472
02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:41.420
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of the program

1473
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:45.890
Orlando Sequera: that was valid. We didn't have anything else to compare with. But over time

1474
02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:51.690
Orlando Sequera: that started to change, and I could see some animosity from special

1475
02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:56.350
Orlando Sequera: your engineers to say, Well, that was a shuttle. But this is a spacecraft. It's a different

1476
02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:07.259
Orlando Sequera: this many differences, some things are the same, but not everything is going to be the same. So we should have and adopt. And that was part of my job to start trying to

1477
02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:09.640
Orlando Sequera: change the paradigm and adopt

1478
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:29.350
Orlando Sequera: a growth mindset. Okay, we can learn from the short program days, but that shouldn't dictate our actions. If this is a different type of spacecraft, we it's about. Let's look for better ideas, not because that's what worked in the past that should dictate the future. Okay, we can take lessons learned, but we have

1479
02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:43.100
Orlando Sequera: to look for continuous improvement, find for better ideas and new new perspectives, and that's how that was the approach in that specific aspect, and that worked really well. It wasn't that easy. But it worked really well.

1480
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:45.919
Orlando Sequera: Team building super important.

1481
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:51.670
Orlando Sequera: Do you have to work in. Try to build a cohesive unit

1482
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:53.509
Orlando Sequera: that ha! Teams that

1483
02:39:53.820 --> 02:40:02.220
Orlando Sequera: i'm not saying that they have to be best friends. That's not what i'm saying, but they need to be able to work with each other. Well, okay, Good leadership

1484
02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:19.709
Orlando Sequera: facilitates this funding and try to work on team building activities. They can be formal, they can be formal. I used to bring a box of donuts and some power bars to people that didn't like to on Fridays, for example, or every once a month I had. If I had the budget. I will take my teams out to lunch.

1485
02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:23.339
Orlando Sequera: Figure it out. Get help from Hr.

1486
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:29.530
Orlando Sequera: If you, if you don't have any ideas, or within the the constraints of your organization.

1487
02:40:29.770 --> 02:40:35.280
Orlando Sequera: try to work on team building. Okay, you can facilitate it, or you can have

1488
02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:37.199
Orlando Sequera: professional facilitators.

1489
02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:40.159
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to.

1490
02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:41.590
Orlando Sequera: They

1491
02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:47.280
Orlando Sequera: document stages of team development. Second time that this is coming up. We watch a video

1492
02:40:47.810 --> 02:40:49.340
Orlando Sequera: on day 2 for now.

1493
02:40:50.050 --> 02:40:52.870
Orlando Sequera: But this is important. Okay.

1494
02:40:53.330 --> 02:41:03.759
Orlando Sequera: Every single team goes through the tugman ladder of team. The the talkman stages top my ladder of team development that happens to every single team. Okay.

1495
02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:05.880
Orlando Sequera: And by the way.

1496
02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:07.930
Orlando Sequera: this is.

1497
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:28.549
Orlando Sequera: there is a type of question that is called match making in the Pmp. Exam, in which, on one hand, you can have a column with the different stages; and, on the other hand, you might have the definition, and the question might be to match the 2 columns. That might be one type of question that you might face in your Pmp. Exam.

1498
02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:30.039
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

1499
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:40.140
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you get familiarized with the talkman stages of team development. The first one is forming. This is when the team gets together for the first time

1500
02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:41.330
Orlando Sequera: they

1501
02:41:42.330 --> 02:41:45.729
Orlando Sequera: they don't know each other. They are just

1502
02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:46.680
Orlando Sequera: a

1503
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:50.320
Orlando Sequera: usually very the very quiet. They

1504
02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:54.540
Orlando Sequera: They just needed each other, and everybody is trying to understand what

1505
02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:57.730
Orlando Sequera: what's going on with the rest of the team members

1506
02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:58.890
Orlando Sequera: them.

1507
02:41:59.060 --> 02:42:01.709
Orlando Sequera: The next stage is forming

1508
02:42:02.350 --> 02:42:04.610
Orlando Sequera: this. I'm sorry storming.

1509
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:08.430
Orlando Sequera: This is where the team members try to

1510
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:13.419
Orlando Sequera: impose their ways. Well, in my previous project we did it this way.

1511
02:42:13.570 --> 02:42:15.340
Orlando Sequera: and it worked.

1512
02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:32.699
Orlando Sequera: But you might have another team member that says Well, but in my previous project. We did it that way, and that's what worked, and you start having clash. The probabilities of having conflict here increase. So this requires a lot of oversight from you at the Pm.

1513
02:42:32.890 --> 02:42:46.699
Orlando Sequera: To make sure that they get out of this space of storming as quickly as possible. Okay. But it's going to happen it's going to try to take control. Remember that usually team members are highly intelligent people.

1514
02:42:46.810 --> 02:42:54.539
Orlando Sequera: very a smart, and their experts are their craft in most cases. So they fry. There's a control struggle

1515
02:42:54.550 --> 02:43:07.470
Orlando Sequera: A. And that's just just human nature. They go through that. So your goal is to help the team to navigate the storm in face, so they can get out of it as quickly as possible, because then, after the storm there comes to come.

1516
02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:11.170
Orlando Sequera: and that will be the Norman State. This is where the team starts.

1517
02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:23.579
Orlando Sequera: Okay, understand a little bit more about the different working styles, and to start to accept a little more start to work together a little bit better. The level of trust increases

1518
02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:33.380
Orlando Sequera: and things start. They. The level of productivity also increases, because in formula storming is very low. This is when the level of productivity starts to increase.

1519
02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:41.260
Orlando Sequera: Then you get to performing. That is the ideal stage, because teams have reached the level of performing.

1520
02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:44.330
Orlando Sequera: They are a whale, all machine

1521
02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:45.680
Orlando Sequera: that this is.

1522
02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:55.950
Orlando Sequera: This is the the the Nirvana for any project manager, because this is where you see people that are it. They can pretty much complete their sentences. They're aligned

1523
02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:10.209
Orlando Sequera: any. If there's a challenge that comes up, they they're proactively going to tackle it, and they communicate well with each other, and they they resolve any conflicts on their own if they come to fruition. And you just.

1524
02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:26.480
Orlando Sequera: you have to be a a super server leader. When it comes to the State, just cater to them, let them drive it to success. That is the best. if it's the best feeling that support manager to be able to get to the performance stage. But, as we know, projects come to an end.

1525
02:44:26.850 --> 02:44:27.850
Orlando Sequera: and

1526
02:44:28.050 --> 02:44:30.860
Orlando Sequera: and then team members that complete their activities.

1527
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:47.269
Orlando Sequera: They are going to be adjourned, and that's what happens in a journey. They, when they complete their work, they move to the next project, and that happens. So that's why we have the 5 stages. Make sure that you know this for the exam, and make sure that

1528
02:44:47.680 --> 02:45:00.440
Orlando Sequera: You're familiar with this, you might be wondering what happens if we have an and this could also very well be a a a type of question in your exam what happens in

1529
02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:10.560
Orlando Sequera: the event of a new team member. You are in the performing stage. But then there is a change in the team and a new team memory is added to the team will.

1530
02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:27.360
Orlando Sequera: Unfortunately, what happens is that this is going to reset You're going to go back to forming. If you make changes to the team. It goes back to forming, so it's your job to make sure that you get out of that forming and storming faces as quickly as possible.

1531
02:45:27.370 --> 02:45:36.339
Orlando Sequera: Put any changes to the team that's gonna drive it's gonna reset the clock, and you're gonna go back to forming. Okay, that's what happens

1532
02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:39.209
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more about

1533
02:45:40.170 --> 02:45:47.240
Orlando Sequera: balance the team tone with sense of urgency. We're leading, but of course we have to drive

1534
02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:51.339
Orlando Sequera: our team to completion to complete the tasks. So

1535
02:45:51.790 --> 02:46:08.859
Orlando Sequera: always in a positive environment, with a positive connotation, you as fluid communication and promote positive interactions as much as possible, but emphasize the sense of urgency that is important. And how do we do that with the vision and values, making sure that people are committed

1536
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:13.389
Orlando Sequera: because we great power comes great responsibility and try to

1537
02:46:14.110 --> 02:46:25.219
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that people understand the importance of the work that is being done. You have to convey that message. So this has to be a balance with the tone and the sense of urgency

1538
02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:27.580
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1539
02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:37.960
Orlando Sequera: the virtual teams is a little bit more challenging. It's not that simple You're going to have. It requires a little bit more oversight to keep them engaged, but

1540
02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:46.740
Orlando Sequera: we're contain dynamics. Be on top of them. Make sure that you a address them. Their needs that they don't feel isolated.

1541
02:46:46.820 --> 02:46:52.350
Orlando Sequera: use effective communication. There are multiple tools that you can use nowadays for participants.

1542
02:46:52.430 --> 02:47:07.469
Orlando Sequera: and even If you're using a video conferencing tool, try to have the camera on, so you can measure body, language and the tone and the expressions that might help you to understand how they're feeling, so it requires

1543
02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:12.979
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more oversight, but it is possible, and then use the tools that are available

1544
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:18.490
Orlando Sequera: like Cameron style boards. If you're using an agent approach so they can. So

1545
02:47:18.820 --> 02:47:20.009
Orlando Sequera: they were a.

1546
02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:25.400
Orlando Sequera: Because visible. The work status is visible, and they can ask for help if they need to.

1547
02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:29.909
Orlando Sequera: some of the best practices with virtual teams.

1548
02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:36.780
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that with your oversight with your constant communication, you address that possible risk of

1549
02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:38.940
Orlando Sequera: team members feeling isolated.

1550
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:52.390
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you reinforce the message that is about the team. So for those of you in the military, you know this way better than me. It's about the team goals. It's not about individual accomplishment is

1551
02:47:52.400 --> 02:48:12.499
Orlando Sequera: the in, and that's how stakeholders Look at you. It's about the team. They don't look at the individual. They look at the project team. So focus on shared commitments, and if they're not doing that work, make sure that you understand that that's gonna have an impact on all their team members. So it's about a share commitment and make sure that you drive that message home.

1552
02:48:13.430 --> 02:48:14.330
Orlando Sequera: And

1553
02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:17.150
Orlando Sequera: this is what we have covered so far.

1554
02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:20.699
Orlando Sequera: So we started covering the first topics about leading the team.

1555
02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:22.939
Orlando Sequera: We talked about several liter

1556
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:34.190
Orlando Sequera: super important for the exam. Again. Look at the questions from the perspective of a servant leader. Determine which is the Taylor, the leadership style that you're going to follow.

1557
02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:38.550
Orlando Sequera: And also look at the different options that you have to lead

1558
02:48:38.650 --> 02:48:51.879
Orlando Sequera: team members and stakeholders. Okay, lead not man, actually. And also make sure that you, if you're working a virtual setting, then that you have a way to support your virtual, a teams as well.

1559
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:54.949
Orlando Sequera: And that takes us to

1560
02:48:55.940 --> 02:49:03.170
Orlando Sequera: creating a collaborative project team environment. Okay. So we're gonna look at best practices

1561
02:49:03.230 --> 02:49:06.169
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that the work can happen

1562
02:49:06.830 --> 02:49:24.650
Orlando Sequera: smoothly. Okay, we're gonna go over some how to create a structure for physical and which are working. That's what we mean by environment, including workspace management, project, artifact document, creation and configuration management. Some things that some of you have mentioned before. But that's part of project management.

1563
02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:29.950
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to environment, we need to find where

1564
02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:32.480
Orlando Sequera: and how the team is gonna work

1565
02:49:33.290 --> 02:49:39.060
Orlando Sequera: co-location. And by that I mean having everyone on the same in the same physical space

1566
02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:48.870
Orlando Sequera: and within 6 feet of each other that is, if at all possible. That is the best way. But it's not always possible. Okay? And why is it

1567
02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:59.130
Orlando Sequera: option? Because that helps with communication that helps with interaction. Information flows freely in the

1568
02:49:59.630 --> 02:50:05.619
Orlando Sequera: it helps in many aspects, but it's not always possible. So you have to take into account the environment and location

1569
02:50:05.850 --> 02:50:20.269
Orlando Sequera: 14 performance, and always always always foster. This is one of your main responsibilities. As as the project manager foster that meaningful interaction to support teams autonomy, and

1570
02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:36.560
Orlando Sequera: going back to something that we worked on. We created those we wrote that team charter with the ground Rules respect those agreements, respect the agreed team. Working hours and practices go back to the ground rules that were created by the team

1571
02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:40.370
Orlando Sequera: a following collaborative approach.

1572
02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:45.990
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to agile space for hybrid teams.

1573
02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:52.089
Orlando Sequera: you should also take this into account. And the environment is also applicable, regardless of the approach.

1574
02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:56.229
Orlando Sequera: Create a team space that helps with

1575
02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:01.780
Orlando Sequera: but just co-location if at all possible, but at least collaboration.

1576
02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:05.580
Orlando Sequera: communication, transparency, and visibility

1577
02:51:05.930 --> 02:51:13.710
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to transparency what we're really saying, and and this is super important. This is one of the pillars of

1578
02:51:13.740 --> 02:51:23.080
Orlando Sequera: the empirical process is about transparency, inspection, and adaptability, and is also about visibility. And this is where tools, like

1579
02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:30.370
Orlando Sequera: Jira, for example, when you can create a dashboard for your project, and people can see the status of the work.

1580
02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:47.799
Orlando Sequera: Give everyone the access that they need to, so they can understand what's going on with our project. So we're talking about agile projects. Right? So that's why we create it could be a Camden board or some sort of type of information that shows the status of the work, and

1581
02:51:47.980 --> 02:51:52.480
Orlando Sequera: in that information radiator is multiple columns. We have the list of

1582
02:51:53.100 --> 02:52:12.280
Orlando Sequera: features or Use of stories that are in the to-do list. This is these are the features that are in the to do list. These are the features that are being worked on right now in the iteration. These are the user stories or features that are being tested. These are the user stories or features that are blocked.

1583
02:52:12.680 --> 02:52:15.540
Orlando Sequera: and these are the user. Stories or features that are

1584
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:16.500
Orlando Sequera: Don.

1585
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:17.900
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So that is

1586
02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:24.159
Orlando Sequera: how we can be transparent using those tools if we're following an agile approach.

1587
02:52:24.870 --> 02:52:34.169
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect that I have mentioned before is to take into account that we have tools that can help us to

1588
02:52:34.230 --> 02:52:47.130
Orlando Sequera: a share this information and and manage our projects. So Pms. That stands for project management information system. The best example is Microsoft Project

1589
02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:50.490
Orlando Sequera: to be a very popular tool for project management.

1590
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:51.390
Orlando Sequera: and

1591
02:52:51.890 --> 02:53:03.780
Orlando Sequera: this is where we can build our schedule, our budget, a assign our resources, calculate the quicker path. They can help us with all of that, and we can integrate all the project data

1592
02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:05.999
Orlando Sequera: mainly use for

1593
02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:11.559
Orlando Sequera: predicted projects. I would say Microsoft Mexico Project.

1594
02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:16.219
Orlando Sequera: But we also have other tools like Jira, a trello.

1595
02:53:16.390 --> 02:53:18.450
Orlando Sequera: a version, one

1596
02:53:18.470 --> 02:53:25.809
Orlando Sequera: team foundation server or Microsoft that can help you better if you're following an agile approach. But you have

1597
02:53:26.370 --> 02:53:29.330
Orlando Sequera: multiple tools that can help you, regardless of the approach.

1598
02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:30.839
Orlando Sequera: and you also have.

1599
02:53:31.530 --> 02:53:50.330
Orlando Sequera: in order to manage all and store and manage and control all those documents and artifacts that we are creating. We also have artifacts, management systems in place. The best example is Microsoft sharepoint or team or teams that actually is integrated with sharepoint or other options like Google drive.

1600
02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:53.090
Orlando Sequera: so we can have repositories for documents.

1601
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.900
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1602
02:53:54.470 --> 02:53:58.639
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the importance of artifacts.

1603
02:53:59.230 --> 02:54:10.160
Orlando Sequera: artifacts are going to enable it to enable us to reconstruct the history of the project, these documents that we are creating for us to manage our project, and

1604
02:54:10.180 --> 02:54:15.489
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be able to create multiple artifacts at Wbs: the Rbs.

1605
02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:29.920
Orlando Sequera: And a lot of documentation. Brace registers take all the register. They project charter, multiple, but they are important, and they're gonna need a They're gonna we need them in order to manage our projects. Okay.

1606
02:54:35.550 --> 02:54:39.479
Orlando Sequera: all right. And when it comes to information storage

1607
02:54:39.570 --> 02:54:52.119
Orlando Sequera: some of the guidance that are for recommendations, select an accessible location within the constraints that your organization has right. If your organization uses Microsoft teams, for example, a integrated with sharepoint

1608
02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:53.119
Orlando Sequera: use that

1609
02:54:53.260 --> 02:55:09.650
Orlando Sequera: you don't have to go and ask for. Well, we should use Google drive because I like Google better. No. You use what is available within the organization. Select an accessible location. If you're following an agile approach, as I mentioned, use an information radiator.

1610
02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:22.300
Orlando Sequera: That is a graphic representation of the status of the work. So anyone that would like to understand the status of your project, can look at the information radiator and understand what the status of the the project is.

1611
02:55:22.450 --> 02:55:33.350
Orlando Sequera: A. Again, the storage and distribution system should match the complexity of your project. There's some very high tech and very involved in

1612
02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:37.479
Orlando Sequera: production distribution solutions out there, and

1613
02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:43.350
Orlando Sequera: if you're working with teams that are in different your graphical locations.

1614
02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:50.679
Orlando Sequera: one recommendation is to use cloud-based systems for larger projects, which is becoming more and more prevalent nowadays.

1615
02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:56.390
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to

1616
02:55:56.810 --> 02:55:58.260
Orlando Sequera: the artifacts.

1617
02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:02.590
Orlando Sequera: we should be efficient in the way we create them

1618
02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:06.230
Orlando Sequera: we should use. That's why it's so important to rely

1619
02:56:06.460 --> 02:56:26.230
Orlando Sequera: on the Pmo. So we follow standardized formats and templates. So we don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time, and by that I mean in every single project are going to. I'm going to recreate from Scratch. How am I going to create how to create the Risk Register? No. This should be a standard. You shouldn't have to waste any time

1620
02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:30.630
Orlando Sequera: on figuring out how to create the risk Register should be available.

1621
02:56:30.970 --> 02:56:31.650
Orlando Sequera: If

1622
02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:48.329
Orlando Sequera: if the organization is new to project management practices. Yes, by all means you're gonna have to work from scratch in that situation. But if your organization has templates in place, use them, and that's gonna help with the structure process for review and approval of those documents follow that

1623
02:56:48.770 --> 02:56:54.209
Orlando Sequera: standardized approach. And, more importantly, it's also going to help you with version control, because.

1624
02:56:54.400 --> 02:57:13.480
Orlando Sequera: with the exception of the project charter, these documents and artifacts are living documents, meaning that they're going to be changing throughout the project, and also security aspect, because not everybody needs to have access to every single document. Some of them, like the financials of the project, are. Do you need to control the access for that. And

1625
02:57:13.490 --> 02:57:22.749
Orlando Sequera: also we to be able to have this system in place that can help us to send the documents when needed. So timely distribution of documents.

1626
02:57:26.470 --> 02:57:27.580
Orlando Sequera: We should

1627
02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:33.740
Orlando Sequera: taylor this tailoring, this artifacts that is.

1628
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:35.360
Orlando Sequera: this is

1629
02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:41.000
Orlando Sequera: This is a typical list. It's not exclusive or prescriptive, but this is a typical list and

1630
02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:44.360
Orlando Sequera: the Pm. And the team they're gonna

1631
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:56.339
Orlando Sequera: select. They write artifacts to use on their specific project, and they should have the flexibility to tailor this specific artifacts for their project.

1632
02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:10.630
Orlando Sequera: You're not you. You're not going to use every single process, every single input to the tool and technique that we have covered in every single project. But these are the typical ones that you're going to be using for predicted projects. We're going to have

1633
02:58:11.390 --> 02:58:13.009
Orlando Sequera: company management plan.

1634
02:58:13.180 --> 02:58:21.540
Orlando Sequera: We're going to have a project. Charter. Change requests, scope, baseline schedule based on cost, baseline, and all the different subsidiary plans one.

1635
02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:23.090
Orlando Sequera: But for

1636
02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:26.189
Orlando Sequera: add your projects and hybrid projects. We have

1637
02:58:26.290 --> 02:58:36.970
Orlando Sequera: a project management plan as well, a product, roadmap task force, experiments for backlog and spring backlog. But we can also have an agile

1638
02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:38.910
Orlando Sequera: project. Charter. So

1639
02:58:39.060 --> 02:58:53.779
Orlando Sequera: this is not. This is the typical ones, but they are not exclusive or prescriptive that can change. We can have a an agile project, charter as well, but they need to be tailored to your specific project.

1640
02:58:54.730 --> 02:58:57.830
Orlando Sequera: And this artifacts. As I said.

1641
02:58:57.860 --> 02:59:00.470
Orlando Sequera: they're going to be evolving over time.

1642
02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:21.099
Orlando Sequera: We have to maintain this the keep track of those changes, and for that we have to have in place a configuration management plan that can help us to understand how changes, how product information is going to be recorded and updated in this different artifacts.

1643
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:27.439
Orlando Sequera: because changes in the scope that's gonna touch multiple errors, not just the scope you're gonna have to.

1644
02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:31.930
Orlando Sequera: Chances. Are You're gonna have to change your schedule, changed your budget.

1645
02:59:32.350 --> 02:59:44.630
Orlando Sequera: change your resources, etc. So you got to have a configuration management plan that can help you to track those changes, and also a as a system, a configuration management system to

1646
02:59:45.310 --> 02:59:50.929
Orlando Sequera: practice changes, monitor these changes and control these changes to these artifacts.

1647
02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:53.860
Orlando Sequera: A super important aspect

1648
02:59:54.390 --> 02:59:59.420
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to configuration. Management is also version control.

1649
02:59:59.600 --> 03:00:00.340
Orlando Sequera: But

1650
03:00:00.530 --> 03:00:16.869
Orlando Sequera: nowadays most of the even, the the most common systems like sharepoint. For example, they this is pretty much standard functionality. They create a new version number for you. They put a date time a day timestamp, and also

1651
03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:28.349
Orlando Sequera: they keep track of the last user that made the changes. But this is really important, because you need to make sure that you're working with the most up to date version of those artifacts at all times.

1652
03:00:28.770 --> 03:00:31.329
Orlando Sequera: Okay, super super super important.

1653
03:00:32.130 --> 03:00:33.789
Orlando Sequera: It's a system that

1654
03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:39.030
Orlando Sequera: it's gonna record changes in a file that allows users to make changes as needed

1655
03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:40.610
Orlando Sequera: in.

1656
03:00:41.810 --> 03:00:43.509
Orlando Sequera: We have cover

1657
03:00:43.930 --> 03:00:45.250
Orlando Sequera: for the card effects.

1658
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:54.320
Orlando Sequera: We talked about the requirements. What when we're in, Who for managing public artifacts and validate that this work, information is kept under control.

1659
03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:58.660
Orlando Sequera: we cover all the content for the first section.

1660
03:00:58.740 --> 03:01:12.169
Orlando Sequera: And now i'm going to address some of the questions until we still have a few minutes before we go and break. So what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take the time to address some of the questions in the Q. A. Section.

1661
03:01:13.330 --> 03:01:16.290
Orlando Sequera: Please make sure that you vote on the on those questions.

1662
03:01:26.570 --> 03:01:28.410
Okay.

1663
03:01:36.540 --> 03:01:37.909
Orlando Sequera: One question

1664
03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:48.840
Orlando Sequera: in the Ito understands for impulse students at the nicks and outputs of the PIN book the pretty much, and plans using the input of other plans. That's what we're saying here with integration.

1665
03:01:49.430 --> 03:01:52.299
Orlando Sequera: as we're saying here with integration. So

1666
03:01:52.560 --> 03:02:05.310
Orlando Sequera: a but developing the also requires other plan outputs as an input. Well, we've been talking about the subsidiary plans, but they all need to come together. That happens in integration and the outcome

1667
03:02:05.470 --> 03:02:06.640
Orlando Sequera: the output

1668
03:02:07.310 --> 03:02:10.289
Orlando Sequera: in integration. The main output is going to be

1669
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:12.520
Orlando Sequera: the project management plan.

1670
03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:25.669
Orlando Sequera: Another question with an organization's, collections of lessons learned be considered an opa. Yes, and that's what we call lessons learned repository.

1671
03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:34.800
Orlando Sequera: How close are the practic sense to real extent very close

1672
03:02:34.850 --> 03:02:38.090
Orlando Sequera: The test Prep. Questions are very close.

1673
03:02:44.220 --> 03:02:49.530
Orlando Sequera: Another question regarding my apologies

1674
03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:57.200
Orlando Sequera: regarding the weather in the desert representing

1675
03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:04.230
Orlando Sequera: an unplanned risk UN identified risk.

1676
03:03:04.310 --> 03:03:19.390
Orlando Sequera: We're in the Pmp Process team book. If there, if anywhere, does it refer to basic steps in a more bullet point form. What? When in that situation, would you escalate the on plan? Risk as an issue? Well, first of all, you can plan for it.

1677
03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:20.480
Orlando Sequera: do you?

1678
03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:25.140
Orlando Sequera: The answer to that is going to be? You have to use management reserves.

1679
03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:26.970
Orlando Sequera: and what

1680
03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:31.439
Orlando Sequera: Pmi is recommending this to look is to review the project management

1681
03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:35.480
Orlando Sequera: to really prevention plan specifically the chapter of the

1682
03:03:36.190 --> 03:03:45.200
Orlando Sequera: Risk management plan. That's what they're telling you. Okay, that's why we created Those are the rules that we're going to follow to address

1683
03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:46.270
Orlando Sequera: risk.

1684
03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:56.089
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and you're gonna have to use management reserves. But you need authorization for that. You can't. You don't have the 30 as a Pm. To use

1685
03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:58.390
Orlando Sequera: Project a

1686
03:03:58.430 --> 03:04:09.339
Orlando Sequera: management reserves. You need authorization for that contingency reserves. You have authorization. You don't need to ask for permission to use contingency reserves.

1687
03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:22.660
Orlando Sequera: Another question: what should we do as a Pm. To take team from one step to another, oversight mentoring, coaching.

1688
03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:25.820
Orlando Sequera: and using servant leadership.

1689
03:04:26.810 --> 03:04:27.520
Okay.

1690
03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:35.179
Orlando Sequera: Is there a timeframe for each stage of talk when faces of them building? No.

1691
03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:38.680
Orlando Sequera: that there's not a set timeframe for that?

1692
03:04:40.860 --> 03:04:46.839
Orlando Sequera: Why is this just for agile? You will have to give a little bit more context in your question.

1693
03:04:48.290 --> 03:04:57.359
Orlando Sequera: Covid is forcing many teams to move to virtual have percent of unique Chinese to manager. Yes, and we're giving you best

1694
03:04:57.610 --> 03:05:01.130
Orlando Sequera: practices to address that situation. But that's true statement.

1695
03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:04.340
Orlando Sequera: Him

1696
03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:14.639
Orlando Sequera: I would have thought that risk log will have been on the list of Taylor artifacts. I know it is in a completely. We would have thought that it risk risk register.

1697
03:05:15.170 --> 03:05:20.570
Orlando Sequera: Well, yes, it is an artifact that needs to be tailored, that is. yes.

1698
03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:34.520
Orlando Sequera: how can we fat another question. How can we fast track the team for talkman. There's no that. There's a silver bullet that work.

1699
03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:36.409
Orlando Sequera: Work with them

1700
03:05:36.590 --> 03:05:43.310
Orlando Sequera: a oversight and work with them and be at leader. Be a servant leader for your team last.

1701
03:05:43.470 --> 03:05:46.320
Orlando Sequera: But there's not a magic answer for that.

1702
03:05:48.650 --> 03:05:49.340
so

1703
03:05:52.160 --> 03:06:02.219
Orlando Sequera: okay, will the requirements for civilizations Consider a configuration management system for artifacts. It's part of it. Yes, it's one of those artifacts that you have to maintain. So yeah.

1704
03:06:04.890 --> 03:06:18.529
Orlando Sequera: in real life, working environments do project managers have access to a suite of template resources to ensure. They have all the products, plans, etc., needed to go forward with the project. Yes, and the name of that is a Project Management office.

1705
03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:20.220
Orlando Sequera: Pmo.

1706
03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:30.080
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1707
03:06:33.140 --> 03:06:36.710
Orlando Sequera: What is the print? That's an iteration? It's a time box

1708
03:06:36.810 --> 03:06:40.239
Orlando Sequera: timeframe in which the team is gonna work on developing features

1709
03:06:47.290 --> 03:06:52.709
Orlando Sequera: get an opportunity to become a threat. a positive re becoming a negative risk.

1710
03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:55.869
Orlando Sequera: It could happen, but it's not common.

1711
03:06:56.360 --> 03:06:58.000
Orlando Sequera: I don't really have an

1712
03:06:58.150 --> 03:07:00.289
Orlando Sequera: an example that I can think of. But

1713
03:07:00.390 --> 03:07:04.720
Orlando Sequera: my take is that you're kind of overthinking it a little bit.

1714
03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:09.760
Orlando Sequera: Negative risks. You need to identify them, analyze them and

1715
03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:22.319
Orlando Sequera: come up with a response. Positive risk the same. And that's what we need to make sure that we know for the exempt. But i'm not ruling that possibility. I'm sure it is possible

1716
03:07:25.340 --> 03:07:31.050
Orlando Sequera: a predictive approach is more likely to be for risk. Adverse situations.

1717
03:07:35.180 --> 03:07:36.670
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Sorry

1718
03:07:44.930 --> 03:07:59.879
Orlando Sequera: and agile, is more for seeking situation. Not necessarily. Not necessarily. No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't go by that. A predictive approach is better. Look at this scope. A predictive approach is better in situations. In this, when the scope is well defined, and when or well understood.

1719
03:07:59.890 --> 03:08:05.759
Orlando Sequera: and an adaptive approach works better in situations; and we just in which the scope is very complex.

1720
03:08:06.020 --> 03:08:06.860
Orlando Sequera: for

1721
03:08:06.980 --> 03:08:09.380
Orlando Sequera: if we know, going in that he has.

1722
03:08:09.540 --> 03:08:16.780
Orlando Sequera: that is going to be a lot of changes. Look at it from the scope perspective, not from the risk perspective. That is my

1723
03:08:17.390 --> 03:08:19.409
Orlando Sequera: my recommendation.

1724
03:08:25.090 --> 03:08:26.330
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1725
03:08:34.020 --> 03:08:35.389
Orlando Sequera: how can we keep

1726
03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:37.710
Orlando Sequera: team members in track

1727
03:08:37.850 --> 03:08:43.659
Orlando Sequera: of performing stage One new member, when new team member joins. You're going to go back to

1728
03:08:43.700 --> 03:08:44.640
Orlando Sequera: they

1729
03:08:44.950 --> 03:08:55.540
Orlando Sequera: to forming. Unfortunately, it's the clocks gonna be reset. So you have to work with your team to make sure that they get out of it as quickly as possible. But it's gonna be

1730
03:09:00.170 --> 03:09:04.900
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be a reset, and it's going to go back to a

1731
03:09:07.010 --> 03:09:09.709
Orlando Sequera: is going to go back to to forming

1732
03:09:10.580 --> 03:09:18.689
Orlando Sequera: a therapy, and my library would probably document templates. Yeah, I mentioned that multiple times. It is Www. Dot project management.com

1733
03:09:31.290 --> 03:09:35.910
Orlando Sequera: the difference between Pmo. And P. 3 M. I don't know what P. 3 M. Stands for, so

1734
03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:37.909
Orlando Sequera: I don't know.

1735
03:09:40.750 --> 03:09:45.309
Orlando Sequera: How do you deal with a disruptive team member? We're not talking about that When we get to conflict management.

1736
03:10:07.260 --> 03:10:11.330
Orlando Sequera: what which leadership that is best, Our leadership staff serve and leadership

1737
03:10:19.970 --> 03:10:21.920
Orlando Sequera: all right. So

1738
03:10:27.250 --> 03:10:28.660
Orlando Sequera: I

1739
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:35.709
Orlando Sequera: think that most of the Content related questions have been addressed, and we are ready for our break

1740
03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:40.060
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna take a one-hour break. Please remember, do not log off.

1741
03:10:40.530 --> 03:10:44.669
Orlando Sequera: We are going to be playing important videos.

1742
03:10:44.700 --> 03:10:46.760
Orlando Sequera: Our mentors are going to play important videos.

1743
03:10:46.850 --> 03:10:54.939
Orlando Sequera: and we'll be back in an hour. Okay, enjoy your break. Thank you very much, and we'll do it again when we come back. Enjoy your break

1744
03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:00.250
Orlando Sequera: all right, Welcome back everyone

1745
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:03.839
Orlando Sequera: hopefully. You enjoyed your

1746
03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:05.840
Orlando Sequera: your break.

1747
03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:09.409
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to continue with our

1748
03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:12.800
Orlando Sequera: with part 2 of session number 4.

1749
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:18.020
Orlando Sequera: I was reviewing briefly

1750
03:11:18.990 --> 03:11:23.310
Orlando Sequera: the Q. And a and didn't really see any content related

1751
03:11:24.330 --> 03:11:25.630
Orlando Sequera: questions.

1752
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:29.539
Orlando Sequera: So we're gonna continue with our

1753
03:11:31.210 --> 03:11:32.580
Orlando Sequera: with our

1754
03:11:32.770 --> 03:11:35.420
Orlando Sequera: content, and we'll have

1755
03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:39.510
Orlando Sequera: some stopping points after we cover some of the topics to address

1756
03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:45.489
Orlando Sequera: the questions that you might have. Alright, so the next topic that we're going to be covering

1757
03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:56.099
Orlando Sequera: is how to empower the team. So remember that we are working out less on Number 4 is about how to lead the team, how to work with the people. This content is

1758
03:11:57.470 --> 03:11:59.310
Orlando Sequera: a mainly related

1759
03:11:59.590 --> 03:12:15.879
Orlando Sequera: to the people domain. Member. That's one of the domains that you have to cover for the Pmp. Exam. We have 3. We have people domain. That accounts for 42 of the questions. So this content is really important. Almost half of the questions are going to be related to

1760
03:12:16.200 --> 03:12:19.609
Orlando Sequera: this specific domain people domain. Then

1761
03:12:19.660 --> 03:12:38.890
Orlando Sequera: we have the process domain which we have covered all those different areas in planning and all the different areas of your project, and mainly that is part of the process domain. That accounts for 50 of the questions, and then something that we cover mainly day, one which is business environment. That is the third.

1762
03:12:39.300 --> 03:12:46.979
Orlando Sequera: and probably that's the new addition for this version of the Pmp. Exam. That accounts for 8% of the questions

1763
03:12:47.220 --> 03:12:49.190
Orlando Sequera: in your Pmp. Exempt

1764
03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:52.430
Orlando Sequera: all right, so empowering the team.

1765
03:12:52.610 --> 03:12:54.089
Orlando Sequera: This is critical.

1766
03:12:55.280 --> 03:12:59.180
Orlando Sequera: A empowering the team, and

1767
03:12:59.330 --> 03:13:04.389
Orlando Sequera: this, mainly started with Agile, is part of the agile mindset.

1768
03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:05.660
Orlando Sequera: But

1769
03:13:05.710 --> 03:13:10.330
Orlando Sequera: it is so powerful, useful, and helps teams

1770
03:13:10.350 --> 03:13:12.540
Orlando Sequera: to be successful that he has

1771
03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:22.120
Orlando Sequera: and made its way to hybrid approaches, and also to predictive approaches in which

1772
03:13:22.370 --> 03:13:33.479
Orlando Sequera: that benefit from empower team members that can help project team project managers in making the best decisions possible for the project is basically boils down to

1773
03:13:34.130 --> 03:13:35.810
Orlando Sequera: letting the teams.

1774
03:13:35.850 --> 03:13:42.749
Orlando Sequera: It take a more active role in the decision making process, not just relying on

1775
03:13:42.930 --> 03:13:47.899
Orlando Sequera: on on the Pm. Leveraging that expertise that comes from

1776
03:13:48.100 --> 03:13:49.210
Orlando Sequera: a

1777
03:13:49.250 --> 03:13:53.530
Orlando Sequera: doing the work which is, which is what the team members do.

1778
03:13:53.720 --> 03:13:55.310
Orlando Sequera: Right? So

1779
03:13:55.590 --> 03:14:00.139
Orlando Sequera: it is in our context is, the the idea should be

1780
03:14:00.180 --> 03:14:04.649
Orlando Sequera: to create an environment where individual team members are empowered to

1781
03:14:04.900 --> 03:14:10.160
Orlando Sequera: tribute with their ideas. Okay, we should foster that collaboration.

1782
03:14:11.930 --> 03:14:13.500
Orlando Sequera: and

1783
03:14:16.460 --> 03:14:22.910
Orlando Sequera: is to share a little bit about empowering teams with emotional intelligence and fluid communication.

1784
03:14:23.430 --> 03:14:24.449
Orlando Sequera: The

1785
03:14:24.530 --> 03:14:26.000
Orlando Sequera: this is

1786
03:14:26.670 --> 03:14:28.339
Orlando Sequera: a case study

1787
03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:30.100
Orlando Sequera: in 26

1788
03:14:30.370 --> 03:14:34.960
Orlando Sequera: after years of finalizing interviews and data from more than a 100 different teams.

1789
03:14:35.210 --> 03:14:48.299
Orlando Sequera: Google Researchers found that the drivers of effective team performance are the group's average level of emotional intelligence and a high degree communication between members. So

1790
03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:51.839
Orlando Sequera: with this we're trying to say that there is some data

1791
03:14:51.930 --> 03:14:58.620
Orlando Sequera: behind the importance of empowering teams. Even if we are following a predictive approach

1792
03:14:59.470 --> 03:15:00.990
Orlando Sequera: and also

1793
03:15:02.140 --> 03:15:20.589
Orlando Sequera: a the level of communication. So that's why this 2 topics are coming more and more and more to the forefront because they have an impact on effective team performance. There's a lot of research that has been done in this regard, and this is becoming more and more more the normal.

1794
03:15:20.770 --> 03:15:21.720
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

1795
03:15:21.870 --> 03:15:22.900
Orlando Sequera: And

1796
03:15:26.890 --> 03:15:28.540
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1797
03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:35.630
Orlando Sequera: empowerment team, uni, team, unity and autonomy. Those are

1798
03:15:35.740 --> 03:15:39.199
Orlando Sequera: characteristics that Amy High performing team

1799
03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:40.199
Orlando Sequera: shoot.

1800
03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:43.310
Orlando Sequera: cultivate, regardless of the setting

1801
03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:44.480
Orlando Sequera: that is

1802
03:15:45.490 --> 03:15:47.580
Orlando Sequera: it that is extremely important

1803
03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:48.640
Orlando Sequera: people

1804
03:15:48.990 --> 03:15:50.759
Orlando Sequera: are going to contribute

1805
03:15:50.780 --> 03:15:52.110
Orlando Sequera: their best

1806
03:15:52.200 --> 03:15:53.340
Orlando Sequera: when

1807
03:15:54.610 --> 03:16:00.250
Orlando Sequera: they they feel proud of what they do, and that they, when they feel empower.

1808
03:16:01.100 --> 03:16:02.460
Orlando Sequera: Okay. But

1809
03:16:02.680 --> 03:16:08.320
Orlando Sequera: with great power comes great responsibility. it's like quote from a movie. Probably some of you might

1810
03:16:08.430 --> 03:16:09.400
Orlando Sequera: picking it

1811
03:16:09.430 --> 03:16:22.490
Orlando Sequera: with great power. Come, comes comes great responsibility. So we're giving you more power. We're trusting you in and being part of the decision making process, but it's also increasing the level of responsibility.

1812
03:16:22.930 --> 03:16:27.880
Orlando Sequera: The team needs to be in power to make decisions in a collaborative way.

1813
03:16:28.290 --> 03:16:36.359
Orlando Sequera: and this is going to help you with motivation. This is going to help you with increase it. That increasing that sense of unity.

1814
03:16:36.990 --> 03:16:38.640
Orlando Sequera: and is also

1815
03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:45.990
Orlando Sequera: going to help with the decision making process. We keep saying that we should involve them, we should involve. And this is how we do it by given them

1816
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:48.070
Orlando Sequera: the power, and

1817
03:16:48.970 --> 03:16:55.479
Orlando Sequera: they that they are part of the process. If you are able to follow this approach

1818
03:16:55.720 --> 03:17:04.240
Orlando Sequera: you, Chances are you're going to be. Increase the the level of success in your project in the way you're working with a team a

1819
03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:08.869
Orlando Sequera: in agile. As I mentioned before, this is a must. But

1820
03:17:09.420 --> 03:17:22.710
Orlando Sequera: given the fact that high performing teams, regardless of the approach this has been, this has been proven to be successful. It's becoming more and more common. Amen. Even in predictive approaches, and of course, in hybrid approaches. Okay.

1821
03:17:23.070 --> 03:17:32.599
Orlando Sequera: the team recognizes the power and the influence as as an empower cohesive unit. That's the goal. That's how we can reach that talkman later stage of

1822
03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:33.880
Orlando Sequera: performing.

1823
03:17:34.170 --> 03:17:41.429
Orlando Sequera: This is gonna help with the decision making process, and also with a problem solving process as well.

1824
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:48.589
Orlando Sequera: Okay, given them the power giving them responsibility and prioritizing team unity over individual contributions.

1825
03:17:49.070 --> 03:18:08.469
Orlando Sequera: I am a 100% sure that for those of you that come from the military. This is the first time you see this. But this is a night translation of your skill. Set that you learn in the in the military life. Now you can use those principles, and they translate nicely into your civilian life.

1826
03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:10.610
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1827
03:18:10.780 --> 03:18:12.310
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect.

1828
03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:28.670
Orlando Sequera: We have to support diversity. As we said, most teams are going to be diverse nowadays. It's about equity means about inclusion. Empowering teams of as a cohesive unit. But that also means that we're going to respect the individuals with respect

1829
03:18:28.720 --> 03:18:32.459
Orlando Sequera: their culture that we're going to respect diversity. Okay.

1830
03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:52.249
Orlando Sequera: we have to create an an environment in which people feel safe to express their opinions. But we're taking into account their the diversity, their culture. It's about respect. Let's go back to the values right. Starting with respect, we have to support it through some of our building initiatives and

1831
03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:54.750
Orlando Sequera: collaborative culture in

1832
03:18:54.910 --> 03:19:01.650
Orlando Sequera: acting and leading with empathy when we take into account others we care of our other people.

1833
03:19:02.770 --> 03:19:07.840
Orlando Sequera: That means that we also have to work on creating that

1834
03:19:08.170 --> 03:19:10.210
Orlando Sequera: psychological safety

1835
03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:13.110
Orlando Sequera: in order to embrace diversity.

1836
03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:20.240
Orlando Sequera: That is really important. So we easier set than done this. This is something that

1837
03:19:20.650 --> 03:19:22.250
Orlando Sequera: working it's gonna

1838
03:19:22.300 --> 03:19:27.489
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be. It takes a lot of effort, but it's possible we should strive to achieve

1839
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:28.369
Orlando Sequera: it.

1840
03:19:28.450 --> 03:19:31.479
Orlando Sequera: The the environment in which the team members feel

1841
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:34.349
Orlando Sequera: safe enough to express their opinions.

1842
03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:48.570
Orlando Sequera: they feel safe enough to express their ideas without thinking or fearing, let alone retaliation. So we have to promote a healthy work, environment. Basically it's about embracing Diversity

1843
03:19:48.690 --> 03:20:05.389
Orlando Sequera: Building Trust with your team members with one another, and keeping the the decision making process, keeping those ethical principles following that code of ethics at all times. So people should feel comfortable being who they are at work. That's what we're trying to say.

1844
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:10.539
Orlando Sequera: but that takes us to another arena, in which

1845
03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:20.950
Orlando Sequera: It means that we we need to understand. People need to understand people a little bit more, and there is a lot of research that has been done

1846
03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:24.899
Orlando Sequera: in that arena, and that's what we call motivational theories.

1847
03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:27.110
Orlando Sequera: A:

1848
03:20:27.570 --> 03:20:31.110
Orlando Sequera: It is important to work at least.

1849
03:20:31.300 --> 03:20:45.429
Orlando Sequera: having an idea of this a general idea of this, this different motivational theories to understand People's behavior. That's that's the goal that you get for understanding these different motivational theories that have been around for a long time. It's not something new.

1850
03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:51.460
Orlando Sequera: It is a standard knowledge area for any business practitioner, not just for project managers.

1851
03:20:51.600 --> 03:21:10.250
Orlando Sequera: but we can benefit from understanding what motivates people in the organization that because we're working with people from day one we start saying, you're going to be. You're going to be working with your protein, Mem: correcting members that are diverse. You're going to be working with stakeholders. You're going to be working with multiple people. So it is a good idea to also understand

1852
03:21:10.260 --> 03:21:20.920
Orlando Sequera: how what motivates different people, and is. Take a look at this different theories that are going to help us to understand that we're going to start with massless pyramid of

1853
03:21:21.010 --> 03:21:23.869
Orlando Sequera: the hierarchy of meat myths.

1854
03:21:23.980 --> 03:21:35.019
Orlando Sequera: We have Hersburg's a motivation. Hygiene Theory Mcgregor's X and Y. Theory X. And Y. And by Cleveland's achievement motivation theory. Okay

1855
03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:37.160
Orlando Sequera: for.

1856
03:21:37.880 --> 03:21:42.069
Orlando Sequera: And whenever I see this slide, this brings me back to my college years.

1857
03:21:42.100 --> 03:21:42.869
it

1858
03:21:42.940 --> 03:21:48.750
Orlando Sequera: Abraham Maslow. He came up with this long time ago a over 70 years ago.

1859
03:21:49.050 --> 03:21:52.240
Orlando Sequera: And this basically

1860
03:21:52.660 --> 03:22:05.849
Orlando Sequera: is he he grouped the human, the human needs into these 5 categories. That is also known as the hierarchy of needs or mass Rose permit. It is Abraham Maslow.

1861
03:22:05.930 --> 03:22:09.389
Orlando Sequera: and really helps to understand

1862
03:22:09.690 --> 03:22:10.480
Orlando Sequera: what

1863
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:15.669
Orlando Sequera: it really helps in understanding people. So we start with the bottom of the pyramid.

1864
03:22:16.460 --> 03:22:23.090
Orlando Sequera: The physiological needs are the basic elements that any human being needs in order to leave. And we're talking about

1865
03:22:23.420 --> 03:22:25.530
Orlando Sequera: food, water, sleep.

1866
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:26.460
Orlando Sequera: air.

1867
03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:31.410
Orlando Sequera: etc. So those are the physiological needs there at the bottom of the pyramid.

1868
03:22:31.530 --> 03:22:35.849
Orlando Sequera: Okay, then, the next level is safety. Those are

1869
03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:41.660
Orlando Sequera: the items that I that any person needs to feel safe from physical and economic harm.

1870
03:22:43.150 --> 03:22:44.780
Orlando Sequera: The next level

1871
03:22:45.420 --> 03:22:46.690
Orlando Sequera: is about

1872
03:22:47.470 --> 03:22:57.769
Orlando Sequera: belonging or social needs, and this is the desire that any human being has to in order to be part of a group or receive affection and

1873
03:22:58.060 --> 03:22:59.100
Orlando Sequera: feel that

1874
03:22:59.120 --> 03:23:09.249
Orlando Sequera: belonging, feel that they're part of something that's belonging. Then we have steam. This has to do with recognition received from mothers as well as with Selfs team.

1875
03:23:09.280 --> 03:23:10.430
Orlando Sequera: and they

1876
03:23:10.530 --> 03:23:12.369
Orlando Sequera: top of the permit we have

1877
03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:20.179
Orlando Sequera: the self-actualization. These are the desires that in any individual has about self-fulfilling and developing to the full potential.

1878
03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:24.109
Orlando Sequera: So you might be wondering great. This is a theory. How is this

1879
03:23:24.210 --> 03:23:25.880
Orlando Sequera: applicable to

1880
03:23:26.560 --> 03:23:30.950
Orlando Sequera: project management working with the project team and even working with stakeholders? Well.

1881
03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:34.320
Orlando Sequera: if you start seeing, for example.

1882
03:23:34.500 --> 03:23:35.539
Orlando Sequera: a project

1883
03:23:35.650 --> 03:23:44.749
Orlando Sequera: team member that is starting to the performance is not where it should be, and it starts to

1884
03:23:44.930 --> 03:23:49.259
Orlando Sequera: The performance starts to, software and you see that the person

1885
03:23:49.300 --> 03:24:08.189
Orlando Sequera: normally it's very it's it's always communicating. Very active. Is someone that is really on top of things you start seeing. Maybe there is something that is happening that one of these levels, maybe at the safety level, because you need to. It's about performance right? So as a good project manager. You want to reach out to the

1886
03:24:08.260 --> 03:24:11.000
Orlando Sequera: to the team member to try to understand what's going on

1887
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:23.120
Orlando Sequera: right. It's not a immediately going and using disciplinary sanctions. That's not the way we want to work with. People try to understand where they're coming from, and this is one way, maybe something at the

1888
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:42.770
Orlando Sequera: safety need. Maybe they're having some financial problems, or they having some going through some personal situations and try to understand that where they're coming from and try to find a way to help them. So that is where a massless pyramid can help us. A. Because if any of these levels, specially going

1889
03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:52.090
Orlando Sequera: at the ones at the bottom are being affected. That's going to have an impact on the performance of the team members. So we can use this to understand possible

1890
03:24:52.120 --> 03:25:04.710
Orlando Sequera: problems that might have in that might be a current within your with your team members. So it's one way. We also have motivation hygiene theory, and this is about.

1891
03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:05.720
Orlando Sequera: A

1892
03:25:06.770 --> 03:25:08.770
Orlando Sequera: We have hygiene factors.

1893
03:25:08.920 --> 03:25:10.980
Orlando Sequera: and we have motivators.

1894
03:25:11.060 --> 03:25:11.850
Orlando Sequera: So

1895
03:25:11.900 --> 03:25:14.260
Orlando Sequera: it's also known as the two-factor theory.

1896
03:25:14.310 --> 03:25:31.530
Orlando Sequera: The hygiene factors relate to working conditions a stable job a good relationship with management and co-workers, and then motivating factors relate to the feelings of achievement recognition and career advancement. Ideally they should be a balance

1897
03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:46.429
Orlando Sequera: and this changes from individual to individual. But when it comes to hygiene issues according to herstworks, by the way, you cannot motivate employees, but you can minimize this satisfaction. If it's handled properly, they can only dissatisfied if

1898
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:48.989
Orlando Sequera: if they are absent or mishandled

1899
03:25:49.340 --> 03:26:05.680
Orlando Sequera: hygiene topics, they cover company policies, supervision salary interpersonal relations, working conditions, any issues related to the employees environment. But what we have in in the far right, the motivators that's a little bit different.

1900
03:26:05.690 --> 03:26:12.489
Orlando Sequera: They create satisfaction by fulfilling individual needs or meaning and personal growth.

1901
03:26:12.610 --> 03:26:14.170
Orlando Sequera: They are issues like

1902
03:26:14.430 --> 03:26:21.880
Orlando Sequera: achievement, recognition, the work itself, engagement, responsibility, and advancement.

1903
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:29.839
Orlando Sequera: Once the hygiene errors are addressed, then the motivators are going to promote job satisfaction and encourage productivity.

1904
03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:32.479
Orlando Sequera: That's according to her experts.

1905
03:26:32.830 --> 03:26:37.349
Orlando Sequera: We also have Mcgregor's theory, X and

1906
03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:38.810
Orlando Sequera: theory. Why?

1907
03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:41.280
Orlando Sequera: So

1908
03:26:42.180 --> 03:26:44.150
Orlando Sequera: 2 theories? And this is

1909
03:26:44.350 --> 03:26:45.460
Orlando Sequera: also

1910
03:26:45.490 --> 03:26:52.109
Orlando Sequera: something that we can use to understand. What type of management do we have to work with, and it's a good way to understand that

1911
03:26:52.160 --> 03:27:02.609
Orlando Sequera: you are going to find managers, and this is, according to Mcgregor's, by the way, in the has that did a lot of work in this field of social psychology and understanding people's, behaviors, and organizations.

1912
03:27:03.310 --> 03:27:07.680
Orlando Sequera: There are some managers that follow the theory X approach.

1913
03:27:07.940 --> 03:27:09.420
Orlando Sequera: They are

1914
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:13.349
Orlando Sequera: pessimists when it comes to people's behavior.

1915
03:27:13.380 --> 03:27:20.220
Orlando Sequera: and they think that most people don't like to work, and they avoid work.

1916
03:27:20.720 --> 03:27:25.629
Orlando Sequera: and they think that people avoiding free responsibility

1917
03:27:25.650 --> 03:27:31.110
Orlando Sequera: and based on their belief, they follow that carrot and stick approach in which

1918
03:27:31.230 --> 03:27:36.219
Orlando Sequera: people need to be directed. Okay, that's what we call an authoritarian.

1919
03:27:36.300 --> 03:27:43.099
Orlando Sequera: But there are some other managers is that are basically the opposite right? They They are the theory. Why

1920
03:27:43.310 --> 03:27:49.730
Orlando Sequera: type of managers, and this is people. They think that people want to work and enjoy it.

1921
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:56.619
Orlando Sequera: And management doesn't need to to to micromanage what they do, and constantly super supervise.

1922
03:27:56.720 --> 03:27:57.750
Orlando Sequera: and

1923
03:27:58.670 --> 03:28:17.119
Orlando Sequera: a people are looking for satisfaction, and they are Look, they don't require that much direction. Okay. So some people tend to think of this as theory X: that's all school. That's the old way of doing things. And then theory. Why, it's a little bit more modern. No, necessarily. You're going to find this

1924
03:28:17.130 --> 03:28:29.160
Orlando Sequera: in organizations that these 2 coexist, so it's one way for us to to decipher a the management style of some managers that we're working with in our projects.

1925
03:28:29.420 --> 03:28:32.289
Orlando Sequera: Then we have Mac

1926
03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:35.440
Orlando Sequera: achievement, motivation

1927
03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:36.720
Orlando Sequera: theory.

1928
03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:41.159
Orlando Sequera: and according to Mcclelland, he says that an individual

1929
03:28:41.190 --> 03:28:46.090
Orlando Sequera: needs are shaped by their experiences, what they go through

1930
03:28:46.230 --> 03:28:51.689
Orlando Sequera: and depending on culture and life experiences. And he says that there are 3 needs.

1931
03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:55.420
Orlando Sequera: and one becomes dominant in our personalities

1932
03:28:55.940 --> 03:28:57.260
Orlando Sequera: and

1933
03:28:58.030 --> 03:29:06.759
Orlando Sequera: effective project managers. They need to know how to motivate each type of individual and try to find some balance. Okay. So

1934
03:29:07.020 --> 03:29:08.199
Orlando Sequera: the 3

1935
03:29:09.280 --> 03:29:10.480
Orlando Sequera: categories

1936
03:29:11.340 --> 03:29:15.249
Orlando Sequera: for these achievement motivation theory of Mclean are

1937
03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:17.070
Orlando Sequera: achievement, the first one.

1938
03:29:17.250 --> 03:29:26.859
Orlando Sequera: the If an individual has a high need for achievement. This is someone that has a strong set, a strong need to accomplish challenging goals.

1939
03:29:26.980 --> 03:29:29.370
Orlando Sequera: They take calculated risks

1940
03:29:29.390 --> 03:29:42.239
Orlando Sequera: to accomplish their their goals, and also they like to receive regular feedback on the progress and achievements, and they like to work alone in most cases. So.

1941
03:29:42.430 --> 03:29:50.460
Orlando Sequera: if they have an high need for achievement, those are the characteristics of someone that has a high need for achievement. Then the second one is affiliation.

1942
03:29:51.060 --> 03:29:52.190
Orlando Sequera: People that

1943
03:29:52.290 --> 03:29:55.190
Orlando Sequera: one to feel that they belong to a group.

1944
03:29:55.340 --> 03:29:57.080
Orlando Sequera: They want to be liked.

1945
03:29:57.540 --> 03:30:07.910
Orlando Sequera: and by the rest of the people they favor collaboration over competition, and they don't like high risk or uncertainty, and then we have

1946
03:30:08.310 --> 03:30:16.370
Orlando Sequera: power people to have a high need for power. These are people that want to control and influence others.

1947
03:30:16.440 --> 03:30:19.139
Orlando Sequera: They enjoy competition and winning.

1948
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:23.410
Orlando Sequera: They enjoyed their status on recognition, and they like to win arguments.

1949
03:30:23.530 --> 03:30:28.800
Orlando Sequera: Usually good managers. They tend to have a high need for power.

1950
03:30:29.460 --> 03:30:43.749
Orlando Sequera: and I need for achievement and affiliation. It's going to be at the bottom. They don't. They're okay, not being well liked by others, They're okay with that. But we have other people that have a higher need for affiliation. They usually don't make the best managers.

1951
03:30:43.760 --> 03:30:50.329
Orlando Sequera: So that's another way to understand how people, but they ideally they should be a violence, right? We we should try to find

1952
03:30:50.390 --> 03:30:51.810
Orlando Sequera: a balance, and

1953
03:30:51.930 --> 03:30:53.800
Orlando Sequera: we should use this intel

1954
03:30:54.290 --> 03:31:02.420
Orlando Sequera: to craft roles around team members strength. Okay, so we can balance it out as much as possible in our project team.

1955
03:31:03.870 --> 03:31:09.299
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect that we have to take into account in leading the team is.

1956
03:31:10.920 --> 03:31:19.040
Orlando Sequera: besides the theories. The theories are going to help us to understand people, but this is something that we have mentioned before. This is also going to help us to

1957
03:31:19.140 --> 03:31:23.470
Orlando Sequera: a leader teams is to make sure that those

1958
03:31:23.780 --> 03:31:29.710
Orlando Sequera: they those ground rules that we created in our with our team charter

1959
03:31:29.730 --> 03:31:33.410
Orlando Sequera: with the team following a collaborative approach our

1960
03:31:33.800 --> 03:31:39.080
Orlando Sequera: actually used are being used. So we gotta make sure that that's the case.

1961
03:31:39.180 --> 03:31:40.080
Orlando Sequera: Then

1962
03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:51.399
Orlando Sequera: do we have them visible? Is everybody aware of the fact? We're so everybody familiar with the location of the team charter containing the team ground rules.

1963
03:31:51.940 --> 03:31:57.199
Orlando Sequera: Do we need to update any other rules because there have there have been changes in in.

1964
03:31:57.810 --> 03:31:59.849
Orlando Sequera: in the environment, in the team setting.

1965
03:32:00.800 --> 03:32:05.389
Orlando Sequera: If we have meeting members, have they been

1966
03:32:05.770 --> 03:32:13.610
Orlando Sequera: communicated about the team charter and the ground rules that we have to follow in order to work as a team. That's important. Okay.

1967
03:32:13.880 --> 03:32:16.550
Orlando Sequera: So remember what we said before

1968
03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:20.089
Orlando Sequera: with the Tuckman ladder. Whenever we add.

1969
03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:28.170
Orlando Sequera: whenever there's a change in the team, meaning that we have new team members a that are brought to the team.

1970
03:32:28.240 --> 03:32:34.050
Orlando Sequera: Then we reset the clock. We go back, even if we're in performing, we go back to forming.

1971
03:32:34.210 --> 03:32:38.249
Orlando Sequera: And as project managers, we have to work with the team

1972
03:32:39.100 --> 03:32:44.359
Orlando Sequera: a lot of close, and we have to to work with them closely.

1973
03:32:44.420 --> 03:32:46.429
Orlando Sequera: in order to make sure that they

1974
03:32:46.800 --> 03:32:53.650
Orlando Sequera: they get out of those 2 stages as we as possible for me, and storming as quickly as possible, and they get to at least norming

1975
03:32:53.730 --> 03:33:18.980
Orlando Sequera: in a timely manner. I remember seeing some questions in the Q. A. About is there a timeframe for to get out of the forming stage or the storming stage? No, that changes from from team to team, even within the same organization, because every project is different and and the predict teams are different. So no, there's not a a a timeframe for that. But the guidelines to

1976
03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:26.710
Orlando Sequera: as quickly as possible. We should move from from one stage to another as quickly as possible. Okay. And

1977
03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:30.550
Orlando Sequera: in the event of a rule being violated or broken.

1978
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:32.749
Orlando Sequera: we have to

1979
03:33:34.080 --> 03:33:37.150
Orlando Sequera: ensure that the right response is applied.

1980
03:33:37.370 --> 03:33:39.619
Orlando Sequera: We have to remind

1981
03:33:39.870 --> 03:33:41.660
Orlando Sequera: individuals about

1982
03:33:42.350 --> 03:33:51.579
Orlando Sequera: mutual agreements we all created. If we start seeing that someone, for example, is taking longer to answer a

1983
03:33:51.590 --> 03:34:07.669
Orlando Sequera: voice. Mails that were left, or is showing up late for meetings Remind them about the mutual agreement. Remember, we set these rules as a team. You were part of that process. So we have all of us. We have to follow this rules, but at the Pm. You have

1984
03:34:07.680 --> 03:34:16.139
Orlando Sequera: an extra, an extra step to take, which is as a servant leader. You have to be also a role model that's part of being a servant leader. So

1985
03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:21.860
Orlando Sequera: if you show up to late late to those meetings, and you don't really have

1986
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:26.299
Orlando Sequera: it's not really going to work right. So you you can ask

1987
03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:44.639
Orlando Sequera: for for something that you are not fulfilling or following. So you have to be early, for the meetings. Follow these rules. Be a role model. That's contagious, that it's gonna they? They're going to be paying close attention to your behavior. So you gotta watch that. I'll act

1988
03:34:44.650 --> 03:34:49.180
Orlando Sequera: accordingly at all times. Okay, the team members are watching. So

1989
03:34:49.240 --> 03:34:52.360
Orlando Sequera: if it also it's about coaching.

1990
03:34:52.500 --> 03:35:00.829
Orlando Sequera: talking to them, understanding why, what's going on? Why are they showing up showing up late for for meetings all the time. Right? So

1991
03:35:01.090 --> 03:35:04.650
Orlando Sequera: talk to them, coach them. You serve a leadership.

1992
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:08.239
Orlando Sequera: Listen to them, but in some cases.

1993
03:35:08.330 --> 03:35:15.380
Orlando Sequera: and I remember seeing some questions about that. What do we do if we have an extremely disruptive team member that is

1994
03:35:17.120 --> 03:35:36.650
Orlando Sequera: violating fl flagrantly. These ground rules, then, in that event. If, then you can, then sanctions can, can can be the super. Many actions can be used. Usually you work with the Hr Department if it gets to that point it can happen hopefully. It's not something common.

1995
03:35:36.660 --> 03:35:50.389
Orlando Sequera: A. But if any, If you have any severe violation that has to be addressed with the help of the Hr department. But that's so. Not with project management. That's something else. Okay. So

1996
03:35:50.450 --> 03:35:54.940
Orlando Sequera: a also working in leading the team, we can use

1997
03:35:55.460 --> 03:35:57.539
Orlando Sequera: rewards on recognition.

1998
03:35:57.660 --> 03:36:06.010
Orlando Sequera: and you might be wondering, is it the same? Isn't it the same rewards and recreation. Nope. They usually come hand in hand, but they're not the same.

1999
03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:09.459
Orlando Sequera: A reward is something tangible.

2000
03:36:09.570 --> 03:36:11.559
Orlando Sequera: It can be something monetary

2001
03:36:11.730 --> 03:36:28.080
Orlando Sequera: can be a gift card, or it can be even more. In some cases it this changes from organization to organization and from industry to industry. You have to make sure that you then again check your opa for your organization.

2002
03:36:28.090 --> 03:36:46.450
Orlando Sequera: If they have a reward and recognition plan in place, there might be some awards. A that you can they? They can help you with that. It changes but the goal of using every word to make recognition system is to motivate the team. Okay, it could include, as I said, monetary gifts.

2003
03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:51.520
Orlando Sequera: a additional vacation time or other, Perks or

2004
03:36:51.540 --> 03:36:59.600
Orlando Sequera: a trophy or a small gift, so something tangible. That's a reward that's a reward. The goal is to

2005
03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:01.119
Orlando Sequera: a motivate.

2006
03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:02.369
Orlando Sequera: I

2007
03:37:02.510 --> 03:37:03.340
Orlando Sequera: good

2008
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:08.529
Orlando Sequera: and any never, never, never reward

2009
03:37:08.890 --> 03:37:14.279
Orlando Sequera: without giving the proper recognition to the individual

2010
03:37:14.440 --> 03:37:19.560
Orlando Sequera: and be fair when you use rewards and recreation. Okay, and

2011
03:37:20.250 --> 03:37:21.929
Orlando Sequera: this has to be Taylor.

2012
03:37:22.190 --> 03:37:27.839
Orlando Sequera: but with rewards it's always something tangible, something that

2013
03:37:28.280 --> 03:37:38.049
Orlando Sequera: it's. It's a gift card. It's a some monetary give something tangible, and it comes with also recognition. But recognition

2014
03:37:38.230 --> 03:37:39.739
Orlando Sequera: is not tangible.

2015
03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:57.749
Orlando Sequera: Recognition is usually free. By the way, you can provide recognition, and this is an example of recognition will be, if any of your team members, and this is something that you have to do as a project manager, any of your team members they solve a major challenge that

2016
03:37:57.770 --> 03:38:11.100
Orlando Sequera: is going to help not only the project, but something that can be used for other projects. A major breakthrough, a major, something big in your project happen. Make sure that the world knows

2017
03:38:11.220 --> 03:38:22.890
Orlando Sequera: you are the number one chair leader for your team. You have to let your stakeholders know your sponsor and all the entire organization. Why not? That's what we mean by recognition. It's something intangible.

2018
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:28.360
Orlando Sequera: and it is acknowledging the behavior rather than the outcome, and

2019
03:38:28.980 --> 03:38:31.800
Orlando Sequera: it can be given without a reward, and

2020
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:36.059
Orlando Sequera: is usually free. So this is something that we can do

2021
03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:53.230
Orlando Sequera: A, and we should, and we have to do it also in a timely manner. When it happens, do not wait at the end of the project. No; give recognition when it is to be given. It's a timely. It take take into account the timing it has to be done. Excuse me.

2022
03:38:53.570 --> 03:39:04.689
Orlando Sequera: has to be done when in, when it needs to happen right. When the the the performance or the achievement has occurred. That's one needs to be given. It has to be done in a timely matter. Do not wait.

2023
03:39:04.890 --> 03:39:05.810
Orlando Sequera: also

2024
03:39:06.020 --> 03:39:11.540
Orlando Sequera: be transparent and used proper judgment when it comes to using rewards and recognition.

2025
03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:12.520
Orlando Sequera: a

2026
03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:23.539
Orlando Sequera: pay, close attention for any negative effects resulting for misplace, competitiveness, or animosity, so we be be cognizant of that so

2027
03:39:23.980 --> 03:39:29.440
Orlando Sequera: careful. Use your best judgment. But this really helps in motivating the team.

2028
03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:37.350
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to a super important aspect of project management.

2029
03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:40.579
Orlando Sequera: any project with any project, regardless of the approach.

2030
03:39:41.010 --> 03:39:44.919
Orlando Sequera: the decision-making aspect. It's about making decisions.

2031
03:39:46.010 --> 03:39:49.670
Orlando Sequera: The team charter we also created a team charter, because it's gonna help us

2032
03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:54.899
Orlando Sequera: with defining how we're going to make the decisions, and it's also going to establish.

2033
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:55.820
Orlando Sequera: They

2034
03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:00.679
Orlando Sequera: escalation path for conflict resolution, super important

2035
03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:06.820
Orlando Sequera: the goal should be with teams to always try to achieve consensus. That means that we are all

2036
03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:08.940
Orlando Sequera: on the same page.

2037
03:40:10.410 --> 03:40:11.319
Orlando Sequera: It's a

2038
03:40:11.350 --> 03:40:16.270
Orlando Sequera: consensus, a group decision technique in which the team agrees to support

2039
03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:17.619
Orlando Sequera: the outcome.

2040
03:40:17.660 --> 03:40:20.679
Orlando Sequera: We are in favor of it, even if we individually

2041
03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:24.580
Orlando Sequera: do not agree with that decision. But we still going to support it?

2042
03:40:24.700 --> 03:40:25.390
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2043
03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:32.169
Orlando Sequera: the goal should be to achieve consensus as much as possible. Is it always going to happen? No.

2044
03:40:32.260 --> 03:40:36.480
Orlando Sequera: But we should try to seek consensus as much as possible

2045
03:40:39.740 --> 03:40:41.300
Orlando Sequera: him.

2046
03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:49.170
Orlando Sequera: And these are some examples in which the decision making process and empowering the team when it comes to

2047
03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:54.090
Orlando Sequera: prioritizing requirements. Anything related to

2048
03:40:54.570 --> 03:41:04.159
Orlando Sequera: the scope of the project You got to get the team involved. They're the ones doing the work regardless of the approach. They're the ones doing the the work, so get them involved

2049
03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:09.300
Orlando Sequera: and in agile. It's a must. It's a self-organized cell cell phone.

2050
03:41:09.810 --> 03:41:11.799
Orlando Sequera: manage our team.

2051
03:41:11.850 --> 03:41:30.249
Orlando Sequera: put even in predictive. The the paradigm is shifting, so we gotta get them more involved. Empower the team to make those decisions, or when we're trying to split requirements into tasks. The team should be involved. They're the ones doing the work that or in the estimation effort that's a most for

2052
03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:31.350
Orlando Sequera: agile.

2053
03:41:31.410 --> 03:41:35.210
Orlando Sequera: They are people that are doing the work. They are the ones doing the estimation

2054
03:41:35.340 --> 03:41:36.709
Orlando Sequera: in predictive.

2055
03:41:37.050 --> 03:41:41.459
Orlando Sequera: Their recommendation is to get them involved at least, but actually

2056
03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:51.799
Orlando Sequera: let them do the estimation as much as possible. They're the ones that are the most familiar with the work, and also when it comes to risks again, the people that are doing the work.

2057
03:41:52.210 --> 03:42:01.360
Orlando Sequera: They are your best source of knowledge. With that expertise. They have been there before. Chances are they have been there before. They have worked in similar projects, and they have

2058
03:42:01.450 --> 03:42:16.920
Orlando Sequera: that knowledge that we don't have as project managers. We're not doing the work that's not what we're doing. We're not. We're leaving the team. We're helping the project in other ways, but the people are doing the work can help us better when it comes to the responses.

2059
03:42:17.230 --> 03:42:21.970
Orlando Sequera: coming up with the best responses for those risks and also with risk classification.

2060
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.940
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

2061
03:42:23.070 --> 03:42:24.540
Orlando Sequera: the goal here is to

2062
03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:30.630
Orlando Sequera: as the best practice practice to involve the team in the decision making process as much as possible.

2063
03:42:31.680 --> 03:42:33.690
Orlando Sequera: How can we make decisions?

2064
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:35.890
Orlando Sequera: We have multiple ways

2065
03:42:36.200 --> 03:42:37.630
Orlando Sequera: to make decisions.

2066
03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:40.840
Orlando Sequera: The first one is voting.

2067
03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:53.470
Orlando Sequera: and it's a way to factor in a lot of input before making a decision, and it gives everyone on the team an equal voice, and is preferred in many contexts

2068
03:42:53.760 --> 03:42:58.359
Orlando Sequera: voting right? So it's a collective decision making a approach.

2069
03:42:58.470 --> 03:43:05.429
Orlando Sequera: and it's used to generate, generate, classify, and prioritize pro requirements. For example, if we are a

2070
03:43:05.450 --> 03:43:07.029
Orlando Sequera: trying to define scope.

2071
03:43:07.430 --> 03:43:09.480
Orlando Sequera: We also have

2072
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:10.659
Orlando Sequera: another way of

2073
03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:13.469
Orlando Sequera: making a decision is using what is called

2074
03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:18.030
Orlando Sequera: multi criteria decision making.

2075
03:43:18.610 --> 03:43:31.040
Orlando Sequera: This involves a use of systematic analytical approaches to find the solutions a little bit more scientific, do evaluate ideas, use analysis. And this is, for example, when what we have in the

2076
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:43.410
Orlando Sequera: with risk levels, uncertainty and valuation. It's a little bit more scientific approach. We use a more analytical approach to make decisions. They're based on data right the outcome of that

2077
03:43:43.470 --> 03:43:51.219
Orlando Sequera: quantitative risk analysis, for example, under making decisions based on that, that's data driven multi criteria decision analysis.

2078
03:43:51.540 --> 03:43:53.080
Orlando Sequera: We also have

2079
03:43:53.440 --> 03:43:54.810
Orlando Sequera: a and

2080
03:43:55.370 --> 03:43:58.369
Orlando Sequera: another way of doing things. It happens sometimes

2081
03:43:58.860 --> 03:44:03.659
Orlando Sequera: autocratic decision making this is usually leadership driven

2082
03:44:03.760 --> 03:44:05.180
Orlando Sequera: based on data.

2083
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:12.640
Orlando Sequera: and it's when one team member decides for the group. It happens, it happens with some key stakeholders. Sometimes

2084
03:44:12.680 --> 03:44:19.779
Orlando Sequera: a decision has to be made to work over time that usually comes from upper management.

2085
03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:28.159
Orlando Sequera: That's what we need to do in order to address these schedule over overrun that we have currently in our project. Then

2086
03:44:28.330 --> 03:44:42.220
Orlando Sequera: autocratic decision making is gonna happen. Some, some someone has to make that decision, and it will be made in that. That's not going to be popular, but it's. But in some cases is what needs to happen so

2087
03:44:42.270 --> 03:44:45.680
Orlando Sequera: autocratic decision making. But we also have

2088
03:44:46.090 --> 03:44:47.810
Orlando Sequera: within voting.

2089
03:44:47.980 --> 03:44:52.179
Orlando Sequera: We also have multiple flavors as well.

2090
03:44:52.830 --> 03:45:01.519
Orlando Sequera: and please pay attention closely, because I. I have noticed that most people have a little bit of trouble understanding between the

2091
03:45:01.540 --> 03:45:09.419
Orlando Sequera: the the difference between majority and plurality. Okay, unanimity very simple. Everyone agrees

2092
03:45:09.620 --> 03:45:11.509
Orlando Sequera: on a single course of action.

2093
03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:13.750
Orlando Sequera: unanimous decision right before

2094
03:45:13.970 --> 03:45:26.659
Orlando Sequera: talking about a boxing match, for example, unanimous decision, and that is very useful in teams to re great cohesion. One way of achieving that unanimity is using the delivery technique. Remember that

2095
03:45:27.150 --> 03:45:28.000
a

2096
03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:31.459
Orlando Sequera: anonymous questioner that we sent

2097
03:45:31.650 --> 03:45:38.039
Orlando Sequera: to multiple times in order to reach consensus. So that's one way to reach a unanimity

2098
03:45:38.430 --> 03:45:39.640
Orlando Sequera: majority

2099
03:45:40.100 --> 03:45:41.430
Orlando Sequera: East, when

2100
03:45:41.970 --> 03:45:46.489
Orlando Sequera: the decision is more than 50% of group support.

2101
03:45:46.740 --> 03:45:48.280
Orlando Sequera: and

2102
03:45:48.370 --> 03:45:55.520
Orlando Sequera: ideally you can create groups of an uneven number of participants to ensure that decisions are made, and you avoid ties

2103
03:45:55.720 --> 03:46:01.090
Orlando Sequera: as much or trust, then it's more than 50%. But

2104
03:46:01.180 --> 03:46:01.890
Okay.

2105
03:46:02.100 --> 03:46:03.730
Orlando Sequera: variety is

2106
03:46:04.630 --> 03:46:06.630
Orlando Sequera: in situations in which

2107
03:46:06.720 --> 03:46:21.390
Orlando Sequera: the largest block in a group decides. Even if the majority is not achieved, so it doesn't have to be more than 50. If the largest block is 20 or 10%, then

2108
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:25.659
Orlando Sequera: the largest block is going to win. If we are using

2109
03:46:25.700 --> 03:46:27.530
Orlando Sequera: plurality as

2110
03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:29.030
Orlando Sequera: the

2111
03:46:29.230 --> 03:46:31.770
Orlando Sequera: as the decision making process for voting.

2112
03:46:31.960 --> 03:46:49.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay, an example of that. Not so much here in the Us. But in Europe, where you where you have multiple parties and they have. they're trying to elect the Prime Minister, for example, multiple parties, right? And alliances between those parties. Usually

2113
03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:53.520
Orlando Sequera: it the largest block is going to be the one that wins.

2114
03:46:53.600 --> 03:47:06.099
Orlando Sequera: Okay, put those largest blocks. They not necessarily gonna have more than 50. They can win an election with 2030%, etc., so that'll be an example of

2115
03:47:07.160 --> 03:47:09.469
Orlando Sequera: for a

2116
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:12.589
Orlando Sequera: for adjunct projects and hybrid.

2117
03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:18.350
Orlando Sequera: You have voting methods, and this that we see here

2118
03:47:18.440 --> 03:47:22.329
Orlando Sequera: in the far right. I'm mostly used in agile

2119
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:28.119
Orlando Sequera: this to 5 when you try to a and it's it's very simple. So

2120
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:35.649
Orlando Sequera: closest you are in this agreement.

2121
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:47.509
Orlando Sequera: and then, if you are neutral, will be a 3 3 fingers. That's the fifth of 5 to express a support, or it's that you're in favor, or you are against

2122
03:47:47.720 --> 03:47:57.659
Orlando Sequera: planning poker is another type of voting we that's used for estimation. A. When we, using the Fibonacci series and try to estimate the

2123
03:47:57.830 --> 03:48:00.920
Orlando Sequera: the number, the complexity of the User stories.

2124
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:15.599
Orlando Sequera: Then we use the Fibonacci. We use the deck of cards with the Fibonacci series and the highest number. It's going to be more complex. They they lower numbers going to be less complex, and we read out loud the user stories.

2125
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:18.409
Orlando Sequera: and then we give a chance

2126
03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:27.039
Orlando Sequera: to the developers to the people who are doing the work to vote, and they show their car based on what they think the level of complexity is going to be.

2127
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:39.480
Orlando Sequera: There's also another dot voting to that's widely used when you're trying to determine which requirements Have the higher priority. It's putting more more dots on those requirements with your stakeholders.

2128
03:48:39.610 --> 03:48:42.209
Orlando Sequera: Roman voting. Very simple to understand.

2129
03:48:42.850 --> 03:48:44.739
Orlando Sequera: I'm in favor i'm against

2130
03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:46.139
Orlando Sequera: i'm neutral

2131
03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:47.789
Orlando Sequera: and polling

2132
03:48:48.150 --> 03:48:50.680
Orlando Sequera: so multiple decision making

2133
03:48:50.940 --> 03:48:53.640
Orlando Sequera: a method that you have when it comes to

2134
03:48:53.670 --> 03:48:54.590
Orlando Sequera: voting.

2135
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:06.670
Orlando Sequera: We also have one aspect, and this goes back to transparency of the work that we were doing.

2136
03:49:07.380 --> 03:49:08.969
Orlando Sequera: This is crucial

2137
03:49:09.440 --> 03:49:11.570
Orlando Sequera: for any project

2138
03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:13.829
Orlando Sequera: we have to

2139
03:49:14.450 --> 03:49:16.869
Orlando Sequera: A, we have to be able.

2140
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:21.390
Orlando Sequera: we have to understand, and this is part of the ethical component.

2141
03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:40.320
Orlando Sequera: The work that we do has to be available for anyone that needs information. We're not hiding anything. Okay, and remember that also for the exam. And even for your your daily practices. As a project manager. We have to be transparent with the way with the work we are doing.

2142
03:49:40.380 --> 03:49:42.419
Orlando Sequera: We should keep the work

2143
03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:43.770
Orlando Sequera: visible.

2144
03:49:44.140 --> 03:49:46.780
Orlando Sequera: A. And that means

2145
03:49:47.170 --> 03:49:49.580
Orlando Sequera: if we're following a predictive approach.

2146
03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:51.990
Orlando Sequera: We have to have our

2147
03:49:52.660 --> 03:49:59.840
Orlando Sequera: Wbs available and show and be able to show project progress to anyone that

2148
03:49:59.890 --> 03:50:03.930
Orlando Sequera: asks that question. And we also need to have

2149
03:50:04.050 --> 03:50:09.359
Orlando Sequera: our racy charts available to show the roles and responsibilities.

2150
03:50:10.260 --> 03:50:22.439
Orlando Sequera: We're not having anything we're not hiding anything. If anything, we if we start to to have challenges. It's actually the opposite. If we start to encounter challenges which we're going to encounter because no project goes

2151
03:50:22.690 --> 03:50:28.709
Orlando Sequera: according to plan. I heard a 100. It's like a military operation, never goes according to plan. Then

2152
03:50:29.150 --> 03:50:47.939
Orlando Sequera: we need to ask for help, and but we need to do it before we get before. The problem is unbearable. We're going to start seeing some signs. That's what we do with project managers. We have to ask for help. So that means building. That's why we work so hard and building the trust with those stakeholders.

2153
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:51.340
Orlando Sequera: Because when problems happen, if we have been able to build

2154
03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:56.039
Orlando Sequera: trust. When we have to get bad news, it's going to be totally different

2155
03:50:56.100 --> 03:50:58.109
Orlando Sequera: if if we keep them in for.

2156
03:50:58.330 --> 03:51:03.009
Orlando Sequera: and they they keep a full speed of the project compared to

2157
03:51:03.260 --> 03:51:17.059
Orlando Sequera: having you as a project manager to tell them for 3 months that everything is going great. But all of a sudden oh, but we are we? We miss the key deliverable, or we are severely.

2158
03:51:17.620 --> 03:51:33.729
Orlando Sequera: we have a severe cost overrun right? So we're in the basis of avoiding some prices we have to build for us, and that goes with transparency. Keep everything we're not having anything from anybody, any. Keep your artifacts up to date.

2159
03:51:33.740 --> 03:51:42.550
Orlando Sequera: Keep your information available, and the same principle is applicable to agile. This is a little example of what I mean of

2160
03:51:42.910 --> 03:51:49.429
Orlando Sequera: an actual information radiator. In this case it's a Camden board, but it shows

2161
03:51:49.780 --> 03:51:59.420
Orlando Sequera: the different columns. In this case we have the To-do list what needs to be done what is in work in the last colonies. What needs

2162
03:51:59.480 --> 03:52:04.619
Orlando Sequera: what is what is being worked right now? And the last column that we see here is

2163
03:52:04.700 --> 03:52:10.949
Orlando Sequera: what is completed or done. Okay. So keep that visible available.

2164
03:52:11.240 --> 03:52:21.180
Orlando Sequera: and anybody has any questions feel free to to provide the information. So you're not. You're not hiding anything from anybody that is part of being transparent.

2165
03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:22.010
Okay.

2166
03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:25.989
Orlando Sequera: all right. So we have covered

2167
03:52:26.250 --> 03:52:39.040
Orlando Sequera: the a few topics about leading a team supporting diversity and inclusion. This is how it relates to the Exam Content outline. And then we talked about inspired, motivating and influencing the team members and stakeholders.

2168
03:52:39.940 --> 03:52:42.639
Orlando Sequera: We talked about the re

2169
03:52:42.850 --> 03:52:51.770
Orlando Sequera: recognition and reward system, and we also have to the importance of empowering your team members and stakeholders and the ways of

2170
03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:52.890
Orlando Sequera: a

2171
03:52:53.070 --> 03:52:54.530
Orlando Sequera: making of this issue.

2172
03:52:56.370 --> 03:52:58.249
Orlando Sequera: The next topic

2173
03:52:58.630 --> 03:53:05.200
Orlando Sequera: is going to be supporting members. I would like to take the time and review

2174
03:53:07.230 --> 03:53:12.170
Orlando Sequera: the Q. And a. For any content related questions and

2175
03:53:20.240 --> 03:53:25.320
Orlando Sequera: a question in the chat. How do you manage language barriers within teams?

2176
03:53:25.730 --> 03:53:31.139
Orlando Sequera: if i'm understanding correctly, you mean different languages. Well.

2177
03:53:32.380 --> 03:53:36.710
Orlando Sequera: ideally, there is one language that your

2178
03:53:36.790 --> 03:53:44.529
Orlando Sequera: team members can communicate. They're all speak one particular language ideally, that's the case.

2179
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:47.390
Orlando Sequera: But try to be

2180
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:55.000
Orlando Sequera: sensitive and try to understand it goes back to respect. Right. Try to understand

2181
03:53:55.330 --> 03:53:59.429
Orlando Sequera: a the cultural differences with other

2182
03:53:59.900 --> 03:54:11.450
Orlando Sequera: team members that in which, because maybe in your culture, is something that external might be, might not be the case in a different culture. So, first of all, ideally, there's one language that

2183
03:54:11.700 --> 03:54:27.310
Orlando Sequera: that you all can communicate and use. That will be ideal. I don't see I don't see it working any other way. But I think the question is more along the the the lines of respect different cultures. It's about respect, inclusion

2184
03:54:27.320 --> 03:54:32.389
Orlando Sequera: and using diversity as a strength. If If I understand the correctly, that is.

2185
03:54:32.940 --> 03:54:34.650
Orlando Sequera: okay.

2186
03:54:36.160 --> 03:54:38.359
Orlando Sequera: that the team go.

2187
03:54:40.230 --> 03:54:42.640
Orlando Sequera: There's another question in the Q. A.

2188
03:54:44.380 --> 03:54:49.629
Orlando Sequera: That's a team. Go through the forming stage. If someone leaves, for no new members are added.

2189
03:54:49.920 --> 03:54:55.000
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily. No, it's. Usually when someone new is is change, although

2190
03:54:55.970 --> 03:55:00.239
Orlando Sequera: it is a change. But you still have. The people that already went through

2191
03:55:00.350 --> 03:55:04.329
Orlando Sequera: is really i'm gonna this is gonna sound a.

2192
03:55:05.440 --> 03:55:14.509
Orlando Sequera: It really depends on what that person was doing, because in my it's gonna have an impact on the workload for the rest of the team members. So

2193
03:55:14.530 --> 03:55:19.129
Orlando Sequera: it depends on the situation in some cases. Yes, in some cases no

2194
03:55:22.480 --> 03:55:23.320
Orlando Sequera: right

2195
03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:31.300
Orlando Sequera: Is the Mcgregor theory X and theory. Why applicable to agile approach? Absolutely. Yes.

2196
03:55:32.580 --> 03:55:34.400
Orlando Sequera: to personally surveys.

2197
03:55:35.430 --> 03:55:36.260
Orlando Sequera: Hello!

2198
03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:40.590
Orlando Sequera: Form the team like Meyer Bricks. Absolutely. Yes.

2199
03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:44.199
Orlando Sequera: yes, that can give you an idea

2200
03:55:44.250 --> 03:55:48.169
Orlando Sequera: absolutely. Myer Bricks is used by many organizations. Yes.

2201
03:55:48.930 --> 03:55:59.319
Orlando Sequera: another question on ground rules. How do you manage consequences for those who repeatedly break them, even with intervention being late to meetings not invite into work, times, etc.,

2202
03:55:59.380 --> 03:56:01.300
Orlando Sequera: If it's a repeated offender.

2203
03:56:02.410 --> 03:56:20.759
Orlando Sequera: be proactive, try to understand. Give them the benefit of it out. Let's start with that. Try to understand. Why are they doing that. But if you address it in a private setting with them and they continue to do it, then you're gonna have to escalate that, and and possible sanctions are going to be

2204
03:56:20.770 --> 03:56:27.189
Orlando Sequera: a are going to be needed ideally in a professional environment. People shouldn't behave like that, but it happens

2205
03:56:27.270 --> 03:56:28.060
Orlando Sequera: but

2206
03:56:28.580 --> 03:56:30.650
Orlando Sequera: right and and document

2207
03:56:30.760 --> 03:56:38.539
Orlando Sequera: your steps as well. Document what you do when it comes to that. So if it's not working, then you might need to

2208
03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:43.229
Orlando Sequera: You might need to

2209
03:56:44.660 --> 03:56:47.150
Orlando Sequera: actually get Hr: involved.

2210
03:56:48.140 --> 03:56:50.070
Orlando Sequera: there's another question.

2211
03:56:50.290 --> 03:56:56.560
Orlando Sequera: What would you say to the team when you have to take a decision with our their consensus?

2212
03:56:59.680 --> 03:57:01.939
Orlando Sequera: It's usually got.

2213
03:57:01.970 --> 03:57:03.340
Orlando Sequera: That's a good question.

2214
03:57:04.020 --> 03:57:05.690
Orlando Sequera: The answer to that.

2215
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:09.839
Orlando Sequera: Those type of decisions usually are going to come from upper management

2216
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:11.330
Orlando Sequera: from upper management.

2217
03:57:11.450 --> 03:57:19.739
Orlando Sequera: Someone in that with a high level of authority is gonna have to make that decision. Remember that your level of authority, right as a project manager so

2218
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:23.370
Orlando Sequera: try to work with the team

2219
03:57:23.620 --> 03:57:28.409
Orlando Sequera: what I I've been in that situation before. As a project manager, my recommendation will be.

2220
03:57:28.880 --> 03:57:37.859
Orlando Sequera: Try to work with them, so they, even though it is an unpopular situation and popular decision. Try to work with them in.

2221
03:57:38.540 --> 03:57:47.160
Orlando Sequera: make sure that they understand the benefits of that decision to the project. Work on, remind them of the project vision, and

2222
03:57:47.390 --> 03:58:05.419
Orlando Sequera: let them know about the benefits that come with that. It might be unpopular at this time, but it's better to do it now. Work over time this weekend, rather than having to do it at the end of the project for for multiple weeks we should do it now, then, do it later, so remind them of the benefits that come with a decision as

2223
03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:10.920
Orlando Sequera: as the as a servant leader, I would say, that's my best advice on that situation

2224
03:58:11.220 --> 03:58:12.680
Orlando Sequera: and

2225
03:58:15.080 --> 03:58:26.330
Orlando Sequera: decision making and consensus or 2 ends of the spectrum, and they not necessarily consensus is one way to make a decision, the ideal one. But it's not always possible, though

2226
03:58:27.470 --> 03:58:37.949
Orlando Sequera: it's not always going to be possible. It is ideally, and recommended another question in a situation where a Pm. Has a small group. By that I mean a small team, I think.

2227
03:58:38.030 --> 03:58:44.809
Orlando Sequera: one of which is a top performer and talented. How do you temper with great creativity comes

2228
03:58:44.900 --> 03:58:46.910
Orlando Sequera: great.

2229
03:58:48.190 --> 03:58:49.130
Orlando Sequera: Come.

2230
03:58:50.440 --> 03:58:54.360
Orlando Sequera: with great creativity comes great

2231
03:58:55.090 --> 03:59:02.289
Orlando Sequera: responsibility. I think, as this in video believes that all all the the bills are in fear. Oh, okay, I see where this question is going.

2232
03:59:03.160 --> 03:59:05.550
Orlando Sequera: Nope. Remind them of

2233
03:59:05.800 --> 03:59:06.730
Orlando Sequera: they

2234
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:10.350
Orlando Sequera: The fact that it is is all about the team.

2235
03:59:10.930 --> 03:59:12.939
Orlando Sequera: There is no I in team.

2236
03:59:13.650 --> 03:59:20.730
Orlando Sequera: It's about the team. It's not about the individual, and for make sure that you do that not only with that person you do that with everyone.

2237
03:59:21.020 --> 03:59:26.120
Orlando Sequera: They, the stakeholders, are looking at the team. They're not looking at the individual, so

2238
03:59:26.330 --> 03:59:40.860
Orlando Sequera: remind them of that. It's about individual commitment. It's not about individual commitment. It's about a team commitment, and we have to work it's it's a team. There's no I in team. Okay, so you have to work on making sure that not only that individual.

2239
03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:49.139
Orlando Sequera: that also everyone understands, that is, everything is about the team, not about the individual. A. And because

2240
03:59:49.920 --> 04:00:01.499
Orlando Sequera: I. If if that was the case that people will be working by himself or herself right there's a reason why he needs to he or she. They need to work with other people, so re reinforce the message of

2241
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:04.459
Orlando Sequera: the team teamwork.

2242
04:00:05.930 --> 04:00:10.070
Orlando Sequera: hey? Will any of these team techniques

2243
04:00:10.260 --> 04:00:16.260
Orlando Sequera: differ when working a unit? Environment. No, they should have nothing to do with Union considerations.

2244
04:00:17.240 --> 04:00:20.379
Orlando Sequera: No team performance is Nope.

2245
04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:23.889
Orlando Sequera: A going along with

2246
04:00:23.960 --> 04:00:27.940
Orlando Sequera: the leadership managing teams. How difficult it is

2247
04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:32.870
Orlando Sequera: to lead a project in a field. You aren't familiar with it's more challenging.

2248
04:00:33.740 --> 04:00:50.920
Orlando Sequera: It's more challenging. There are definitely in school. There are different schools of thought when it comes to that. Some organizations believe that someone that has experience in the field makes a better project manager. Some other organizations Not necessarily. And I've seen it both ways. I've seen great project managers

2249
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:55.279
Orlando Sequera: that came from marketing, and they started working in it.

2250
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:57.139
Orlando Sequera: and they do great.

2251
04:00:57.450 --> 04:01:05.520
Orlando Sequera: and I've seen the opposite, too, so they're not necessarily mutually exclusive. A project management as a science is working with people.

2252
04:01:06.480 --> 04:01:24.370
Orlando Sequera: and if you can work well with people and lead a team and be successful and keep everything coordinated and organize. You're going to be successfully in any industry, and the beauty of this techniques that we're using here. Learning is that this is applicable to any industry. This is not industry specific. This is industry neutral.

2253
04:01:30.180 --> 04:01:31.890
Orlando Sequera: okay.

2254
04:01:32.760 --> 04:01:36.460
Orlando Sequera: Which approach to managing a project will be the most effective

2255
04:01:36.760 --> 04:01:48.449
Orlando Sequera: outsource internally manage. It depends on this. Well, you're given the answer at the end. It really depends on your situation. You gotta take a look into account your specific context within your organization.

2256
04:01:50.290 --> 04:01:51.619
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2257
04:01:54.170 --> 04:02:00.389
Orlando Sequera: is data the only key driver in decision making methods. No, not necessarily. But it's an important one, but it's not the only one.

2258
04:02:05.380 --> 04:02:06.520
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2259
04:02:11.850 --> 04:02:23.950
Orlando Sequera: Have you seen auto product styling, voting absolutely many times, as I mentioned before, when the as a session is made that we have to work over time on the weekend. Yes, multiple times. It happens all the time.

2260
04:02:29.230 --> 04:02:34.140
Orlando Sequera: all right. Myers Breaks can assist when determining type of skills

2261
04:02:34.490 --> 04:02:48.630
Orlando Sequera: one has and can increase a motion in 10 years with leadership. This can be helpful in building teams to stormy, normally forming, as discussed in our class earlier, but it's not on the Pmp. Test. It's not mentioned, but absolutely so. That's a true statement. Yes.

2262
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:53.900
Orlando Sequera: okay. So I think we have

2263
04:02:54.130 --> 04:02:56.649
Orlando Sequera: address. the questions.

2264
04:02:57.740 --> 04:02:59.239
Orlando Sequera: Let's go in and continue

2265
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:08.150
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to support the team member performance.

2266
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:12.570
Orlando Sequera: Managing and lead right.

2267
04:03:14.500 --> 04:03:16.159
Orlando Sequera: Teams are

2268
04:03:16.490 --> 04:03:25.799
Orlando Sequera: in most cases more productive and driven when they know exactly where they're going. When they have clear objectives to meet

2269
04:03:26.640 --> 04:03:28.180
Orlando Sequera: project managers

2270
04:03:28.570 --> 04:03:35.389
Orlando Sequera: project Managers can support the team by setting these objectives collaboratively with the team.

2271
04:03:36.380 --> 04:03:37.780
Orlando Sequera: One approach

2272
04:03:37.950 --> 04:03:43.590
Orlando Sequera: that we use for that is something that is called Mbo, or management by objectives

2273
04:03:43.960 --> 04:03:45.250
Orlando Sequera: to help with that

2274
04:03:45.600 --> 04:03:50.169
Orlando Sequera: the objective setting can be conducted at the start of the project or face.

2275
04:03:50.230 --> 04:03:53.700
Orlando Sequera: but it's normally done throughout the project. Life cycle

2276
04:03:53.760 --> 04:03:55.039
Orlando Sequera: A.

2277
04:03:55.380 --> 04:03:59.240
Orlando Sequera: Even regardless of the approach in agile or predictive.

2278
04:03:59.400 --> 04:04:06.640
Orlando Sequera: and that helps to set the targets and commitments for the upcoming time period. Okay, so

2279
04:04:07.440 --> 04:04:08.850
Orlando Sequera: clear objectives

2280
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:13.430
Orlando Sequera: that helps the team set set those objectives with the team

2281
04:04:13.450 --> 04:04:17.749
Orlando Sequera: create objectives that are challenging, but realistically possible.

2282
04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:19.969
Orlando Sequera: And this can be done

2283
04:04:20.040 --> 04:04:25.240
Orlando Sequera: if we're following a predictive approach, it's going to be the to start the project or face.

2284
04:04:25.260 --> 04:04:33.059
Orlando Sequera: or throughout the project life cycle. If we're following an adaptive approach or agile, okay. And as servant leaders.

2285
04:04:33.610 --> 04:04:41.259
Orlando Sequera: we have to help in defining the vision, making sure that people are aligned to that vision, and then

2286
04:04:41.500 --> 04:04:45.619
Orlando Sequera: super important, we motivate people to pursue the vision.

2287
04:04:45.780 --> 04:04:49.379
Orlando Sequera: So that's one way that we can help teams with product activities

2288
04:04:53.050 --> 04:04:54.629
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2289
04:04:55.870 --> 04:05:02.440
Orlando Sequera: measuring the team member performance. Remember, this is not. In in most cases

2290
04:05:02.520 --> 04:05:19.280
Orlando Sequera: our team members are not going to be our direct report. So we're talking about project performance, right? So we're assessing this. This is not their Yearly review evaluation. We're assessing the team member performance. That's what we're doing here. And

2291
04:05:19.350 --> 04:05:24.780
Orlando Sequera: in regards to the project task and we can what or the project work

2292
04:05:25.050 --> 04:05:36.389
Orlando Sequera: we can use in for formal, informal assessments, and and not with a punitive approach or connotation. Right? What we're trying to understand here is.

2293
04:05:36.400 --> 04:05:59.259
Orlando Sequera: how can we help them? As as a server leaders that we are. How can we help them to improve? That's what we're doing. The second bullet point that you see here discover a produce for improvement. That's why we're doing this. We're not trying to evaluate a poor performance and come up with a separate sessions. No, that that's a different arena. That's the functional manager that is doing that. We are trying to

2294
04:05:59.340 --> 04:06:01.489
Orlando Sequera: assess their performance

2295
04:06:01.960 --> 04:06:08.199
Orlando Sequera: to find ways to help them to improve. That's that's it. To help them to to improve

2296
04:06:08.250 --> 04:06:09.250
Orlando Sequera: a

2297
04:06:09.280 --> 04:06:10.590
Orlando Sequera: agile teams.

2298
04:06:11.610 --> 04:06:26.649
Orlando Sequera: They are self-organized, and we need to make sure that they have a safe environment that can help them with their performance and make sure that's our main goal. To make sure they feel a safe, and they have that safe environment for them to express

2299
04:06:26.770 --> 04:06:34.869
Orlando Sequera: to regulate their own performance by by feeling safe and reinforce. That message that I just mentioned

2300
04:06:35.060 --> 04:06:45.069
Orlando Sequera: is about the team reinforced a message. If they focus on the commitment. It's about. It's a team commitment. It's not an individual commitment. Okay.

2301
04:06:45.840 --> 04:06:47.949
Orlando Sequera: And when it comes to

2302
04:06:48.770 --> 04:06:54.690
Orlando Sequera: performance assessment tasks, we should compare the performance to the goals that we set.

2303
04:06:55.330 --> 04:06:57.090
Orlando Sequera: We should also.

2304
04:06:57.580 --> 04:06:59.549
Orlando Sequera: even though we created

2305
04:06:59.860 --> 04:07:00.710
Orlando Sequera: they

2306
04:07:00.930 --> 04:07:04.869
Orlando Sequera: actual racing matrix, we should re-clarify

2307
04:07:05.170 --> 04:07:11.050
Orlando Sequera: they grow some responsibilities. That's why we create those artifacts to use them when needed.

2308
04:07:11.170 --> 04:07:12.780
Orlando Sequera: And this is one example

2309
04:07:13.530 --> 04:07:18.690
Orlando Sequera: we might need to require for rural responsibilities, and that's usually one of the common causes

2310
04:07:18.990 --> 04:07:20.240
Orlando Sequera: or conflict.

2311
04:07:21.200 --> 04:07:24.130
Orlando Sequera: We should be able to provide positive

2312
04:07:24.340 --> 04:07:25.260
Orlando Sequera: and

2313
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:29.509
Orlando Sequera: as well as negative feedback voting a constructive way.

2314
04:07:29.770 --> 04:07:33.859
Orlando Sequera: we should try to discover unknown and not resolve issues, and

2315
04:07:34.410 --> 04:07:42.680
Orlando Sequera: in some cases create. They might need some training and create some individual training plans and try to set future growth. So

2316
04:07:42.840 --> 04:07:47.270
Orlando Sequera: we're talking about the performance in regards to the project. Work.

2317
04:07:48.780 --> 04:07:50.500
Orlando Sequera: hey?

2318
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:52.010
Orlando Sequera: Also

2319
04:07:52.850 --> 04:07:56.670
Orlando Sequera: some of you were mentioning, and this is where

2320
04:07:56.950 --> 04:08:05.140
Orlando Sequera: some of it came up the personality indicators, and I know that some of you were mentioning Myers Bricks. That really helps to understand

2321
04:08:05.170 --> 04:08:09.689
Orlando Sequera: the type of person that different type of personalities, so

2322
04:08:10.140 --> 04:08:16.469
Orlando Sequera: many organizations. They use personality test that, like Myers breaks abuse. I've done it multiple times.

2323
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:19.089
Orlando Sequera: and they help

2324
04:08:19.970 --> 04:08:29.090
Orlando Sequera: to understand the different personalities that you're working with, and that can be a good behavioral predictor, for

2325
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:39.790
Orlando Sequera: there's a big caveat, right? It's not always a 100% the case. So keep that a keep that caveat in mind. That is not always 100% an absolute

2326
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:40.530
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

2327
04:08:40.650 --> 04:08:42.369
Orlando Sequera: And

2328
04:08:42.530 --> 04:09:00.420
Orlando Sequera: if you're using this and other aspect is right to a sick permission from the team members and explain why you're using it because they may. Why is the Pm. Wanting to get at this evaluation or or a Myers breaks type of indicator. So

2329
04:09:00.430 --> 04:09:10.839
Orlando Sequera: So okay, let them know. Remember, we're transparent. It's it's all about the team. We have nothing to we have nothing to hide, so they can be helpful

2330
04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:21.289
Orlando Sequera: because they can encourage a team to achieve an aspire as professionals. It can help with building interactions, build trust and empower team members by aligning their strengths

2331
04:09:21.310 --> 04:09:24.330
Orlando Sequera: with knowledge, sharing, and coaching role.

2332
04:09:24.400 --> 04:09:28.540
Orlando Sequera: But we have some do. Some don's with those personal indicators

2333
04:09:28.740 --> 04:09:31.440
Orlando Sequera: use the exercise as a way

2334
04:09:31.730 --> 04:09:46.279
Orlando Sequera: for a team building activity. So some of you were asking about example of a team builder activity. This could be an example, you said as a predictor, as I mentioned, not as an absolute right so big caveat in there, and always ask for permission. But

2335
04:09:46.430 --> 04:10:00.910
Orlando Sequera: they don't they some of the don't is don't make fix assumptions based on the Myers bricks. Result: it's not 100% bulletproof and do not share any personal information by no means with anyone without having permission.

2336
04:10:00.970 --> 04:10:06.040
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so useful, but use at your own discretion as well.

2337
04:10:06.850 --> 04:10:09.350
Orlando Sequera: and we are ready for

2338
04:10:09.820 --> 04:10:14.759
Orlando Sequera: we're break. So we're gonna take a break and we're going to.

2339
04:10:15.160 --> 04:10:18.749
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be back in 10 min. Enjoy your break

2340
04:10:19.120 --> 04:10:20.650
Orlando Sequera: will be right back.

2341
04:10:31.310 --> 04:10:34.939
Orlando Sequera: going to continue with the content. And remember this

2342
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:45.199
Orlando Sequera: personally. Indicators like Myers bricks. They're great, but they are we. We gotta keep a few things in mind when we use them.

2343
04:10:47.080 --> 04:10:48.610
Orlando Sequera: and also

2344
04:10:51.180 --> 04:10:53.690
Orlando Sequera: the whole goal of

2345
04:10:55.350 --> 04:10:58.789
Orlando Sequera: Besides this personality test like Myers bricks.

2346
04:10:59.060 --> 04:11:02.830
Orlando Sequera: So we're using what is called psychometrics.

2347
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:08.320
Orlando Sequera: They're great. You can adjust them within the team to the emotional.

2348
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:12.019
Orlando Sequera: A and other needs of the team members and key break stakeholders.

2349
04:11:12.060 --> 04:11:26.069
Orlando Sequera: Because you may wonder. Why do we want to use those personal indicators? Because they can personally is gonna have an impact on the role that you have within the team. How do you interact with other people, and whether your core values

2350
04:11:26.250 --> 04:11:32.290
Orlando Sequera: align with the teams core values that go to it's a good indicator. But

2351
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:44.089
Orlando Sequera: Remember some of the psychological team Rolls are results oriented. Some people are results oriented. They some other people are more relationship focused.

2352
04:11:44.120 --> 04:12:01.899
Orlando Sequera: Some are more disruptive thinkers. Some people are more pragmatic. Some people are more process oriented or rule followers than other people, so that can help you to understand that a a little bit more with your team. So it's a good recommendation to use this

2353
04:12:02.180 --> 04:12:04.230
Orlando Sequera: the tools with your team.

2354
04:12:04.530 --> 04:12:06.620
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to

2355
04:12:06.820 --> 04:12:09.430
Orlando Sequera: a very important aspect

2356
04:12:09.940 --> 04:12:21.049
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to team performance and working with any team. This is very important for the Pmp. Exam, as I mentioned before, about a

2357
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:30.780
Orlando Sequera: several leadership. This is another aspect that you have to take into account for your Pmp. Exam. You should expect questions related to emotional intelligence

2358
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:36.059
Orlando Sequera: as we have learned, it's not just enough to have

2359
04:12:36.460 --> 04:12:37.380
Orlando Sequera: IQ.

2360
04:12:37.640 --> 04:12:44.600
Orlando Sequera: That is technical knowledge. We also need Eq. Emotional intelligence. So you might be wondering why

2361
04:12:45.290 --> 04:12:48.679
Orlando Sequera: i'm very smart. I should be able to work with any team

2362
04:12:48.860 --> 04:13:07.230
Orlando Sequera: because you're not working as an individual. You're working with other people, so you need to be emotionally intelligent to be able to work with other people, and that goes not just for you as the project manager, but also for the team members. Okay, this is critical, but it is important that you asked the Pm.

2363
04:13:07.240 --> 04:13:14.860
Orlando Sequera: You are able to have a high level of Eq emotional intelligence. This is going to help you to

2364
04:13:14.890 --> 04:13:22.040
Orlando Sequera: understand. The beauty of emotional intelligence is that it's going to help you to understand your own emotions.

2365
04:13:22.160 --> 04:13:24.130
Orlando Sequera: and also the emotions of

2366
04:13:24.210 --> 04:13:25.220
Orlando Sequera: a They

2367
04:13:25.450 --> 04:13:27.140
Orlando Sequera: people that are around you

2368
04:13:27.880 --> 04:13:34.099
Orlando Sequera: to in order to help to minimize conflict as much as possible, and it boils down to

2369
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:42.999
Orlando Sequera: not letting your emotions, dictate your actions or take over, Gotta keep those emotions in check.

2370
04:13:43.930 --> 04:13:45.720
Orlando Sequera: And

2371
04:13:45.920 --> 04:13:46.880
Orlando Sequera: these.

2372
04:13:47.360 --> 04:13:51.220
Orlando Sequera: just for some background. This is this is part of those

2373
04:13:51.310 --> 04:13:59.370
Orlando Sequera: They They work in the emotional intelligence, started back in the nineties, and right now it's recognized as a key.

2374
04:13:59.450 --> 04:14:03.529
Orlando Sequera: personal and in a personal scale for project management.

2375
04:14:04.560 --> 04:14:17.359
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to emotional intelligence, we have 5 components that we see here the first one being emotional self-awareness and that may that actually is referred to. How well

2376
04:14:17.490 --> 04:14:20.539
Orlando Sequera: you know your own emotions

2377
04:14:21.390 --> 04:14:23.770
Orlando Sequera: in a variety of situations.

2378
04:14:24.110 --> 04:14:28.549
Orlando Sequera: The next act, the next aspect is self-regulation.

2379
04:14:29.370 --> 04:14:32.390
Orlando Sequera: How well can you control those emotions.

2380
04:14:32.610 --> 04:14:35.430
Orlando Sequera: The next one is motivation.

2381
04:14:36.800 --> 04:14:41.520
Orlando Sequera: and that is referred to your reasons for achievement.

2382
04:14:42.480 --> 04:15:00.589
Orlando Sequera: The next aspect is empathy is, how well can you read the motions of other people, and the last one, super, important as well is social skills. How well can you build relationships, relationships, and report with other people?

2383
04:15:00.990 --> 04:15:06.610
Orlando Sequera: So 5 elements that together form emotional intelligence.

2384
04:15:07.060 --> 04:15:07.710
Orlando Sequera: And

2385
04:15:08.380 --> 04:15:10.300
Orlando Sequera: what can we do

2386
04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:18.749
Orlando Sequera: to build that emotional intelligence? What can we do to build it? Easier set than done by the way. This takes time

2387
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:26.809
Orlando Sequera: takes time, and you can apply this in any setting. But it is important that we keep those emotions and check. We're going to have

2388
04:15:26.850 --> 04:15:30.500
Orlando Sequera: situations, and we we all have blind spots.

2389
04:15:30.570 --> 04:15:32.640
Orlando Sequera: We all have biases.

2390
04:15:33.680 --> 04:15:49.359
Orlando Sequera: It's it's part of human nature. But we need to keep those emotions under control. So we start in order to build our emotional intelligence following this cycle. It's a good way. You start with social a with self-awareness.

2391
04:15:49.420 --> 04:15:52.860
Orlando Sequera: It's about a self-regulating yourself.

2392
04:15:52.900 --> 04:15:57.869
Orlando Sequera: So understanding those blind spots that you might have understanding those

2393
04:15:57.910 --> 04:16:00.970
Orlando Sequera: situations that can trigger your emotions

2394
04:16:01.270 --> 04:16:02.429
Orlando Sequera: and also

2395

2398
04:16:14.610 --> 04:16:28.050

Orlando Sequera: A.

2415
04:17:55.160 --> 04:17:57.329

2422
04:18:44.180 --> 04:18:58.209
Orlando Sequera: critical for the Pmp. Exam. Make sure that you understand it really well, should respect a few questions related to emotional intelligence. Make sure that you review it if you need additional content. This is also cover in your agile practice. Guide.

Orlando Sequera: high performing teams. If we have said before, they are good at communicating, they're good at building bonds.

2430

2433
04:19:37.660 --> 04:19:42.880
Orlando Sequera: They're able to manage conflicts. That's another topic. We're going to talk about conflict management. Indeed.

2434
04:19:43.460 --> 04:19:44.999
Orlando Sequera: a a little bit later.

2435
04:19:45.150 --> 04:19:50.950
Orlando Sequera: huge topic for the exam as well, and they're good at influencing, and they

2436
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:52.550
Orlando Sequera: leadership.

2437
04:19:52.700 --> 04:19:54.010
Orlando Sequera: But one asked.

2438
04:19:55.250 --> 04:19:58.509
Orlando Sequera: And when it comes to working with teams is

2439
04:19:58.750 --> 04:20:00.160
Orlando Sequera: motivation.

2440
04:20:00.930 --> 04:20:05.280
Orlando Sequera: So motivation rolls down to lead people towards having the desire

2441
04:20:07.090 --> 04:20:16.480
Orlando Sequera: a skill set, and for that you need to motivate them. Remember that in most cases, as the project managers, we are not going to

2442
04:20:16.560 --> 04:20:23.200
Orlando Sequera: half the level of a 30. We have to use leadership, so we use inspiration with motivation to lead the team

2443
04:20:23.270 --> 04:20:24.859
Orlando Sequera: as servant leaders.

2444
04:20:25.090 --> 04:20:30.600
Orlando Sequera: so there are some elements that are associated with motivation. The first one is

2445
04:20:30.870 --> 04:20:32.699
Orlando Sequera: achievement or drive.

2446
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:36.670

Orlando Sequera: driving hard to get results

2448
04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:41.740
Orlando Sequera: and and satisfy or exceed

2449
04:20:42.520 --> 04:20:52.930
Orlando Sequera: aspirations and ideas, and discover how to operate capabilities, and always try to minimize uncertainty and discover ways to improve.

2450
04:20:53.290 --> 04:20:55.190
Orlando Sequera: Second element is

2451
04:20:55.700 --> 04:20:56.789
Orlando Sequera: commitment.

2452
04:20:57.270 --> 04:21:03.139
Orlando Sequera: Relying on your team's core principles that are in the team charter to make decisions

2453
04:21:03.580 --> 04:21:04.570
Orlando Sequera: also

2454
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:07.710
Orlando Sequera: realizing a benefit in a comprehensive quest.

2455
04:21:07.930 --> 04:21:10.580
Orlando Sequera: holistic participation. Everybody involved

2456
04:21:10.770 --> 04:21:11.730
Orlando Sequera: a

2457
04:21:11.810 --> 04:21:16.050
Orlando Sequera: gladly sacrificed to fulfill a substantial company goal

2458
04:21:16.270 --> 04:21:21.459
Orlando Sequera: and look for opportunities to achieve teams. The team mission.

2459
04:21:21.820 --> 04:21:24.379
Orlando Sequera: The next element is initiative

2460
04:21:24.570 --> 04:21:28.449
Orlando Sequera: is going above and beyond to what's essential or anticipated

2461
04:21:28.720 --> 04:21:33.320
Orlando Sequera: is inspiring others through externally resource resourceful feat.

2462
04:21:33.490 --> 04:21:37.550
Orlando Sequera: and being prepared to grab or seize opportunities.

2463
04:21:37.730 --> 04:21:40.389
Orlando Sequera: And the last one is optimism

2464
04:21:41.530 --> 04:21:42.740
Orlando Sequera: and

2465
04:21:43.900 --> 04:21:50.919
Orlando Sequera: hope to succeed, not do not fear, failure, hope to succeed, hope to succeed, and that is

2466
04:21:51.030 --> 04:22:00.160
Orlando Sequera: probably the most important aspect, at least in my personal opinion of motivation. You we plan to succeed. We hope to so, although

2467
04:22:00.650 --> 04:22:03.780
Orlando Sequera: I always remember this.

2468
04:22:04.440 --> 04:22:12.909
Orlando Sequera: this NASA director that one time said, Well hope it's not a plan, but we have to be optimistic. We are not fearing failure.

2469
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:16.869
Orlando Sequera: whatever it takes. That's why we're we're starting so hard to

2470
04:22:16.890 --> 04:22:18.520
Orlando Sequera: to become a

2471
04:22:18.690 --> 04:22:37.040
Orlando Sequera: Mp. Certified. That's why we're taking the time, and we we're gonna pull the all the blocks from tiers to make sure that we master this, this content to get ready for the Pmp. Exam. So hope to succeed. Do not hope to a to fail is Don't fear, failure, plan and work, and hope to succeed

2472
04:22:37.050 --> 04:22:38.859
Orlando Sequera: a perceived reversal

2473
04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:50.399
Orlando Sequera: as something that is under your control, that you can address is reversals as caused by something that you can control a controllable factor rather than a personal defect.

2474
04:22:50.490 --> 04:23:02.269
Orlando Sequera: and steadily working towards calls, regardless of barriers and glitches. Okay, we're towards your goals. That's why we told you at the at the beginning of the class

2475
04:23:02.700 --> 04:23:21.990
Orlando Sequera: to get ready for the Pmp. Exam. It's. It's hard work. It's not easy. This is a lot of content, as you can see, using this as an example. But I want to motivate you. It is achievable. It requires a lot of hard work, but you have what you need. This is the content that you need to to make sure that you, master.

2476
04:23:22.000 --> 04:23:31.080
Orlando Sequera: take practice questions. You're going to need an average 100 h on top of this class. It's not going to be overnight. You can slice and Dx to our spot.

2477
04:23:31.240 --> 04:23:38.179
Orlando Sequera: Plan to succeed, hope to succeed. Do not plan for failure. Otherwise you are

2478
04:23:38.720 --> 04:23:46.409
Orlando Sequera: The results are not going to be positive. Okay, it is doable. It is a little hard work, but it is doable. So those are the motivation elements.

2479
04:23:46.610 --> 04:23:47.510
Orlando Sequera: And

2480
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:50.439
Orlando Sequera: for those of you that come from the military, you know Exactly.

2481
04:23:50.590 --> 04:23:52.730
Orlando Sequera: This is not the first time that you have heard

2482
04:23:52.940 --> 04:23:56.530
Orlando Sequera: a these concepts. I'm. Sure i'm a 100% sure.

2483
04:23:57.360 --> 04:24:00.220
Orlando Sequera: All right. So what have we covered? So far?

2484
04:24:00.470 --> 04:24:01.490
Orlando Sequera: It.

2485
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:04.810
Orlando Sequera: We have talked about supporting team performance

2486
04:24:05.320 --> 04:24:11.539
Orlando Sequera: price, team, member performance Again, Api's support and recognized team member, growth and development.

2487
04:24:11.620 --> 04:24:16.179
Orlando Sequera: develop the right feedback, approach and verify performance improvement.

2488
04:24:16.450 --> 04:24:32.639
Orlando Sequera: Remember that it. The assessing team performance is not about disciplinary sanctions. They're not a direct report. It's not the yearly evaluation. We are looking at their performance, and we're trying to help our team members to do better. That's what we are trying to do.

2489
04:24:32.670 --> 04:24:41.749
Orlando Sequera: and then we have to promote this team performance through the application of emotional intelligence super important for the Pmp. Exam.

2490
04:24:42.540 --> 04:24:53.030
Orlando Sequera: Please make sure that you understand emotional intelligence. Really? Well, you should expect questions that are related to emotional intelligence in your Pmp. Exam.

2491
04:24:53.080 --> 04:24:57.210
Orlando Sequera: And by related to emotional intelligence. They are not going to ask you

2492
04:24:57.440 --> 04:25:03.730
Orlando Sequera: about the definition. They're going to ask you about the application. How can you use the emotional intelligence to

2493
04:25:04.110 --> 04:25:11.539
Orlando Sequera: it? Solve this scenario questions, and if you want to get more information, what type of questions can you get

2494
04:25:12.320 --> 04:25:25.910
Orlando Sequera: related to emotional intelligence or conflict management, or any topic? Take practice questions in test Prep. You have the resource, the best resource that can help you with that. Take practice questions in test Prep.

2495
04:25:26.300 --> 04:25:32.980
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So before we continue the next topic that we're going to cover is

2496
04:25:33.940 --> 04:25:41.709
Orlando Sequera: communicate and collaborate with stakeholders. But before that I would like to take a look at the Q. A. And answer

2497
04:25:43.460 --> 04:25:48.849
Orlando Sequera: any questions that are content related. Remember to vote on the questions that you would like

2498
04:25:49.110 --> 04:25:50.490
Orlando Sequera: me to

2499
04:25:52.200 --> 04:25:53.590
Orlando Sequera: answer.

2500
04:25:54.660 --> 04:25:55.949
Orlando Sequera: first.

2501
04:26:09.460 --> 04:26:13.749
Orlando Sequera: what this politics? There's a question in chat. What does politics have to do with empathy?

2502
04:26:13.920 --> 04:26:16.110
Orlando Sequera: It it's more about the

2503
04:26:17.400 --> 04:26:20.899
Orlando Sequera: organizational culture. You need to understand.

2504
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.920
Orlando Sequera: They

2505
04:26:22.680 --> 04:26:27.650
Orlando Sequera: one part of the organization, of course, is gonna be the politics, and that's

2506
04:26:27.960 --> 04:26:29.949
Orlando Sequera: is tied up to

2507
04:26:30.020 --> 04:26:36.140
Orlando Sequera: the motivational aspect because it could be something that is affecting your team members. They can.

2508
04:26:36.170 --> 04:26:39.379
Orlando Sequera: Politics, office politics can have any. It's it's a

2509
04:26:39.680 --> 04:26:52.109
Orlando Sequera: an enterprise, environmental factor that can that can have an impact on your team members performance. So that's why it's mentioned in that context. Okay? And the question was, what does politics have to do with empathy and

2510
04:26:53.150 --> 04:27:01.650
Orlando Sequera: being paying attention and and caring over other people's emotions and and feelings. So that's what empathy,

2511
04:27:02.080 --> 04:27:04.259
Orlando Sequera: In this context is referring to.

2512
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:09.029
Orlando Sequera: another question.

2513
04:27:10.380 --> 04:27:15.200
Orlando Sequera: Will the exam be asking for death for deep knowledge

2514
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:25.429
Orlando Sequera: of the measuring tools other than the names. The exam is a critical thinking. Again, They're not going to ask you about specific tools. The scenario questions are going to be

2515
04:27:26.760 --> 04:27:40.019
Orlando Sequera: a very specific about a situation in a project. And then how can you fix that problem? How can you fix that situation again? My my recommendation is, Go to test, Prep and take practice questions.

2516
04:27:40.660 --> 04:27:42.580
Orlando Sequera: and you'll have a better idea.

2517
04:27:50.590 --> 04:28:03.389
Orlando Sequera: Another question is, how should how should we prepare for the Pmp. It's a reading on Agile and PIN book after this book came, and then taking practice test. No, we said that on day one

2518
04:28:03.680 --> 04:28:05.159
Orlando Sequera: you can take

2519
04:28:05.350 --> 04:28:06.390
Orlando Sequera: your

2520
04:28:06.490 --> 04:28:11.389
Orlando Sequera: this class. Take your boot, can watch the replace. We're going over the entire content.

2521
04:28:11.440 --> 04:28:14.259
Orlando Sequera: You can go to Percipio and watch.

2522
04:28:14.980 --> 04:28:18.749
Orlando Sequera: They specific videos on topics recorded videos already.

2523
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:27.349
Orlando Sequera: Barb does a great job in breaking down these concepts, and you have access to those videos as well to reinforce the knowledge

2524
04:28:27.390 --> 04:28:29.329
Orlando Sequera: and take practice questions.

2525
04:28:30.430 --> 04:28:38.469
Orlando Sequera: and in average is going to take you to get ready for the exam anywhere from 80 to 100 h on top of this class, so

2526
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:44.199
Orlando Sequera: that in that that involves taking practice, questions, reviewing the materials, performance, or analysis.

2527
04:28:44.250 --> 04:28:47.350
Orlando Sequera: To understand what are your strengths around your weaknesses?

2528
04:28:47.470 --> 04:28:54.809
Orlando Sequera: What are some of the opportunities and threats. So try to try to do that and then and use the exam. Content Outline for that.

2529
04:28:54.910 --> 04:29:00.570
Orlando Sequera: So that'll be my recommendation. Okay. But you have everything you need in order to be

2530
04:29:00.780 --> 04:29:01.869
Orlando Sequera: successful.

04:29:05.100 --> 04:29:05.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2532
04:29:09.350 --> 04:29:10.380
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2533
04:29:13.530 --> 04:29:26.799
Orlando Sequera: There is another. I think it's a comment in the in the Q. A. Hiring a trainer for this team building and emotional intelligence needs is important. Many times people need other games or tools.

2534
04:29:28.040 --> 04:29:28.890
Orlando Sequera: sorry

2535
04:29:30.900 --> 04:29:33.119
Orlando Sequera: other games. The tools to help them grow

2536
04:29:33.330 --> 04:29:47.810
Orlando Sequera: in this not always possible as a Pm. To help others increase emotional intelligence, real work thoughts for me to this class. That's true. As for Pmp. Exam. This slide is very important to know. So to test questions on how to address the situation

2537
04:29:48.330 --> 04:29:51.369
Orlando Sequera: and collaboration, Thank you. Yes, that is

2538
04:29:51.540 --> 04:29:53.490
Orlando Sequera: a 100% correct.

2539
04:29:53.980 --> 04:30:00.740
Orlando Sequera: but for the exam you have to, and it's remember that they're promoting best practices. Right? So

2540
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:10.530
Orlando Sequera: a real real life might be a little bit different. But yes, for the exam. You have to do your best to incorporate in emotional intelligence.

2541
04:30:13.740 --> 04:30:14.840
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2542
04:30:18.670 --> 04:30:19.910
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2543
04:30:20.480 --> 04:30:21.630
Orlando Sequera: I think

2544
04:30:22.640 --> 04:30:25.110
Orlando Sequera: I think we are cut up with the questions.

2545
04:30:25.190 --> 04:30:26.140
Orlando Sequera: Yeah.

2546
04:30:27.300 --> 04:30:30.250
Orlando Sequera: thank you for for that advice.

2547
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:37.119
Orlando Sequera: Yes, I think we are cut up with the questions. All right. Now. We're gonna continue.

2548
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:51.600
Orlando Sequera: A the next topic is going to be communication and collaboration with stakeholders. We mentioned that before is coming up again this is really important, or the exam as well. This is how we keep our stakeholders engage.

2549
04:30:51.980 --> 04:30:53.780
Orlando Sequera: Communication is

2550
04:30:54.730 --> 04:31:01.800
Orlando Sequera: the real work of leadership. And this is something that the Dean of the hardware business school said in

2551
04:31:02.150 --> 04:31:03.730
Orlando Sequera: Santa what I

2552
04:31:04.420 --> 04:31:06.740
Orlando Sequera: so a while back.

2553
04:31:06.940 --> 04:31:11.790
Orlando Sequera: A communications are both personal, and they are also strategic

2554
04:31:13.280 --> 04:31:15.780
Orlando Sequera: as a project manager.

2555
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:18.009
Orlando Sequera: and this is according to some experts.

2556
04:31:19.290 --> 04:31:21.170
Orlando Sequera: You are going to spend

2557
04:31:21.800 --> 04:31:25.890
Orlando Sequera: 90% or more of your time communicating in

2558
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:28.920
Orlando Sequera: one form or another.

2559
04:31:29.580 --> 04:31:34.940
Orlando Sequera: You have to be able to manage, and I see some of the questions I will say the

2560
04:31:35.470 --> 04:31:47.649
Orlando Sequera: some of you that are mute to break management. You see that there's a lot of artifacts that we have to manage. There's a lot of moving parts that come on these multiple plans, this many

2561
04:31:48.380 --> 04:31:54.429
Orlando Sequera: artifacts that we have to keep up. Yes, you have to be able to manage volumes of

2562
04:31:55.100 --> 04:31:56.970
Orlando Sequera: formal and informal

2563
04:31:57.310 --> 04:32:01.650
Orlando Sequera: documents, conversations, emails. That is your job

2564
04:32:01.960 --> 04:32:03.689
Orlando Sequera: making sure that

2565
04:32:04.090 --> 04:32:09.960
Orlando Sequera: everything is happen. Everything needs to happen is happened. The coordinations that need to occur are happening

2566
04:32:10.160 --> 04:32:29.270
Orlando Sequera: because the people who are doing the work are the team members. Okay, you are helping the team in a different capacity, keeping everything organized, everything coordinated, making sure that they have everything they need to do their work, providing status to a stakeholders and opera management.

2567
04:32:29.340 --> 04:32:33.740
Orlando Sequera: addressing, making sure that you have plans in place to address risks.

2568
04:32:33.840 --> 04:32:42.070
Orlando Sequera: address any challenges that are related to the budget. I've raised any challenges that are related to the schedule. You are keeping the share.

2569
04:32:42.160 --> 04:32:43.909
Orlando Sequera: but the ones that are doing

2570
04:32:44.250 --> 04:32:45.619
Orlando Sequera: are your

2571
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:57.520
Orlando Sequera: project team members. They're the subject matter experts. Okay. So you, in order to be successful. You have to have healthy, collaborative working relationship with the team.

2572
04:32:57.580 --> 04:32:59.180
Orlando Sequera: and not only

2573
04:32:59.560 --> 04:33:05.160
Orlando Sequera: with the team members, but also with your stakeholders, and we do that. We build that through

2574
04:33:05.180 --> 04:33:07.390
Orlando Sequera: communication. Okay.

2575
04:33:07.480 --> 04:33:12.750
Orlando Sequera: A: so it's also very important that we know that we make sure

2576
04:33:12.880 --> 04:33:19.549
Orlando Sequera: that the right information is getting to the right stakeholder so they can make the best decisions

2577
04:33:20.250 --> 04:33:21.460
Orlando Sequera: we in.

2578
04:33:21.790 --> 04:33:24.959
Orlando Sequera: As I said before, it's not always going to be.

2579
04:33:25.540 --> 04:33:39.759
Orlando Sequera: It's not always gonna be a blue skies, green pastures, right? That everything is great, and we're having always like, come by a moment. Nope, that's not the case. We're gonna face some storms. We're gonna face some challenges.

2580
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:45.359
Orlando Sequera: And but when we have to deliver the bad news, if we have kept

2581
04:33:45.509 --> 04:33:46.570
Orlando Sequera: our

2582
04:33:46.900 --> 04:33:48.710
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders inform

2583
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:54.629
Orlando Sequera: the challenges that we might be having what we're doing to address those challenges.

2584
04:33:55.110 --> 04:33:59.449
Orlando Sequera: and we have been able to build trust with them from day one

2585
04:33:59.619 --> 04:34:02.670
Orlando Sequera: when the moment of giving them bad news comes.

2586
04:34:02.720 --> 04:34:03.810
Orlando Sequera: Probably

2587
04:34:04.169 --> 04:34:11.359
Orlando Sequera: they're They're not gonna even be surprised. Chances are they're not gonna be even be surprised because they're right there with you. They're gonna be able to

2588
04:34:11.630 --> 04:34:16.800
Orlando Sequera: witness firsthand the challenges that might be coming down the horizon.

2589
04:34:16.960 --> 04:34:19.320
Orlando Sequera: And they're going to understand.

2590
04:34:19.369 --> 04:34:30.770
Orlando Sequera: We are as project managers in the business of avoiding at all costs any surprises. Okay, and that goes back to what we were mentioning before being transparent.

2591
04:34:31.020 --> 04:34:32.480
Orlando Sequera: We we can be

2592
04:34:32.599 --> 04:34:35.040
Orlando Sequera: pain in a picture that is not real.

2593
04:34:35.300 --> 04:34:37.470
Orlando Sequera: We have to, we are

2594
04:34:38.099 --> 04:34:47.269
Orlando Sequera: we, we we have to abide by by the by, Pmi's code of ethics. We have to be transparent. That is really important. So

2595
04:34:47.509 --> 04:34:50.350
Orlando Sequera: a don't be afraid of giving bad news.

2596
04:34:50.419 --> 04:34:58.779
Orlando Sequera: The promise come when you in your status reports, for example, have intended everyone. Everything is great. Risks are under control.

2597
04:34:58.890 --> 04:35:04.179
Orlando Sequera: Our a no challenges with the schedule, no challenges with the budget. But then

2598
04:35:04.849 --> 04:35:09.590
Orlando Sequera: you know that it that that is not the case, and you can hide it anymore. And

2599
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:11.320
Orlando Sequera: 4 weeks from now

2600
04:35:12.250 --> 04:35:28.270
Orlando Sequera: everything, the the the the flock gates are open, and we have major delays. May your cost over us for what happened in the previous tennis reports. That's when your stakeholders are going to to start questioning the way you're managing the project. So

2601
04:35:28.480 --> 04:35:31.270
Orlando Sequera: build that trust for communication.

2602
04:35:31.570 --> 04:35:44.039
Orlando Sequera: be Provide the information in Don't. Be afraid to give mad news, it happens, but if you build it frost, they're going to be there. They're going to understand, and the response is going to be different compared to

2603
04:35:44.450 --> 04:35:56.179
Orlando Sequera: and giving them okay and catching your your, your stakeholders off guard with a surprise. Right? So that is crucial. That is crucial

2604
04:35:57.080 --> 04:35:58.070
Orlando Sequera: also.

2605
04:36:00.520 --> 04:36:05.340
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect that is related to communication is, as we have said before.

2606
04:36:06.220 --> 04:36:07.790
Orlando Sequera: we have to keep

2607
04:36:08.689 --> 04:36:10.519
Orlando Sequera: the polls speed about

2608
04:36:10.740 --> 04:36:20.559
Orlando Sequera: the engagement of those stakeholders, regardless of the approach. Whether we're going with a predictive approach or agile approach, we have to keep our stakeholders engage.

2609
04:36:20.599 --> 04:36:24.279
Orlando Sequera: That is extremely important. This is an ongoing task.

2610
04:36:24.640 --> 04:36:43.440
Orlando Sequera: Remember that we talked about this at the beginning of the project, but this is something that we have to do periodically throughout the project. That is not a set formula that says, oh, you have to do this every 2 weeks. No, every project is different. But this is something that you have to do throughout your project

2611
04:36:43.810 --> 04:36:46.979
Orlando Sequera: in order to be successful. Okay.

2612
04:36:48.080 --> 04:36:48.870
Orlando Sequera: So

2613
04:36:48.990 --> 04:36:50.349
Orlando Sequera: use their grit.

2614
04:36:50.960 --> 04:36:53.480
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you're addressing them.

2615
04:36:53.599 --> 04:37:08.289
Orlando Sequera: Place your stakeholders in the grid which ones are the ones that are hyp. For example, right. This is one example: hype we're looking at 2 dimensions here. Power and interest they once are, manage closely. Make sure that they've been managed closely.

2616
04:37:08.740 --> 04:37:11.410
Orlando Sequera: Stakeholders, that is, and

2617
04:37:11.790 --> 04:37:22.520
Orlando Sequera: excuse me, the ones that need to be kept in form, that they are kept in forb. So make sure that you are following this a. Throughout the life cycle of your project.

2618
04:37:22.759 --> 04:37:27.020
Orlando Sequera: and one plan that is going to help you to make sure this happens.

2619
04:37:27.939 --> 04:37:29.260
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be

2620
04:37:29.650 --> 04:37:31.700
Orlando Sequera: the Communications management plan.

2621
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:37.179
Orlando Sequera: because this is going to help you to understand a

2622
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:41.210
Orlando Sequera: which which one of your stakeholders are the senders

2623
04:37:41.240 --> 04:37:48.790
Orlando Sequera: which one of the stakeholders of the receivers which which party individual part is going to be the past their 30.

2624
04:37:48.950 --> 04:38:00.430
Orlando Sequera: It to get confident that's gonna be part of your Communications management plan. What is the type of information that you're going to be sharing. What is the rationale

2625
04:38:00.650 --> 04:38:06.309
Orlando Sequera: to provide that information or communication? What language for men and

2626
04:38:06.640 --> 04:38:12.119
Orlando Sequera: and level of detail is going to be used. How frequently the information has to be delivered.

2627
04:38:13.689 --> 04:38:18.389
Orlando Sequera: and whether in some cases you need acknowledgment or a response.

2628
04:38:18.630 --> 04:38:21.579
Orlando Sequera: What are the processes for escalation?

2629
04:38:21.800 --> 04:38:23.860
Orlando Sequera: We keep measuring escalation. That's

2630
04:38:24.669 --> 04:38:26.519
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be spelled out here

2631
04:38:26.720 --> 04:38:28.740
Orlando Sequera: updating, refining the plan

2632
04:38:28.900 --> 04:38:39.880
Orlando Sequera: how to run your project Status meetings. That's a key aspect of communication. If you're following a predictive approach, you are going to provide status reports to your

2633
04:38:40.430 --> 04:38:52.539
Orlando Sequera: for stakeholders, and they that's gonna be the the format of those reports. Gonna be defined here. How often do you have to to have those titles, reports.

2634
04:38:52.730 --> 04:38:53.690
Orlando Sequera: meetings.

2635
04:38:53.860 --> 04:39:05.369
Orlando Sequera: And also when it comes to product information? What are the communication methods and technologies that we're going to be using a. What are, what are the allocated resources that we have for communication.

2636
04:39:05.480 --> 04:39:14.790
Orlando Sequera: grocery for terminology, any flow charts that are needed workflows, list of reports, meeting plans, and any constraints that are applicable.

2637
04:39:15.340 --> 04:39:21.529
Orlando Sequera: All right. So a lot of information. So we know when it comes to communications we have to.

2638
04:39:22.700 --> 04:39:28.980
Orlando Sequera: How often do I have to send the status report? The answer is in the plan. The communications management plan.

2639
04:39:31.369 --> 04:39:33.770
Orlando Sequera: So when it comes to

2640
04:39:33.930 --> 04:39:36.030
Orlando Sequera: managing product communications.

2641
04:39:37.000 --> 04:39:38.110
Orlando Sequera: They

2642
04:39:39.840 --> 04:39:47.130
Orlando Sequera: This matrix is a shorter bridge, is a shorter version of the communication management tool. This can be a spreadsheet.

2643
04:39:47.240 --> 04:39:49.280
Orlando Sequera: It it can even be in a white port

2644
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:54.719
Orlando Sequera: something, and you can tailor this to your, to your a team.

2645
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:56.810
Orlando Sequera: This communications matrix.

2646
04:39:56.880 --> 04:40:13.660
Orlando Sequera: So it it covers the identified team members and stakeholders, as which one of the senders we want to which one of the receivers which ones the authorized authorized in person. So this is a condensed version of the Communications management plan, and then you'll also cover the

2647
04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:24.520
Orlando Sequera: communication requirements. The type of information, the reason for communication, language, format, content level of detail, the frequency, and whether we need

2648
04:40:24.560 --> 04:40:30.270
Orlando Sequera: a acknowledgment or a response is required. And what are the templates for escalation.

2649
04:40:30.290 --> 04:40:34.620
Orlando Sequera: and also the communication methods of technology. So you can use either

2650
04:40:34.840 --> 04:40:36.310
Orlando Sequera: the full-blown

2651
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:48.370
Orlando Sequera: communications management plan, or at the very least, you can use a condensed version, which is what we call the communications matrix. But you have to

2652
04:40:48.690 --> 04:40:50.700
Orlando Sequera: a keep that into

2653
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:53.100
Orlando Sequera: into account. Okay.

2654
04:40:54.880 --> 04:40:56.840
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2655
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:59.000
Orlando Sequera: communication.

2656
04:40:59.840 --> 04:41:01.829
Orlando Sequera: education is a 2 waste, free

2657
04:41:02.980 --> 04:41:06.740
Orlando Sequera: and important aspects, and we talked about

2658
04:41:06.940 --> 04:41:10.610
Orlando Sequera: the communication, the the basic communication model.

2659
04:41:10.640 --> 04:41:11.340
Orlando Sequera: But

2660
04:41:11.690 --> 04:41:13.570
Orlando Sequera: we're going to leave it deeper here.

2661
04:41:13.690 --> 04:41:18.979
Orlando Sequera: A active listening and performing feedback are critical communication techniques.

2662
04:41:19.610 --> 04:41:32.259
Orlando Sequera: They are critical. It's about active listening. It's about effective feedback, we, when we use active listening, the listener must focus on attention Most focused. He or her attention

2663
04:41:32.350 --> 04:41:43.540
Orlando Sequera: on the message to the end, rather than trying to formulate the response in a premature way. In it being, we have to pay attention until the end.

2664
04:41:43.770 --> 04:41:44.710
Orlando Sequera: Not

2665
04:41:44.950 --> 04:41:47.420
Orlando Sequera: try to

2666
04:41:48.200 --> 04:41:53.359
Orlando Sequera: Come up with an answer while we are receiving the message. Okay. So

2667
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:58.799
Orlando Sequera: when we're following active listening, this is going to help us with collaboration?

2668
04:41:59.320 --> 04:42:01.460
Orlando Sequera: We can ask

2669
04:42:01.660 --> 04:42:08.829
Orlando Sequera: they. It requires a listener to provide feedback about what they heard. It's about restating. You can

2670
04:42:08.860 --> 04:42:13.879
Orlando Sequera: gonna repeat the gist of the message to confirm proper understanding

2671
04:42:13.960 --> 04:42:26.560
Orlando Sequera: we can use. You can restate it, you can paraphrase, and you can use some body language like not in the head for acknowledgment that you are understanding. And if you're using active listening means that you're

2672
04:42:26.870 --> 04:42:30.959
Orlando Sequera: your confirm and understanding, and you are working on building trust.

2673
04:42:31.180 --> 04:42:33.200
Orlando Sequera: Effective feedback is.

2674
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:44.059
Orlando Sequera: should be of offer in a timely manner. It's subjective and critical, and it's positive it's receive as understood, an objective is negative.

2675
04:42:44.140 --> 04:42:51.119
Orlando Sequera: If misunderstood, or there, or if there is a lack of trust or psychological safety. Okay.

2676
04:42:51.480 --> 04:42:52.800
Orlando Sequera: A.

2677
04:42:53.110 --> 04:43:06.640
Orlando Sequera: As we have, we have heard, probably multiple times. No news is good news. A lack of feedback is an implicit, implicit acceptance of the message by the receiver. Okay.

2678
04:43:06.730 --> 04:43:15.369
Orlando Sequera: try to provide feedback. Please do not ignore people. Reply to those emails we we have to, we we have to

2679
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:24.410
Orlando Sequera: keep that in mind. Okay, I know that there's a high volume of communication, but the only people people have a hanging, a communication failures.

2680
04:43:24.630 --> 04:43:30.370
Orlando Sequera: This is important communication. Failures are threats to projects. And what? What is a threat?

2681
04:43:31.500 --> 04:43:33.919
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna unpo the chat for a minute.

2682
04:43:34.190 --> 04:43:37.799
Orlando Sequera: What is a threat to our project? And the chat is

2683
04:43:39.220 --> 04:43:40.920
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Past. What is the threat?

2684
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:46.339
Orlando Sequera: It is a risk for what type of risk.

2685
04:43:46.470 --> 04:43:49.450
Orlando Sequera: It is a negative risk. Correct? I'm: going to post the chat.

2686
04:43:52.850 --> 04:43:54.410
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

2687
04:43:54.580 --> 04:43:59.380
Orlando Sequera: this is another aspect that you have another category in your risk

2688
04:43:59.490 --> 04:44:00.860
Orlando Sequera: classification.

2689
04:44:00.880 --> 04:44:04.389
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you discuss any communications.

2690
04:44:04.420 --> 04:44:07.880
Orlando Sequera: a risks or issues openly with the team.

2691
04:44:08.600 --> 04:44:10.289
Orlando Sequera: with team members directly.

2692
04:44:10.390 --> 04:44:14.080
Orlando Sequera: If you're following an agile approach during the retrospective.

2693
04:44:14.250 --> 04:44:31.299
Orlando Sequera: In the case of key stakeholders you met you might need to escalate, For example, you're trying to get information. You have done everything possible within your reach to get a hold of a key stakeholder that is not providing you with information that is needed by the team.

2694
04:44:31.380 --> 04:44:35.530
Orlando Sequera: And you have done everything you send multiple emails. You

2695
04:44:36.020 --> 04:44:50.480
Orlando Sequera: You have face to face meetings with the individual, but it still weren't able to get the information that was needed. They're not repunt responding. You're leaving voicemail, they don't respond. You're doing everything that you can within

2696
04:44:50.520 --> 04:45:06.249
Orlando Sequera: your breach, and it's not working. If you have exhausted all the options available. Then you go to the nuclear option, which is escalation, and usually your best PET is going to be to work with your sponsor. Usually the sponsor has

2697
04:45:06.260 --> 04:45:21.330
Orlando Sequera: Is someone in upper management that can help you in that situation, right? But you have to do your due diligence. You have to try to solve it as much as possible within the constraint of the team. But if that is not enough, then you can escalate and get the help from from someone else

2698
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:26.300
Orlando Sequera: Okay, as needed, but always think of escalation as the last resort.

2699
04:45:29.500 --> 04:45:31.930
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to communications.

2700
04:45:32.980 --> 04:45:33.910
Orlando Sequera: A

2701
04:45:34.800 --> 04:45:40.089
Orlando Sequera: some projects are gonna require more for more communication methods like reports.

2702
04:45:40.210 --> 04:45:46.190
Orlando Sequera: and in many cases these reports are going to need sign offs.

2703
04:45:46.480 --> 04:45:47.590
Orlando Sequera: and

2704
04:45:47.660 --> 04:45:50.240
Orlando Sequera: you have to understand clearly.

2705
04:45:50.700 --> 04:46:09.729
Orlando Sequera: and that's part of the communications management plan the frequency of these reports. When do they need to get them in order to provide them in a timely manner? Okay. So this: the recipients of reports are going to be in the stakeholder engagement plan, and in the Communications management plan can.

2706
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:18.319
Orlando Sequera: And i'm gonna i'm gonna impose a chat. Can anyone give an example of a report that you use in your organization feel free to use the chat.

2707
04:46:20.320 --> 04:46:22.150
Orlando Sequera: Can you think of any reports

2708
04:46:25.400 --> 04:46:26.240
Orlando Sequera: weekly.

2709
04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:28.930
Orlando Sequera: or it's daily status reports.

2710
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:32.729
Orlando Sequera: deployment report, monthly status report Exactly.

2711
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:38.669
Orlando Sequera: Kpi's monitoring visit report, status report exactly

2712
04:46:38.780 --> 04:46:39.750
Orlando Sequera: Exactly.

2713
04:46:40.920 --> 04:46:44.260
Orlando Sequera: Quality report. Yes, release, report

2714
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.990

04:46:46.440 --> 04:46:47.220
Orlando Sequera: Correct.

2716
04:46:47.800 --> 04:46:49.630
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to post the chat.

2717
04:46:50.740 --> 04:46:52.749
Orlando Sequera: So thank you. Correct. So

2718
04:46:53.280 --> 04:47:01.480
Orlando Sequera: those reports, some of them are going to be applicable. Some of them might not be a pickable depends on the industry. It depends on the organization, but that's correct. And

2719
04:47:02.450 --> 04:47:22.359
Orlando Sequera: so they might need to be more formal than others. But some of the ones that some of you mentioned here. The status reports, those are key, and usually we have to define in there the actual, what are we reporting on? Usually right? This can change from organization to organization, but usually at the very least.

2720
04:47:22.370 --> 04:47:24.629
Orlando Sequera: This is where we're going to report about

2721
04:47:25.240 --> 04:47:26.320
Orlando Sequera: our schedule.

2722
04:47:26.690 --> 04:47:29.570
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to be able to answer that question

2723
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:34.140
Orlando Sequera: that our stakeholders have is my project on time? Is my project

2724
04:47:34.440 --> 04:47:36.280
Orlando Sequera: behind schedule or

2725
04:47:36.620 --> 04:47:37.910
Orlando Sequera: ahead of schedule.

2726
04:47:38.040 --> 04:47:45.769
Orlando Sequera: and for that we're going to use when we cover and value management, we're going to start seeing some metrics that can help us

2727
04:47:45.800 --> 04:47:53.789
Orlando Sequera: to understand that can be applied to any project we're going to learn about Spi, for example, scheduled performance index when we get to and running management.

2728
04:47:54.030 --> 04:47:56.590
Orlando Sequera: we also gonna provide information about our budget.

2729
04:47:56.650 --> 04:47:57.679
Orlando Sequera: Are we

2730
04:47:57.990 --> 04:48:00.430
Orlando Sequera: our budget on their budget? Or

2731
04:48:00.450 --> 04:48:03.310
Orlando Sequera: are we a on budget.

2732
04:48:03.360 --> 04:48:06.570
Orlando Sequera: right, or an information about risks?

2733
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:15.310
Orlando Sequera: These are the risks that were identified? These are the risk that materialized and became issues, negative risks. And this is what we are doing.

2734
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:21.790
Orlando Sequera: And because you're gonna those are the questions that you're gonna get. Most of that status report meeting. Have you ever been

2735
04:48:21.860 --> 04:48:22.790
Orlando Sequera: to

2736
04:48:22.900 --> 04:48:37.979
Orlando Sequera: to one of those? That is, those 3 topics are part of it. Usually that is the case. Okay, Of course they might be some additional topics, for mainly it's going to be. That is, the health of those are health indicators of your project

2737
04:48:38.060 --> 04:48:40.159
Orlando Sequera: in most situations.

2738
04:48:40.220 --> 04:48:41.070
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2739
04:48:42.740 --> 04:48:43.840
Orlando Sequera: Also.

2740
04:48:47.200 --> 04:48:48.780
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2741
04:48:52.640 --> 04:48:54.660
Orlando Sequera: knowing how to collaborate

2742
04:48:57.010 --> 04:49:01.609
Orlando Sequera: effective collaboration, we have to build trust. I can keep

2743
04:49:02.360 --> 04:49:19.379
Orlando Sequera: stress in that. Enough. We have to build trust with our team members with our stakeholders. This is about open dialogue and meaningful communication that helps to achieve and build that trust. Okay, and sharing the expectations of results, and what needs to be done?

2744
04:49:19.390 --> 04:49:30.140
Orlando Sequera: Everyone's involvement and engagement in the project may fluctuate or remain constant. In some cases, so not all stakeholders are going to keep keep the same level of engagement.

2745
04:49:30.280 --> 04:49:31.780
Orlando Sequera: That's what we're saying here.

2746
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:40.030
Orlando Sequera: going back to the example of the software for the account and department. We have the director of accounting as one of the key stakeholders.

2747
04:49:41.710 --> 04:49:42.520
Orlando Sequera: They

2748
04:49:42.570 --> 04:49:43.770
Orlando Sequera: engagement.

2749
04:49:44.770 --> 04:49:46.330
Orlando Sequera: A level

2750
04:49:46.660 --> 04:49:51.280
Orlando Sequera: with our project is going to fluctuate. That is an individual that is very basic.

2751
04:49:51.640 --> 04:49:54.580
Orlando Sequera: They have other projects. They have operations.

2752
04:49:54.650 --> 04:49:56.930
Orlando Sequera: What is happening within the organization. So

2753
04:49:57.020 --> 04:50:00.149
Orlando Sequera: we it's a fact of life. It's going to fluctuate, but

2754
04:50:00.220 --> 04:50:08.489
Orlando Sequera: we have to work with them, Bill, from. They want that trust to make sure that when we need input from them

2755
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:10.040
Orlando Sequera: they are

2756
04:50:10.130 --> 04:50:14.110
Orlando Sequera: available, or they can designate or delegate

2757
04:50:14.610 --> 04:50:26.859
Orlando Sequera: to another individual that will represent them. That will provide the information that the team members need. That is what we have to do. It's okay. They can delegate to someone else. But when we need the information

2758
04:50:26.900 --> 04:50:31.889
Orlando Sequera: they need to be available to provide that information. Otherwise the project is not

2759
04:50:31.980 --> 04:50:39.830
Orlando Sequera: going to be successful, so we' to make sure that they understand that a. We should keep our discussions transparent.

2760
04:50:39.920 --> 04:50:42.140
Orlando Sequera: If we have to give bad news.

2761
04:50:42.260 --> 04:50:56.879
Orlando Sequera: be open about it. It's okay. Set the right expectations. It's about sending the right expectations. Okay, If you keep them engaged. If you keep them in form, they're going to know they're going to be right there with you when that when those

2762
04:50:57.400 --> 04:51:11.830
Orlando Sequera: clouds start forming in the horizon. Okay, there, they'll see them right there with you. You don't have to even tell them if you do your due diligence. Okay, so. But it's about transparency and setting the right expectations. A.

2763
04:51:12.250 --> 04:51:19.780
Orlando Sequera: And then come Here's where your communication skills in your personal skills feedback meeting management. Among other management

2764
04:51:20.360 --> 04:51:24.939
Orlando Sequera: a skills are really handy and important.

2765
04:51:25.010 --> 04:51:29.439
Orlando Sequera: Leverage that maximize the feedback loop that you get

2766
04:51:29.720 --> 04:51:32.500
Orlando Sequera: that you can get from them and use

2767
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:40.240
Orlando Sequera: effective tools like sample wipers or any other tools to achieve that goal.

2768
04:51:40.740 --> 04:51:41.600
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2769
04:51:42.650 --> 04:51:45.420
Orlando Sequera: I would like to take a look

2770
04:51:45.550 --> 04:51:47.540
Orlando Sequera: questions, and

2771
04:51:47.850 --> 04:51:50.520
Orlando Sequera: after that we're going to.

2772
04:51:50.640 --> 04:51:52.219
Orlando Sequera: We're going to take a break.

2773
04:51:53.320 --> 04:51:54.720
Orlando Sequera: so we

2774
04:51:57.370 --> 04:51:59.339
Orlando Sequera: so then we can.

2775
04:52:00.130 --> 04:52:03.220
Orlando Sequera: So then we'll come back and continue with the content.

2776
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:08.300
Orlando Sequera: All right, so let me.

2777
04:52:17.100 --> 04:52:24.190
Orlando Sequera: is the communication management plan made only for predictive. If you see the work plan is mainly for predictive.

2778
04:52:24.290 --> 04:52:31.740
Orlando Sequera: Yes, but you still have a you need have. You need to have a communication approach for your adaptive projects as well.

2779
04:52:40.130 --> 04:52:43.170
Orlando Sequera: Are there any keywords phrases

2780
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:45.789
Orlando Sequera: to let us know when to choose the

2781
04:52:45.910 --> 04:52:48.080
Orlando Sequera: a stakeholder and get some plan versus

2782
04:52:48.180 --> 04:52:56.670
Orlando Sequera: hmm, Not really a the questions i'm not going to be geared, or let me repeat the question. My apologies, my probably the question.

2783
04:52:58.220 --> 04:53:09.909
Orlando Sequera: Are there any keywords or phrases to let us know when to choose the stakeholder engagement plan versus the communication management plan in the exam. Usually the questions are not

2784
04:53:10.080 --> 04:53:14.869
Orlando Sequera: about choosing which plan they're not going to be around that these are

2785
04:53:15.170 --> 04:53:18.469
Orlando Sequera: the goal with these plans is to understand this.

2786
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:23.670
Orlando Sequera: These are the rules that we're going to follow to address those specific areas. But there they don't

2787
04:53:23.960 --> 04:53:27.370
Orlando Sequera: ask you about that. They're going to give you a scenario

2788
04:53:27.850 --> 04:53:29.850
Orlando Sequera: and

2789
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:33.779
Orlando Sequera: you have to fix the problem that they are

2790
04:53:34.040 --> 04:53:37.910
Orlando Sequera: presenting with that scenario. That's how the questions are going to be

2791
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:40.420
Orlando Sequera: to get a better idea Again.

2792
04:53:40.810 --> 04:53:45.289
Orlando Sequera: I wholeheartedly recommend to take practice questions in desperate

2793
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:50.539
Orlando Sequera: another question.

2794
04:53:51.280 --> 04:53:54.460
Orlando Sequera: What do you normally utilize instead of names

2795
04:53:54.550 --> 04:53:56.379
Orlando Sequera: for the stakeholder chart.

2796
04:53:56.790 --> 04:54:03.379
Orlando Sequera: How do you know specifically the person to influence? Well, that is.

2797
04:54:03.740 --> 04:54:05.950
Orlando Sequera: let me go back to that slide

2798
04:54:06.250 --> 04:54:15.960
Orlando Sequera: reference the stakeholder. Brid example you cover, please, and explain well your stakeholder register. The answer is your stakeholder register. Remember that list of stakeholders.

2799
04:54:16.010 --> 04:54:21.820
Orlando Sequera: It's a spreadsheet the the stakeholder registered you at that information. You you're going to have

2800
04:54:22.170 --> 04:54:35.139
Orlando Sequera: a information, the name, the contact information, who they are, what type of stakeholder, what is the level of influence in the project. That's where you're going to get that information from. But then the grid and i'm going to go back to

2801
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:45.070
Orlando Sequera: the power and influence great for a second. This is after you have your stakeholder register in place. Do you want to perform some intel

2802
04:54:45.330 --> 04:54:46.890
Orlando Sequera: to understand? Okay.

2803
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:59.410
Orlando Sequera: I have my stakeholder register. I'm going to place all of my stakeholders in this grid to understand which ones do I have to manage closely which ones I need to keep inform, for example, for the accounting

2804
04:54:59.440 --> 04:55:01.769
Orlando Sequera: department software project.

2805
04:55:02.030 --> 04:55:04.630
Orlando Sequera: then the director of accounting

2806
04:55:04.810 --> 04:55:18.020
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna be someone that has high power. Why is that because it is a director level, right? And then high interest, because it is the accounting software for the accounting department. So we have to manage this individual closely.

2807
04:55:18.690 --> 04:55:20.120
Orlando Sequera: but we also have

2808
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:28.460
Orlando Sequera: some the people that work that works in the accounting department like accounts payable accounts receivable. They have

2809
04:55:28.740 --> 04:55:34.780
Orlando Sequera: low power, but they have a high interest. Those are going to be your end users. We need to keep them informed.

2810
04:55:35.090 --> 04:55:42.229
Orlando Sequera: Then we have people that are a the it director, for example, if someone that has high power.

2811
04:55:42.430 --> 04:55:44.120
Orlando Sequera: but they have

2812
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:57.100
Orlando Sequera: a low interest in the project is not an it project it's a it's an accounting, Project? So you want to keep them satisfied. And then you have people, for example, the help desk operators

2813
04:55:57.200 --> 04:56:10.539
Orlando Sequera: that are gonna be supporting the from the the application. They have low power, and they have low interest. Do you monitor their expectations? And why? I'm not saying that a some stakeholders are more important than others. Necessarily.

2814
04:56:10.700 --> 04:56:20.400
Orlando Sequera: No. What we're saying here is that you have to prioritize. You have to prioritize. Okay, always do. You have to protest in your projects. And that's why we

2815
04:56:20.530 --> 04:56:21.800
Orlando Sequera: once we need to

2816
04:56:21.960 --> 04:56:33.849
Orlando Sequera: mostly which ones we need to keep satisfy which ones we need to keep in form, and we which ones. We need to a monitor, and we have to perform this throughout the project. These changes. Okay.

2817
04:56:34.010 --> 04:56:35.740
Orlando Sequera: So that is

2818
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:37.100
Orlando Sequera: how

2819
04:56:37.620 --> 04:56:44.200
Orlando Sequera: this is intel work that we have to perform, and this is key. You need to know who your stakeholders are.

2820
04:56:44.460 --> 04:56:45.530
Orlando Sequera: and

2821
04:56:47.100 --> 04:56:50.590
Orlando Sequera: perform this intel work about your to understand

2822
04:56:52.670 --> 04:56:53.610
Orlando Sequera: a

2823
04:56:53.790 --> 04:56:56.330
Orlando Sequera: to prioritize their engagement.

2824
04:56:57.880 --> 04:57:01.250
Orlando Sequera: it's the communication plan and artifact. Yes.

2825
04:57:02.720 --> 04:57:05.970
Orlando Sequera: if so, wasn't it listed in the early artifact slide.

2826
04:57:06.540 --> 04:57:13.339
Orlando Sequera: Remember that that wasn't the full list right? Those were the typical ones. But yeah, it is one of the

2827
04:57:13.800 --> 04:57:17.579
Orlando Sequera: I I. It is one of the plans that you have to create for your project

2828
04:57:24.830 --> 04:57:33.449
Orlando Sequera: A. In the test Prep. Learning more. One of the questions has which plan to reference of both plans for options. My recommendation is always

2829
04:57:34.110 --> 04:57:39.460
Orlando Sequera: read. The question looks always for the best answer, because

2830
04:57:39.780 --> 04:57:52.489
Orlando Sequera: this is something. Thank you for asking that, by the way, because that will allow me to provide more insight about the Pmp. Exam. Questions with the Pmp. Exam. Questions. They are notorious

2831
04:57:52.630 --> 04:57:53.490
Orlando Sequera: 4.

2832
04:57:53.660 --> 04:57:56.730
Orlando Sequera: The fact that in many cases you're going to have

2833
04:57:57.850 --> 04:58:00.329
Orlando Sequera: 2 options, 2 answers that

2834
04:58:00.380 --> 04:58:06.609
Orlando Sequera: this, this these 2 answers are are good, either one. They're great, they they're good answers.

2835
04:58:06.900 --> 04:58:25.350
Orlando Sequera: but always look for the best. Answer: okay, you might have to that make sense always look for the best answer. We read the question. We read the question, understand exactly what they're asking you, and look for the best possible answer. That is my advice.

2836
04:58:30.060 --> 04:58:34.980
Orlando Sequera: Why are most of these communication slides listed as predictive? Only?

2837
04:58:36.370 --> 04:58:42.000
Orlando Sequera: Well, the thing is that the way communication is happening in that's a good question.

2838
04:58:42.100 --> 04:58:50.510
Orlando Sequera: Why are most of these communication slides listed as predictive only? Is there a reason that agile is so different for this topic in the short answer is, Yes.

2839
04:58:50.680 --> 04:59:06.100
Orlando Sequera: in agile we have built in ceremonies the agile approach has built in ceremonies that account even for the communication aspect they help with that. Do you have a little bit more more guideline in that aspect that we don't have

2840
04:59:06.120 --> 04:59:06.930
Orlando Sequera: with

2841
04:59:06.970 --> 04:59:11.820
Orlando Sequera: your with a predictive. So that's that's Why, we have

2842
04:59:11.840 --> 04:59:24.960
Orlando Sequera: constant engagement daily on a daily basis. We have the daily stand-up meeting for coordination it teams are working, Closely. So you have a better

2843
04:59:25.150 --> 04:59:26.420
Orlando Sequera: a more.

2844
04:59:26.860 --> 04:59:37.859
Orlando Sequera: They They involve many. It's on a daily basis. The product owner is working with a team on a daily basis. So do this near constant engagement what you have. If you're following a that approach. That's why.

2845
04:59:38.640 --> 04:59:40.440
Orlando Sequera: okay,

2846
04:59:49.260 --> 04:59:50.490
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2847
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:58.960
Orlando Sequera: Should a Pm. Be put in a copy of all emails a team sense. My sure answer is yes, ideally yes.

2848
05:00:03.100 --> 05:00:04.270
Orlando Sequera: and

2849
05:00:05.650 --> 05:00:09.849
Orlando Sequera: sharing live reports with stakeholders live via sharepoint?

2850
05:00:10.440 --> 05:00:17.210
Orlando Sequera: Or is it better to send a report snapshot on a regular schedule. My answer is, Ask your

2851
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:28.449
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders. What do they like? That's why we perform that communications requirement analysis. Ask your stakeholders. Do not assume what they want or what they like, ask them.

2852
05:00:29.050 --> 05:00:30.560
Orlando Sequera: and based on the answer.

2853
05:00:30.610 --> 05:00:31.870
Orlando Sequera: you go with

2854
05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:34.060
Orlando Sequera: their communication preference.

2855
05:00:38.590 --> 05:00:44.190
Orlando Sequera: Does the practice test question refer to which section of the boot camp it refers to. No.

2856
05:00:45.130 --> 05:00:47.859
Orlando Sequera: and neither. That's the Pmp. Exam.

2857
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:49.400
Orlando Sequera: Everything is

2858
05:00:49.470 --> 05:00:53.330
Orlando Sequera: everything that we cover is part of the content that you will be tested on

2859
05:00:57.150 --> 05:00:59.390
Orlando Sequera: what criteria

2860
05:01:06.000 --> 05:01:06.850
Orlando Sequera: meet.

2861
05:01:06.960 --> 05:01:11.900
Orlando Sequera: what criteria me the expectation of satisfy stakeholders and stakeholder engagement

2862
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:15.240
Orlando Sequera: that is based on

2863
05:01:15.450 --> 05:01:16.980
Orlando Sequera: your stakeholder

2864
05:01:17.050 --> 05:01:23.759
Orlando Sequera: analysis their communication preferences, so they again. They will provide that information for you.

2865
05:01:24.130 --> 05:01:25.040
Orlando Sequera: Ask them.

2866
05:01:25.760 --> 05:01:27.460
Orlando Sequera: and then try to meet

2867
05:01:27.580 --> 05:01:28.910
Orlando Sequera: that criteria.

2868
05:01:36.450 --> 05:01:43.289
Orlando Sequera: Do we get partial score? If we select any second priority option. The Pmp. Exam. Again. It's a password fail.

2869
05:01:43.640 --> 05:01:48.710
Orlando Sequera: Nobody knows, except pmi, how they score the exam, so

2870
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:54.820
Orlando Sequera: it's a passive Fill exam. The the short answer is, no one knows, outside of Pmi

2871
05:02:10.200 --> 05:02:16.099
Orlando Sequera: how to select the best option out of 2 good answers by starting and getting ready for the exam, and taking multiple

2872
05:02:16.420 --> 05:02:23.000
Orlando Sequera: as many as possible. Practice questions for the Pmp. Exam. And understanding these definitions, getting ready for the exam.

2873
05:02:25.640 --> 05:02:27.839
Orlando Sequera: what will be the best answer

2874
05:02:28.340 --> 05:02:33.409
Orlando Sequera: on the Pmp. If there are critical filters one should use

2875
05:02:33.490 --> 05:02:39.700
Orlando Sequera: you will have to elaborate on what you mean by critical filters. Always look for the best answer

2876
05:02:40.300 --> 05:02:43.469
Orlando Sequera: to this specific scenario that you are answering.

2877
05:02:43.770 --> 05:02:47.280
Orlando Sequera: based on this tools and techniques

2878
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:51.569
Orlando Sequera: that, and this content that we're covering these best practices that we're covering

2879
05:02:55.580 --> 05:02:56.740
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2880
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:27.589
Orlando Sequera: When will we know that we're ready for the Pmp. Exam. When you consistently start

2881
05:03:27.710 --> 05:03:31.480
Orlando Sequera: getting 80% or more in the simulators.

2882
05:03:32.590 --> 05:03:38.299
Orlando Sequera: That's a good indication. It's not always a guarantee, but it's a good indication. So rule of

2883
05:03:44.410 --> 05:03:48.649
Orlando Sequera: our test spread not limited to a number of trials. Nope. And you can take that as many

2884
05:03:49.660 --> 05:03:51.030
Orlando Sequera: time that's needed.

2885
05:03:59.370 --> 05:04:15.040
Orlando Sequera: Can you tell us again what is an artifact special document that we prepare for for our project. Right? Your stakeholder register. It's an example. Your word Breakdown structure is an example. Your risk register is an example of a of of an artifact.

2886
05:04:15.880 --> 05:04:29.780
Orlando Sequera: but documentation will be the emails that you send to your vendors training documentation, right? So in a way, they're similar to documentation. But they're a little bit more involved, is it? Think of it as

2887
05:04:33.120 --> 05:04:35.340
Orlando Sequera: instruments for a lack of a better work.

2888
05:04:35.490 --> 05:04:39.140
Orlando Sequera: To that you need to use in order to manage your project

2889
05:04:50.810 --> 05:04:51.730
Orlando Sequera: right?

2890
05:04:52.660 --> 05:04:57.810
Orlando Sequera: We are going to take a break, and when we come back we're going to continue with the content.

2891
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:59.970
Orlando Sequera: and

2892
05:05:00.550 --> 05:05:03.110
Orlando Sequera: we will. We will be back.

2893
05:05:10.260 --> 05:05:12.530
Orlando Sequera: We are back, and we are going to continue

2894
05:05:12.610 --> 05:05:13.490
Orlando Sequera: with

2895
05:05:14.060 --> 05:05:19.830
Orlando Sequera: the class. I was reviewing the Q. And a. But I don't really see that many

2896
05:05:20.210 --> 05:05:22.890
Orlando Sequera: questions that are content related. So we're going to continue.

2897
05:05:24.860 --> 05:05:26.240
Orlando Sequera: and we

2898
05:05:28.600 --> 05:05:32.789
Orlando Sequera: we talked about this. We talked about this for a communication

2899
05:05:32.920 --> 05:05:37.080
Orlando Sequera: matrix, and we we mentioned the importance of active listening

2900
05:05:37.360 --> 05:05:40.990
Orlando Sequera: and effective feedback, and we also talked about

2901
05:05:42.770 --> 05:05:48.589
Orlando Sequera: reports and formal communication, and also how to collaborate super important.

2902
05:05:50.220 --> 05:05:53.049
Orlando Sequera: And now we're going to talk about

2903
05:05:55.170 --> 05:05:58.749
Orlando Sequera: information radiators. This is

2904
05:05:59.220 --> 05:06:00.030
Orlando Sequera: for

2905
05:06:00.880 --> 05:06:06.070
Orlando Sequera: agile projects, and this artifact is going to help us to

2906
05:06:09.010 --> 05:06:13.229
Orlando Sequera: This is the artifact that we can use that is going to help us to

2907
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:14.280
Orlando Sequera: he

2908
05:06:14.700 --> 05:06:18.290
Orlando Sequera: all the work visible to any of our stakeholders

2909
05:06:18.850 --> 05:06:20.040
Orlando Sequera: since.

2910
05:06:20.290 --> 05:06:28.900
Orlando Sequera: and you might be wondering why Don't, we have the same approach that we have in predictive in which we have those styles meetings. There's not really

2911
05:06:29.700 --> 05:06:33.670
Orlando Sequera: time for that. We have to be as efficient as possible with the time.

2912
05:06:33.840 --> 05:06:34.700
Orlando Sequera: So

2913
05:06:35.420 --> 05:06:37.109
Orlando Sequera: for that reason.

2914
05:06:37.320 --> 05:06:40.210
Orlando Sequera: since we're working in this short iterations.

2915
05:06:40.260 --> 05:06:45.660
Orlando Sequera: it is a better idea to keep all that work, all the information visible.

2916
05:06:45.690 --> 05:06:46.470
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2917
05:06:46.500 --> 05:06:54.640
Orlando Sequera: An example of an information radiator is going to be a Camden board. We're going to watch a video in in less than 5, but

2918
05:06:55.290 --> 05:06:59.670
Orlando Sequera: just want to make sure that you understand that this is a a tool that is used in.

2919
05:06:59.840 --> 05:07:01.170
Orlando Sequera: Add your projects.

2920
05:07:01.330 --> 05:07:02.680
Orlando Sequera: Any shows

2921
05:07:03.330 --> 05:07:20.029
Orlando Sequera: this. It's a graphic representation of the work. We have multiple columns. We have the list of user stories that are in the to do list. We have. The team has to start to work on them. We have the list of user stories that are being worked on right now. What this, what

2922
05:07:20.040 --> 05:07:29.880
Orlando Sequera: the team is developing at this particular point we have another column. That might be the list of user stories or requirements or features that are being tested right now, that's another column, 200.

2923
05:07:29.940 --> 05:07:31.460
Orlando Sequera: Another column might be

2924
05:07:31.760 --> 05:07:46.640
Orlando Sequera: a your. They they list of user. Stories that are blocked. You might have some blocked items, and another column might be the list of features or user stories that are done. So. Anyone that would like to understand

2925
05:07:47.050 --> 05:07:54.919
Orlando Sequera: a the status of the project. You can refer them to the information radiator. That's how you save

2926
05:07:55.980 --> 05:08:03.700
Orlando Sequera: a time, and you are more efficient in providing status. You can refer them to to the information radiator, and they can get

2927
05:08:03.730 --> 05:08:05.210
Orlando Sequera: in real time

2928
05:08:05.310 --> 05:08:14.990
Orlando Sequera: information about the health of the project. They help with communication and collaboration. They they also, they can

2929
05:08:15.450 --> 05:08:23.030
Orlando Sequera: a help with innovation. They can start conversations and collaborations when they, when the stakeholders a

2930
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:25.839
Orlando Sequera: review it it

2931
05:08:25.860 --> 05:08:34.770
Orlando Sequera: you might be wondering how do, how do we? How do we do? How do we make this happen? How can we build an information radiator? Basically, there are 2 ways

2932
05:08:35.010 --> 05:08:39.019
Orlando Sequera: you can, if you, if your team is co-located, and this is

2933
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:47.150
Orlando Sequera: how many teams, and even to this day. Sometimes I still do do it that way. They build the information radiator in a whole way.

2934
05:08:47.460 --> 05:08:51.810
Orlando Sequera: right? That is close to the area.

2935
05:08:52.040 --> 05:08:59.600
Orlando Sequera: The location of the team, so anybody that can walk behind if they wanted to understand the status of the pro, they can.

2936
05:08:59.780 --> 05:09:10.879
Orlando Sequera: It's it's a low tech way of printing the information radiator. But that's going to be there in the whole way, so it's not a necessarily high tech, but nowadays most

2937
05:09:11.980 --> 05:09:30.890
Orlando Sequera: so are using tools like Jira, for example, version one a trello that allow you to create a digital version of an information radiator, and they give a access to any any stakeholder, and of course, the team members. So they

2938
05:09:31.320 --> 05:09:41.220
Orlando Sequera: a keep it updated for you, and if they work as the work gets done, the team members. They are the ones that are going to be a updating

2939
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:47.369
Orlando Sequera: the information radiator as the work gets done. This helps with

2940
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:56.569
Orlando Sequera: responsibility, with visibility, because all the members are going to. We're working on the same information radiator, and it keeps everything in the same place.

2941
05:09:58.260 --> 05:09:59.130
Okay.

2942
05:10:02.000 --> 05:10:03.010
Orlando Sequera: also.

2943
05:10:04.440 --> 05:10:07.150
Orlando Sequera: A. And this is for agile

2944
05:10:07.500 --> 05:10:11.310
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder collaboration happens on

2945
05:10:11.460 --> 05:10:13.490
Orlando Sequera: the basis in a major project

2946
05:10:14.450 --> 05:10:17.690
Orlando Sequera: we have agile has,

2947
05:10:18.220 --> 05:10:23.660
Orlando Sequera: as part of the approach has, or the framework has built in ceremonies that help

2948
05:10:23.810 --> 05:10:24.890
Orlando Sequera: with this

2949
05:10:24.960 --> 05:10:35.010
Orlando Sequera: a engagement that needs to happen on a daily basis. That's why we, the previous slice that we saw about communication planning were mostly geared towards

2950
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:42.609
Orlando Sequera: predictive. But in edge of this collaboration has to happen nearly it's nearly constant, so we have

2951
05:10:43.680 --> 05:10:45.450
Orlando Sequera: daily stand up meetings.

2952
05:10:46.880 --> 05:10:55.230
Orlando Sequera: Sure. These are not status meetings. As we learn, we ideally have our team members co-located, or

2953
05:10:55.260 --> 05:10:59.889
Orlando Sequera: A. If we don't have. If allocation is not a possibility.

2954
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:19.680
Orlando Sequera: we have the technology we have the tools to make sure that they're using all the proper tools to communicate closely. Microsoft team, for example, and you have your channels for your team. You have ways for them to communicate, and the the communication. The engagement is nearly constant.

2955
05:11:19.690 --> 05:11:25.530
Orlando Sequera: or you can have some schedule. You're gonna have also some scheduled sessions. You might go over

2956
05:11:25.650 --> 05:11:31.740
Orlando Sequera: milestone reviews, backlog refinement sessions to work with the product owner, to understand

2957
05:11:31.790 --> 05:11:32.860
Orlando Sequera: the scope.

2958
05:11:32.960 --> 05:11:36.000
Orlando Sequera: What in the per backlog

2959
05:11:36.300 --> 05:11:44.160
Orlando Sequera: get clarification on some items a make sure that this, that the product is prioritized, based on the

2960
05:11:44.330 --> 05:11:48.270
Orlando Sequera: features or user stories that add the most value to the business.

2961
05:11:48.420 --> 05:11:49.670
Orlando Sequera: A

2962
05:11:50.520 --> 05:12:06.540
Orlando Sequera: You might have a project update meetings as well, Nigel. They're not a only exclusive for predictive. It's possible to have them, even if you've following an imagined approach it. You also, for collaboration, have parent, which is put in a couple of

2963
05:12:06.810 --> 05:12:15.500
Orlando Sequera: team members working together. Maybe you can have a senior or well of

2964
05:12:16.530 --> 05:12:32.439
Orlando Sequera: An experience team member working with a team member. That is a a little bit more green. They're starting their career. You can do that that's for planning, coaching, and that works in order to transfer. And also another collaboration. Activity is going to be negotiation.

2965
05:12:37.880 --> 05:12:42.659
Orlando Sequera: Everything negotiation is very important. This is going to happen a lot.

2966
05:12:42.820 --> 05:12:45.099
Orlando Sequera: Everything is going to negotiate

2967
05:12:45.620 --> 05:12:51.619
Orlando Sequera: internally on daily work roles, a assignment, and so on.

2968
05:12:51.840 --> 05:12:53.830
Orlando Sequera: External communications

2969
05:12:53.880 --> 05:12:56.700
Orlando Sequera: can include contract negotiations

2970
05:12:57.070 --> 05:13:00.060
Orlando Sequera: with suppliers or vendors.

2971
05:13:00.160 --> 05:13:05.920
Orlando Sequera: or agreements with external stakeholders. So negotiations are going to happen, and think of them as

2972
05:13:05.980 --> 05:13:15.600
Orlando Sequera: conversations with either internal or external parties with the goal to reach an agreement. And again, when it comes to negotiation.

2973
05:13:15.810 --> 05:13:22.510
Orlando Sequera: the key word is going to be again communication. Make sure that you use communication methods

2974
05:13:22.790 --> 05:13:25.550
Orlando Sequera: to ensure collaboration with the other party.

2975
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:32.169
Orlando Sequera: because the goal is to reach consensus and ideally keep at keep a positive tone

2976
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:36.920
Orlando Sequera: to help increase the likelihood of success. So that's important.

2977
05:13:37.720 --> 05:13:40.220
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect of

2978
05:13:42.060 --> 05:13:43.900
Orlando Sequera: projects. You're gonna have

2979
05:13:44.000 --> 05:13:51.260
Orlando Sequera: multiple meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings. I know that some of you it might be

2980
05:13:52.100 --> 05:13:53.210
Orlando Sequera: A.

2981
05:13:53.280 --> 05:13:58.310
Orlando Sequera: It might be tired of so many meetings that we have. They are

2982
05:13:58.510 --> 05:14:01.260
Orlando Sequera: useful if they are manage

2983
05:14:01.360 --> 05:14:07.450
Orlando Sequera: properly, Meetings can be useful, and meeting management is important. A few things that

2984
05:14:07.590 --> 05:14:09.520
Orlando Sequera: I will recommend you to use

2985
05:14:09.890 --> 05:14:14.600
Orlando Sequera: is starts with being organized even before the meeting.

2986
05:14:15.470 --> 05:14:16.960
Orlando Sequera: Create an agenda.

2987
05:14:17.000 --> 05:14:18.690
Orlando Sequera: Send that agenda

2988
05:14:18.730 --> 05:14:19.570
Orlando Sequera: not

2989
05:14:19.610 --> 05:14:23.749
Orlando Sequera: half an hour before the meeting. Send the agenda a few days before the meeting.

2990
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:31.880
Orlando Sequera: A. Be specific with the purpose of the meeting. Make sure that you validate the audience.

2991
05:14:31.900 --> 05:14:35.280
Orlando Sequera: the participants that are going to be attending that meeting

2992
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:44.250
Orlando Sequera: I have been able to learn. I didn't know this before, but I was able to learn that

2993
05:14:44.380 --> 05:14:54.909
Orlando Sequera: there's another profession. I don't know if it's a new profession. Maybe not, but I didn't notice before, but I have learned that there are some professional meeting attenders.

2994
05:14:54.980 --> 05:15:03.210
Orlando Sequera: There are some people I don't know how they do it, but I have gotten to know a few professional meeting attendees

2995
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:06.140
Orlando Sequera: meeting attendees, so

2996
05:15:06.180 --> 05:15:11.459
Orlando Sequera: we want to make sure that we invite the right people for our meetings, so

2997
05:15:11.480 --> 05:15:14.480
Orlando Sequera: prepare the agenda, send it to.

2998
05:15:14.650 --> 05:15:21.239
Orlando Sequera: They brought the appropriate parties, make sure that they have a time to get ready for the meeting assign.

2999
05:15:21.490 --> 05:15:28.079
Orlando Sequera: if we need be assigned, some of the topics in the agenda to specific people. Give them time

3000
05:15:28.120 --> 05:15:30.659
Orlando Sequera: to prepare a

3001
05:15:31.090 --> 05:15:36.530
Orlando Sequera: time box. The discussions okay, By that we mean, if the meeting is

3002
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:40.810
Orlando Sequera: an hour long, stick to that hour or less

3003
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:43.809
Orlando Sequera: during the meeting during the meeting.

3004
05:15:44.220 --> 05:15:46.820
Orlando Sequera: Chances are that you're going to be the facilitator.

3005
05:15:48.480 --> 05:16:00.319
Orlando Sequera: and one important aspect of being a meeting facilitator is try to avoid digressing. Try to make sure that people are sticking to the topics that are being covered.

3006
05:16:00.360 --> 05:16:05.960
Orlando Sequera: and if you start having people that start going for rabbit host, and by that I mean

3007
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:24.439
Orlando Sequera: people that are starting going in different directions from the topics that are being covered during the meeting bring their attention back to the topics, and if you need to have separate meetings to go over those topics, make sure that you clarify that, and schedule those. But

3008
05:16:24.480 --> 05:16:27.399
Orlando Sequera: do not let the minutes to be derailed.

3009
05:16:27.450 --> 05:16:32.519
Orlando Sequera: That's a that's when meetings are not effective at all. Okay, so

3010
05:16:32.630 --> 05:16:37.739
Orlando Sequera: proper meeting meeting etiquette is is to follow. Then

3011
05:16:37.950 --> 05:16:39.810
Orlando Sequera: stick to the time duration.

3012
05:16:40.220 --> 05:16:42.280
Orlando Sequera: Do not go over

3013
05:16:42.510 --> 05:16:47.359
Orlando Sequera: people. You can give a few minutes back. If I don't possible a

3014
05:16:47.540 --> 05:16:51.869
Orlando Sequera: practice active listening to feedback and take many minutes.

3015
05:16:52.040 --> 05:16:53.989
Orlando Sequera: If you are

3016
05:16:54.110 --> 05:17:00.329
Orlando Sequera: the facilitator, and you don't have someone that Can you designate a subscribe to take me the minutes.

3017
05:17:00.410 --> 05:17:02.670
Orlando Sequera: then make sure that you at least

3018
05:17:03.360 --> 05:17:04.850
Orlando Sequera: are writing down

3019
05:17:05.500 --> 05:17:08.640
Orlando Sequera: the action items that need to

3020
05:17:08.680 --> 05:17:13.529
Orlando Sequera: that that will follow up after the meeting at the very least. But take meeting minutes

3021
05:17:13.630 --> 05:17:25.650
Orlando Sequera: document. Those made it minutes. In some cases you have the ability to record the meeting, but in some cases it's not going to be possible. Find out if that's a possibility that might help.

3022
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:37.759
Orlando Sequera: But please make sure that you have you designate someone to take many minutes, or if you're doing it, at least you capture the action. Items facilitate the collaboration, give people the chance to talk.

3023
05:17:37.880 --> 05:17:42.200
Orlando Sequera: to give people the chance to express their ideas and

3024
05:17:43.010 --> 05:17:44.580
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you

3025
05:17:44.680 --> 05:18:04.249
Orlando Sequera: adjourn the meeting properly, and follow up with those many minutes in action items so people can get ready for the next meeting, if need be. So they, if they are used properly. They're very effective, and people are going to. People are going to pay attention, and people are going to

3026
05:18:04.760 --> 05:18:19.499
Orlando Sequera: People are going to like to participate in your meetings. If you are, if you follow these guidelines, okay, and the team especially the team, because they might be the first one that that are a not really happy with those cleaning. So this is going.

3027
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:25.410
Orlando Sequera: But if they're used properly they're very powerful to together information that is needed. Okay.

3028
05:18:26.560 --> 05:18:28.680
Orlando Sequera: all right. And

3029
05:18:29.620 --> 05:18:32.289
Orlando Sequera: again, we have our

3030
05:18:32.410 --> 05:18:51.650
Orlando Sequera: theme or stakeholder engagement, assessment matrix, and we're trying to determine our day supporting our our project. Are they the tractors or the Sisters? Are they a neutral? We have that changes that changes that level of stakeholder engagement as a changes. So we have to update the same

3031
05:18:51.700 --> 05:18:59.679
Orlando Sequera: throughout the life cycle of the project a. Keep them engaged as needed. Remember that Ideally, we shouldn't Have anyone

3032
05:18:59.720 --> 05:19:00.720
Orlando Sequera: a

3033
05:19:01.160 --> 05:19:05.509
Orlando Sequera: against your project. We shouldn't Have your sisters, or we shouldn't have

3034
05:19:06.090 --> 05:19:07.480
Orlando Sequera: A detractors

3035
05:19:07.720 --> 05:19:18.979
Orlando Sequera: should at least have neutral stakeholders. Okay, so work with them. And what are the tools that we use? Well in a personal skills. Active, listening negotiation.

3036
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:27.680
Orlando Sequera: Use the emotional intelligence as as much as possible, and expertise to measure the level of engagement of your stakeholders.

3037
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:37.070
Orlando Sequera: And this is what we have covered. These are the topics that we have covered. We have talked about managing

3038
05:19:37.220 --> 05:19:43.910
Orlando Sequera: a communications, communicate project information and updates effectively. We also talked about

3039
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:50.919
Orlando Sequera: The importance of confirming that the message was the lever and understood, and the feedback was received.

3040
05:19:51.000 --> 05:19:53.260
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about leading the team.

3041
05:19:53.450 --> 05:20:03.119
Orlando Sequera: and, like team members of stakeholders influence engage in our stakeholders, collaborating with our stakeholders and being able to evaluate and deliver project benefits

3042
05:20:03.140 --> 05:20:04.780
Orlando Sequera: in value.

3043
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.920
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3044
05:20:06.400 --> 05:20:07.450
Orlando Sequera: Now

3045
05:20:07.480 --> 05:20:09.190
Orlando Sequera: we are going to

3046
05:20:10.650 --> 05:20:22.539
Orlando Sequera: talk about training, coaching and mentoring. Okay, so let's move away from collaboration. Now, we're going to talk about training our team members and our stakeholders as well.

3047
05:20:22.820 --> 05:20:30.340
Orlando Sequera: So this is about work being able to work together. Remember what I mentioned before. We are in the business of developing people.

3048
05:20:31.240 --> 05:20:44.720
Orlando Sequera: and ideally we should foster a knowledge sharing culture that's what's going to help us to be successful. Remember, we said before about a. It's ideally we we should have T-shaped people or generalized specialists.

3049
05:20:44.790 --> 05:20:55.370
Orlando Sequera: This is one way of achieving that goal. We should foster a knowledge sharing culture. Is knowledge. Hoarding is a major. No, no.

3050
05:20:55.810 --> 05:21:11.979
Orlando Sequera: we can have single points of failure. We don't want to have a knowledge Horden. It's not job security. It's a No, no. In this in this particular context. Okay, it's about knowledge sharing we should. It's about training the team help them to improve their skill set.

3051
05:21:12.170 --> 05:21:24.680
Orlando Sequera: We're always learning something new, coaching them with best practices, and they shouldn't happen as part of the project, and sometimes even outside of the project. So it is. It is important.

3052
05:21:24.810 --> 05:21:26.790
Orlando Sequera: Team members are going to learn from

3053
05:21:26.950 --> 05:21:31.289
Orlando Sequera: A from other team members, and they're going to teach other team members.

3054
05:21:31.390 --> 05:21:44.759
Orlando Sequera: This is for everyone. It's not just for the team members. It's also about the stakeholders, because if we can coach them to be better stakeholders, they can make best use of what we're producing for them with the with the

3055
05:21:44.920 --> 05:21:52.639
Orlando Sequera: with the project that ultimately it's going to be benef. It's going to benefit the organization. Okay, and that is part of continuous improvement.

3056
05:21:53.750 --> 05:22:04.610
Orlando Sequera: There are some project roles that are specifically dedicated to knowledge, sharing like agile coaches that help organizations and teams in their edge of transformation journeys.

3057
05:22:04.680 --> 05:22:07.730
Orlando Sequera: And this is crucial

3058
05:22:08.060 --> 05:22:23.500
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to product delivery. When we are transitioning our project into a live environment, and also helps with those transition planning efforts that we mentioned before. It's not just building the product service of result. We have to think

3059
05:22:23.770 --> 05:22:28.570
Orlando Sequera: beyond that. We have to also take into account the delivery aspect

3060
05:22:28.680 --> 05:22:47.700
Orlando Sequera: when and by that I mean, when our product service over salt, it's going to be transition to production, and the working session is going to start using it, whatever it is that we're producing, whether it is a software for the accounting department, a mobile app, or a new streaming service, or a

3061
05:22:47.710 --> 05:22:50.509
Orlando Sequera: anything, for that matter that we're building with our project

3062
05:22:52.040 --> 05:22:54.000
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to training

3063
05:22:54.720 --> 05:22:55.890
Orlando Sequera: and mentoring

3064
05:22:57.180 --> 05:23:06.260
Orlando Sequera: a training is very specific. It's about learning, a skill set to use in the present right? And you can do this individually.

3065
05:23:06.520 --> 05:23:08.390
Orlando Sequera: or you can do it as a group.

3066
05:23:08.700 --> 05:23:12.270
Orlando Sequera: It's also known as upscaling, and it could be in any

3067
05:23:12.440 --> 05:23:14.460
Orlando Sequera: on basically any topic.

3068
05:23:15.550 --> 05:23:17.830
Orlando Sequera: coaching is

3069
05:23:18.500 --> 05:23:20.230
Orlando Sequera: a little more involved.

3070
05:23:20.270 --> 05:23:22.150
Orlando Sequera: It's about sharing

3071
05:23:24.050 --> 05:23:27.450
Orlando Sequera: new skills or better ways of doing things.

3072
05:23:27.550 --> 05:23:29.749
Orlando Sequera: and it can also be

3073
05:23:30.600 --> 05:23:33.939
Orlando Sequera: it done in an individual fashion or as a group.

3074
05:23:34.120 --> 05:23:43.379
Orlando Sequera: and it's about putting learning into practice. But it's a little more long term than just training for me is for the present coaching.

3075
05:23:43.560 --> 05:24:02.580
Orlando Sequera: You have a relationship building element that makes it a little more long term compared to training You're building relationships through training and mentoring even more so. Mentoring is long term relationships. It's about building

3076
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:18.730
Orlando Sequera: It's about professional growth over time when people have mentors and mentees that learn from people that are highly trained, specialized, and their subject matter experts in the organization with specific topic.

3077
05:24:18.740 --> 05:24:35.050
Orlando Sequera: They can work with these people that are new to that discipline or field, and they would like to learn. But it's about relationship building. And this goes beyond the project. Okay, so it's a long term relationship. So those are the main differences between

3078
05:24:35.150 --> 05:24:49.759
Orlando Sequera: training coaching and mentoring in the project management. Usually the first 2. Those are the ones that occur. It's about training. Remember that chances are that you're not going to have a 100%. The skill set

3079
05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:57.320
Orlando Sequera: present on day, one with your team members. It's okay. You can work with them to train them.

3080
05:24:57.940 --> 05:25:02.769
Orlando Sequera: and also coaching in best practices. That also happens in project management.

3081
05:25:03.900 --> 05:25:05.860
Orlando Sequera: How to acquire

3082
05:25:05.960 --> 05:25:07.940
Orlando Sequera: that require competencies

3083
05:25:10.110 --> 05:25:16.760
Orlando Sequera: once everyone is aware of their starting points, and conscious of what unique knowledge or skill set they're going to need.

3084
05:25:16.840 --> 05:25:18.470
Orlando Sequera: It is time to act.

3085
05:25:18.570 --> 05:25:20.580
Orlando Sequera: Remember, we are in

3086
05:25:20.640 --> 05:25:22.159
Orlando Sequera: the business of

3087
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:25.430
Orlando Sequera: growing and developing people. So

3088
05:25:25.540 --> 05:25:41.029
Orlando Sequera: work on understanding. What type of training do the team members need, or the stakeholders so take into account the topic the death of the the training, the schedule, the format, and then

3089
05:25:41.520 --> 05:25:43.140
Orlando Sequera: the training has to.

3090
05:25:43.400 --> 05:25:50.469
Orlando Sequera: Again, the customers business culture you got to take into account. They desire out comes to the training and

3091
05:25:50.700 --> 05:25:53.789
Orlando Sequera: also within the project context

3092
05:25:54.020 --> 05:25:56.420
Orlando Sequera: and encourage mentorships. Okay.

3093
05:25:58.140 --> 05:26:01.040
Orlando Sequera: you have to plan for this training.

3094
05:26:03.210 --> 05:26:08.840
Orlando Sequera: You start by performing a gap analysis to understand those training gaps that you might have

3095
05:26:09.790 --> 05:26:11.149
Orlando Sequera: plan for

3096
05:26:12.300 --> 05:26:16.450
Orlando Sequera: suitable diversity of training and coaching offerings. So

3097
05:26:16.630 --> 05:26:22.170
Orlando Sequera: people can understand when

3098
05:26:22.710 --> 05:26:28.160
Orlando Sequera: So you. You have a combination of soft skills and time your skills, and this can be a way also

3099
05:26:28.560 --> 05:26:32.849
Orlando Sequera: to build trust with the team to to for team building.

3100
05:26:33.060 --> 05:26:36.920
Orlando Sequera: The timing of the training is super important.

3101
05:26:37.140 --> 05:26:41.529
Orlando Sequera: One brutal fund is, and this is one recommendation. Training

3102
05:26:41.630 --> 05:26:53.369
Orlando Sequera: on your implementation should be done as close as possible at the last responsible moment prior to implementation. Why is that? Let's assume for a minute that we're talking about

3103
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:59.870
Orlando Sequera: the software that we're developing for the accounting department. The training that the users can.

3104
05:27:00.080 --> 05:27:10.189
Orlando Sequera: prior to our deployment to production when that software for the coming department goes, live should occur as close as possible to deployment

3105
05:27:10.250 --> 05:27:11.900
Orlando Sequera: when we go live.

3106
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:18.140
Orlando Sequera: Otherwise people are going to forget, and the training is not going to be as effective.

3107
05:27:18.260 --> 05:27:21.379
Orlando Sequera: In some cases. You might need to

3108
05:27:22.300 --> 05:27:26.779
Orlando Sequera: try going back to your team members. Do you mind me to train your team members to be certified

3109
05:27:26.800 --> 05:27:36.340
Orlando Sequera: it to have specific certifications? That's Why, you see here a. The Pmp. Pmiacp, etc. Those are examples of certifications.

3110
05:27:36.510 --> 05:27:37.320
Orlando Sequera: but

3111
05:27:38.560 --> 05:27:47.270
Orlando Sequera: it it might be other types of certifications that they need make sure. And I can tell you, for example, in in Aerospace

3112
05:27:47.440 --> 05:27:54.900
Orlando Sequera: Beef, those are engineers that were sitting in console when when we launch Artemis one, for example.

3113
05:27:55.480 --> 05:28:15.110
Orlando Sequera: to be sailing, console. You have to go through a lot of certifications. You have to have that in place, and you have to take that into account in your project project planning efforts for training. Make sure that they get frame and they get certified before they can sit on console. In this case. Okay, you got to take that into account and try to encourage

3114
05:28:15.170 --> 05:28:18.960
Orlando Sequera: mentorship with some value stakeholders that can help others.

3115
05:28:20.630 --> 05:28:23.139
Orlando Sequera: It is also important to know

3116
05:28:23.280 --> 05:28:26.720
Orlando Sequera: the value of training, coaching and mentoring

3117
05:28:27.390 --> 05:28:36.939
Orlando Sequera: a try to perform a cost, benefit analysis, to understand the value and training because a couple of implications you may be wondering, oh, great!

3118
05:28:37.080 --> 05:28:37.740
Orlando Sequera: But

3119
05:28:37.760 --> 05:28:54.100
Orlando Sequera: how how can this training come to friction? Is it going to affect my my budget? And this is going to affect my schedule? And the answer is, yes, that's why we're planning for it. Put You need to conduct the cost, benefit analysis to justify the training, he said.

3120
05:28:54.110 --> 05:28:59.990
Orlando Sequera: Worth training, or is it better to hire someone that already has that knowledge

3121
05:29:00.140 --> 05:29:10.739
Orlando Sequera: you get up in? In some? In some cases the answer is going to be, it's gonna the the learning curve is very steep, so it's better to go with someone that already has the knowledge.

3122
05:29:11.070 --> 05:29:15.419
Orlando Sequera: a help, others, or yourself to improve your skills and knowledge.

3123
05:29:15.810 --> 05:29:30.129
Orlando Sequera: This is gonna by coaching, training and mentoring. You're going to increase the team's ability to increase the quality output and value, and it's going to help you in building thrust and relationships between stakeholders and team members.

3124
05:29:36.380 --> 05:29:48.689
Orlando Sequera: Hey, have you ever had a valuable trainer, coach, or mentor? I'm going to venture to say that the answer is yes. In 99.9% of the cases for you. So it is important to leverage that as much as possible.

3125
05:29:48.740 --> 05:29:49.690
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3126
05:29:50.210 --> 05:29:51.820
Orlando Sequera: a few elements

3127
05:29:52.630 --> 05:29:55.030
Orlando Sequera: that are associated with training.

3128
05:29:55.610 --> 05:29:59.809
Orlando Sequera: Framing can be done in multiple ways. You can provide

3129
05:30:00.050 --> 05:30:06.669
Orlando Sequera: train into individuals, you can provide train to groups. These can be small groups or they can be large

3130
05:30:07.090 --> 05:30:12.699
Orlando Sequera: it you can cover pretty much any topic may managerial, technical, or administrative.

3131
05:30:12.870 --> 05:30:23.530
Orlando Sequera: and the way trainings are delivered nowadays we have multiple flavors for that. It can be an instructor left classroom. It can be a virtual classroom like this One can be self-paced

3132
05:30:23.700 --> 05:30:30.310
Orlando Sequera: through e-learning document reviews, interactive simulations, or on the job trainings. Think about

3133
05:30:30.540 --> 05:30:31.990
Orlando Sequera: the delivery models.

3134
05:30:32.180 --> 05:30:34.740
Orlando Sequera: My recommendation is for your projects.

3135
05:30:35.210 --> 05:30:42.650
Orlando Sequera: Use more than one. Don't. Rely just on this is a common pitfall that I have seen is that we

3136
05:30:42.690 --> 05:30:50.199
Orlando Sequera: work with the team in creating documentation, and we gave a documentation to to the stakeholders, and that's it well self-paced.

3137
05:30:50.340 --> 05:30:51.980
Orlando Sequera: A document review.

3138
05:30:52.120 --> 05:30:59.579
Orlando Sequera: We posted the document, the documentation a we uploaded that to sharepoint. Here it is, Mr.

3139
05:30:59.650 --> 05:31:17.019
Orlando Sequera: And Mr. Customer Misses customer. There you go. You're You're trained. Read the document, and you're trained. No, Some cases they're depending on what it is. That's that's gonna work in some situations, but depending on the complexity of the service product or result that we're delivering with our project, we have to use

3140
05:31:17.370 --> 05:31:26.440
Orlando Sequera: other modalities right? It could be train the trainer to be a virtual classroom, Whatever works for our specific situation.

3141
05:31:27.260 --> 05:31:28.280
Orlando Sequera: a

3142
05:31:28.370 --> 05:31:33.320
Orlando Sequera: also coach, the team coaching teams and individuals and project management.

3143
05:31:34.360 --> 05:31:35.220
Orlando Sequera: a

3144
05:31:36.180 --> 05:31:45.029
Orlando Sequera: try to pay attention to informal opportunities, delegate tasks, even in product management, to help them to grow, encourage others to take lead.

3145
05:31:45.260 --> 05:31:46.100
Orlando Sequera: or

3146
05:31:46.780 --> 05:32:06.280
Orlando Sequera: from collaboration for the management tasks. I do that. So our team members learn a little bit about the importance of project management. Some of them can be a neo-fy when they comes to project management, but it is a good practice to let them get a little bit of a of a taste of what, for example.

3147
05:32:06.290 --> 05:32:11.069
Orlando Sequera: So that's a informal way of doing it, or have for more opportunities for

3148
05:32:11.300 --> 05:32:12.410
Orlando Sequera: a coaching

3149
05:32:12.450 --> 05:32:14.410
Orlando Sequera: facilitate meetings and sessions.

3150
05:32:14.520 --> 05:32:20.770
Orlando Sequera: transfer skills by parent individuals. Usually someone that has a lot of experience with someone that has less experience

3151
05:32:20.810 --> 05:32:23.420
Orlando Sequera: and more importantly modeled behaviors.

3152
05:32:25.040 --> 05:32:36.280
Orlando Sequera: Coaching group of groups and and individuals. As I mentioned before, you can work with the whole team. You can coach the individual, and then.

3153
05:32:37.410 --> 05:32:39.450
Orlando Sequera: if this is for agile

3154
05:32:40.090 --> 05:32:44.250
Orlando Sequera: whole thing coaching during iteration, planning at the beginning of the iteration.

3155
05:32:45.610 --> 05:32:49.549
Orlando Sequera: coaching helps individuals to the Well of Agile and from the solving skills.

3156
05:32:50.240 --> 05:32:53.919
Orlando Sequera: And then, at the end of the iteration, you have

3157
05:32:54.310 --> 05:32:56.160
Orlando Sequera: another session for

3158
05:32:56.500 --> 05:33:05.519
Orlando Sequera: coaching the entire team during the retrospective, which is another ceremony that occurs at the end of the iteration in which we go over lessons, learn

3159
05:33:06.060 --> 05:33:07.290
Orlando Sequera: a

3160
05:33:09.210 --> 05:33:11.720
Orlando Sequera: that we.

3161
05:33:12.090 --> 05:33:14.809
Orlando Sequera: in that particular iteration. What one will.

3162
05:33:15.280 --> 05:33:26.980
Orlando Sequera: what, when run, what can be improved? Okay. Multiple opportunities, regardless of the approach. This is applicable to agile and predictive, a coaching, mentoring and training.

3163
05:33:28.880 --> 05:33:30.570
Orlando Sequera: How do

3164
05:33:32.060 --> 05:33:35.809
Orlando Sequera: self-organizing teams collaborate self-organizing

3165
05:33:35.840 --> 05:33:39.090
Orlando Sequera: code for agile so we're talking about agile

3166
05:33:39.250 --> 05:33:49.620
Orlando Sequera: e we have to encourage teams agile teams to self organize. We've not telling them what to do. They have to be self-organized and take initiative

3167
05:33:50.640 --> 05:33:56.679
Orlando Sequera: coach individuals on how to contribute with other project rose like the product Owner, for example.

3168
05:33:56.710 --> 05:33:58.830
Orlando Sequera: coach an individual with

3169
05:33:58.860 --> 05:34:00.350
Orlando Sequera: That's it. Knowledge

3170
05:34:00.400 --> 05:34:02.190
Orlando Sequera: that it Knowledge is

3171
05:34:02.710 --> 05:34:08.859
Orlando Sequera: personal knowledge that can be difficult to articulate. It's also known as tribal knowledge.

3172
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:25.419
Orlando Sequera: This is about experience. This is about insights. This is of our beliefs. An example. Does it knowledge? Learning how to drive right? It's you. You learn by doing so. There are some things that are harder to the hard to articulate so. But nonetheless there's still knowledge.

3173
05:34:25.930 --> 05:34:30.149
Orlando Sequera: So coach and individual with tested knowledge, use, serve and leadership.

3174
05:34:30.360 --> 05:34:32.070
Orlando Sequera: You drop shadowing.

3175
05:34:32.120 --> 05:34:35.420
Orlando Sequera: coaching, or mentoring during transitions. So you

3176
05:34:35.770 --> 05:34:37.490
Orlando Sequera: knowledge and skills.

3177
05:34:38.130 --> 05:34:43.110
Orlando Sequera: That's when we are deploying to the live environment.

3178
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:45.000
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3179
05:34:47.540 --> 05:34:55.910
Orlando Sequera: another important aspect we have. After the training is perform, we have to show value for the for the training

3180
05:34:56.060 --> 05:35:00.570
Orlando Sequera: we have to be able to for to perform a post-training performance assessment

3181
05:35:01.050 --> 05:35:07.229
Orlando Sequera: to justify the investment. We're spending money on time on the training so we gotta get our return on investment.

3182
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:13.469
Orlando Sequera: We do that for post-training performance, assessments, observation of knowledge and skill, improvement

3183
05:35:13.490 --> 05:35:17.950
Orlando Sequera: showing the certifications right. If we got if we needed to get Pmp. Certified.

3184
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:26.749
Orlando Sequera: Here we go we are Pmp. Certified and have a retrospective session to go over the training outcomes. The lessons, learn

3185
05:35:26.770 --> 05:35:27.590
Orlando Sequera: and

3186
05:35:27.650 --> 05:35:33.320
Orlando Sequera: always try to convert the learning into active use of knowledge.

3187
05:35:33.440 --> 05:35:34.130
Okay.

3188
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:36.750
Orlando Sequera: And if the desired outcomes were not achieved.

3189
05:35:36.800 --> 05:35:43.320
Orlando Sequera: use the retrospective document that outcome and try to find out the reason for that.

3190
05:35:45.080 --> 05:35:49.620
Orlando Sequera: It's also important to keep the mentorships

3191
05:35:50.170 --> 05:35:54.599
Orlando Sequera: longer term partnerships. They're going to enable professional growth.

3192
05:35:54.830 --> 05:35:58.499
Orlando Sequera: This is, connects. Mentorship is long term, as we said.

3193
05:35:58.560 --> 05:36:08.689
Orlando Sequera: a job shadow in engagement. They help with transfer of explicit knowledge that one we can articulate right. We can put that in a document and t it. Knowledge

3194
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:15.400
Orlando Sequera: that one is that type of knowledge is transfer through experiences, Tribal knowledge. You learn by doing.

3195
05:36:15.870 --> 05:36:19.919
Orlando Sequera: You have to tailor the the context and desire engagement

3196
05:36:20.550 --> 05:36:31.449
Orlando Sequera: to your organization. Some organizations have mentorship programs in place. NASA has it, and multiple private sector organizations have mentorship programs in place that help

3197
05:36:31.650 --> 05:36:42.450
Orlando Sequera: A, for example, to train project managers and they help, they may use reporting to guide development. What? What other organizations they follow a more informal approach.

3198
05:36:43.280 --> 05:36:44.420
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3199
05:36:45.570 --> 05:36:49.390
Orlando Sequera: What have we cover so far? We talked about building the team.

3200
05:36:49.480 --> 05:36:50.850
Orlando Sequera: We talked about

3201
05:36:51.200 --> 05:36:55.340
Orlando Sequera: making sure that our team members and stakeholders are properly trained.

3202
05:36:55.620 --> 05:37:07.850
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you remember that we have to plan for this training, and this training is going to have an impact on our budget, and also an impact on our schedule. And should not one thing that I didn't mention is important for training.

3203
05:37:08.110 --> 05:37:24.930
Orlando Sequera: Having a training should not be a reason for you, for example, to extend the schedule of your project. That's why we have to take it into account in our planning efforts. Okay, this is not a justification. Oh, we have to train our users. We're going to have to to extend the schedule

3204
05:37:24.990 --> 05:37:31.479
Orlando Sequera: for 3 more weeks. No, that's poor project management. You don't want to do that. You have to

3205
05:37:31.560 --> 05:37:33.510
Orlando Sequera: incorporate training

3206
05:37:33.890 --> 05:37:36.269
Orlando Sequera: in your planning efforts. Okay.

3207
05:37:36.320 --> 05:37:39.680
Orlando Sequera: And you also gotta work on mentoring relevant stakeholders.

3208
05:37:39.950 --> 05:37:42.309
Orlando Sequera: So that's what we have covered so far.

3209
05:37:42.840 --> 05:37:47.410
Orlando Sequera: Having said that we are going to move on to the next topic, and then

3210
05:37:47.700 --> 05:37:51.489
Orlando Sequera: this topic is important, and then i'm going to work on, addressing

3211
05:37:51.680 --> 05:37:53.590
Orlando Sequera: any questions that you might have

3212
05:37:55.500 --> 05:38:02.339
Orlando Sequera: conflict management super important for the Exempt. You should expect questions related to conflict management

3213
05:38:02.620 --> 05:38:05.070
Orlando Sequera: in your exam. Probably more than one.

3214
05:38:05.590 --> 05:38:07.630
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you are

3215
05:38:07.810 --> 05:38:14.129
Orlando Sequera: well, first of all paying attention right now, and also sharp when it comes to conflict management. Okay.

3216
05:38:15.790 --> 05:38:18.490
Orlando Sequera: and let's start with conflict. Why

3217
05:38:18.740 --> 05:38:20.710
Orlando Sequera: conflict manager matters?

3218
05:38:21.140 --> 05:38:26.799
Orlando Sequera: Let me start by saying that conflict is unavoidable. You're not going to be able to

3219
05:38:27.220 --> 05:38:34.310
Orlando Sequera: avoid conflict. You're working with people. Conflict is going to happen. But basically we are going to have

3220
05:38:34.330 --> 05:38:36.010
Orlando Sequera: 2 types of conflict

3221
05:38:36.180 --> 05:38:37.310
Orlando Sequera: we have

3222
05:38:38.010 --> 05:38:40.280
Orlando Sequera: good or positive conflict.

3223
05:38:41.660 --> 05:38:49.770
Orlando Sequera: and that we also know, and the formal, the formal name of positive or good conflict is functional conflict.

3224
05:38:50.230 --> 05:38:53.970
Orlando Sequera: And this is the conflict that occurs when.

3225
05:38:56.070 --> 05:39:00.939
Orlando Sequera: for example, when the team members are going through the storming face

3226
05:39:01.320 --> 05:39:02.710
Orlando Sequera: and they have

3227
05:39:03.780 --> 05:39:11.659
Orlando Sequera: they, there are some conflict situations during storming, and they trying to exert power, and they say, Well, in my previous project

3228
05:39:11.860 --> 05:39:14.249
Orlando Sequera: during the shuttle days we did it.

3229
05:39:14.280 --> 05:39:27.080
Orlando Sequera: We solve that problem this way. But then you have Team Member B. That is saying No. But remember, this is different. I have work. When I in my days in Spacex. We solve that same problem

3230
05:39:27.740 --> 05:39:28.710
Orlando Sequera: that way

3231
05:39:28.790 --> 05:39:32.470
Orlando Sequera: totally different. So that's conflict. That's a comfort. Right?

3232
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:36.650
Orlando Sequera: They're they're brought in. H: that's that's a conflict. Right. There, but

3233
05:39:36.730 --> 05:39:38.100
Orlando Sequera: is conflict.

3234
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:46.420
Orlando Sequera: It's functional conflict. It's okay. Functional conflict is okay. Not all conflict is back. Not all conflict is negative

3235
05:39:46.750 --> 05:39:49.740
Orlando Sequera: negative conflict is When

3236
05:39:50.820 --> 05:39:56.610
Orlando Sequera: this situation or bad conflict. Negative conflict is when the conflict is about

3237
05:39:56.860 --> 05:40:06.340
Orlando Sequera: something personal when it's taken to a personal level, and we call that this functional conflict, that type of conflict has no room

3238
05:40:06.380 --> 05:40:08.340
Orlando Sequera: in the workplace period.

3239
05:40:08.410 --> 05:40:19.260
Orlando Sequera: that is, there's no room for that that is not allowed, and that is usually addressed with the simpler sanctions. When it comes to this functional conflict, we shouldn't. Let

3240
05:40:19.950 --> 05:40:23.390
Orlando Sequera: functional conflict to escalate, to become

3241
05:40:23.420 --> 05:40:29.750
Orlando Sequera: this functional conflict, because it can happen, if we are not effective in our conflict. Management

3242
05:40:30.020 --> 05:40:31.050
Orlando Sequera: approach.

3243
05:40:31.470 --> 05:40:37.860
Orlando Sequera: Functional conflict can escalate, can evolve to this functional conflict. And that's where

3244
05:40:38.760 --> 05:40:51.950
Orlando Sequera: this destructive behavior that we're seeing here occurs, animosity occurs and people can work together, and that's a morale killer and also a productivity killer. So we have to be on top of

3245
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:58.739
Orlando Sequera: a conflict. May situations watching like hawks on top of it, keeping a poll speed of any

3246
05:40:58.770 --> 05:41:11.590
Orlando Sequera: of any conflict situation. But remember, not all conflict is Pat so effective. Conflict management is going to help you with build a better understanding, better performance and also higher productivity.

3247
05:41:11.620 --> 05:41:12.340
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3248
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:19.950
Orlando Sequera: as a server leader, you assist in removing impediments or sources of conflict.

3249
05:41:20.010 --> 05:41:27.850
Orlando Sequera: Okay, imagined projects. The team lead is come, team, leader, scrum, master. It's going to facilitate conflict resolution, sessions.

3250
05:41:28.430 --> 05:41:39.099
Orlando Sequera: or that a for the team it. But the team is empowered to resolve conflicts as they best see fit, because agile teams are self-organize themselves, Manage

3251
05:41:40.160 --> 05:41:43.060
Orlando Sequera: what are the roles when it comes to conflict management.

3252
05:41:45.080 --> 05:41:46.079
Orlando Sequera: The first.

3253
05:41:46.490 --> 05:41:48.370
Orlando Sequera: the first name

3254
05:41:48.540 --> 05:41:52.969
Orlando Sequera: bullet point that we see here. Everyone is responsible for managing conflict.

3255
05:41:53.110 --> 05:41:53.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3256
05:41:54.280 --> 05:42:01.870
Orlando Sequera: it's not always up to the project manager. We can influence. We can help, and being servant leaders to help the team. But

3257
05:42:02.170 --> 05:42:10.689
Orlando Sequera: everything starts with the parties that are involved in the conflict situation. If that doesn't work that's when we as project managers can

3258
05:42:10.840 --> 05:42:14.339
Orlando Sequera: a step in and help the team in solving

3259
05:42:14.380 --> 05:42:25.030
Orlando Sequera: a the conflict situation, address in the conflict situation, it using our inner personal skills, active, listening, emotional intelligence, etc. And our server leadership approach

3260
05:42:25.150 --> 05:42:29.489
Orlando Sequera: in module teams. The team is in power to resolve conflicts, but

3261
05:42:29.850 --> 05:42:34.690
Orlando Sequera: in some cases, if need be, the team lead can facilitate the resolution.

3262
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:35.590
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3263
05:42:36.740 --> 05:42:38.760
Orlando Sequera: where this conflict come from.

3264
05:42:40.700 --> 05:42:53.980
Orlando Sequera: These are the common causes. It might be competition. That's why we have to instill and drive that awareness about there's no I in team. It's about team commitments, not individual commitments.

3265
05:42:54.050 --> 05:42:59.929
Orlando Sequera: It might also come from different sensing objectives, values, and perceptions.

3266
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:19.490
Orlando Sequera: That's why we have to work on making sure that we we define, we create our project, charter. We define our values as a team, and we're all on the same page the next one. When we have this agreements about road requirements, work activities and individual approaches. That's why we create a racing matrix.

3267
05:43:19.500 --> 05:43:22.490
Orlando Sequera: To prevent this from happening, we provide Cardi

3268
05:43:22.710 --> 05:43:28.260
Orlando Sequera: with the racing matrix. We create a race matrix to avoid as much as possible this

3269
05:43:28.680 --> 05:43:32.329
Orlando Sequera: type of conflict, because it it's very common. It's very common

3270
05:43:32.470 --> 05:43:45.620
Orlando Sequera: to avoid another cost of config communication breakdowns. That's why we're creating a communication management plan. That's why we train a communication strategy. That's why we have been naming communication so many times throughout the content.

3271
05:43:45.840 --> 05:43:54.649
Orlando Sequera: The conting for this Pmp preparation class, and we also need to keep in mind that projects are unique by nature, by definition.

3272
05:43:54.690 --> 05:44:01.699
Orlando Sequera: and in some cases this thing members have not worked together before, so that might be another cause of conflict.

3273
05:44:01.790 --> 05:44:17.450
Orlando Sequera: So we have to be able to address that we might be navigating a lot of complexity that that drives anxiety. So we have to work on addressing those situations. This is unavoidable. It's going to happen. We can try to minimize it.

3274
05:44:17.490 --> 05:44:18.270
Orlando Sequera: but

3275
05:44:18.520 --> 05:44:21.800
Orlando Sequera: it is going to happen when you work with people

3276
05:44:22.970 --> 05:44:24.000
Orlando Sequera: A

3277
05:44:24.700 --> 05:44:25.990
Orlando Sequera: in a. If If

3278
05:44:26.050 --> 05:44:32.640
Orlando Sequera: we have also been saying that we need to build and foster a psychologically safe environment that's

3279
05:44:32.660 --> 05:44:34.830
Orlando Sequera: also gonna help when it comes to

3280
05:44:34.990 --> 05:44:38.430
Orlando Sequera: a manage conflict in a positive way.

3281
05:44:38.610 --> 05:44:41.769
Orlando Sequera: If we're working a psychological, safe work, environment.

3282
05:44:41.940 --> 05:44:46.780
Orlando Sequera: the disruption and innovation, we view this disruption and innovation as connected.

3283
05:44:46.860 --> 05:44:50.570
Orlando Sequera: We encourage exchanges in this agreement, and we prevent

3284
05:44:50.910 --> 05:44:54.420
Orlando Sequera: to conflict, to go from functional to this functional.

3285
05:44:55.060 --> 05:44:57.660
Orlando Sequera: How can we manage conflict.

3286
05:45:00.210 --> 05:45:03.030
Orlando Sequera: We use prefer ways

3287
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:08.739
Orlando Sequera: of managing conflict from the team, charter and ground rules. This is why we create

3288
05:45:08.770 --> 05:45:21.780
Orlando Sequera: our team charter and on our ground rules to help us to manage conflict as much as possible. They give us guidance. So this is if we're following a predictive approach. If we're following an agile approach.

3289
05:45:21.800 --> 05:45:41.389
Orlando Sequera: Agile teams they also have. They specified their conflict management strategies in their way of working, and they are supported by a culture of trust. So the goal is to when you're managing conflict. This there's a key aspect. You gotta focus on the issue, not on the individuals, not on the people is.

3290
05:45:41.460 --> 05:45:43.680
Orlando Sequera: you have to focus on the issues.

3291
05:45:44.640 --> 05:45:45.620
Orlando Sequera: A:

3292
05:45:46.780 --> 05:45:49.799
Orlando Sequera: This is an all. This is a representation of

3293
05:45:50.600 --> 05:45:56.579
Orlando Sequera: the different levels of conflicts. This is, there's an author. His name is Speed Lease.

3294
05:45:56.750 --> 05:46:14.740
Orlando Sequera: A. He created many, many years ago. I think he was back in the sixties. If i'm not mistaken, he created this model of the levels of conflict. Okay and conflict can I can intensify it can go from a problem to solve. So right here

3295
05:46:15.300 --> 05:46:21.549
Orlando Sequera: we are in levels one and 2, a problem to solve on this agreement. That is functional conflict.

3296
05:46:21.580 --> 05:46:22.510
Orlando Sequera: But

3297
05:46:23.180 --> 05:46:28.370
Orlando Sequera: we can let it escalate because it's going to go from level

3298
05:46:28.580 --> 05:46:40.170
Orlando Sequera: if it goes all the way to level 3. This is where people are taking sides. Then it starts becoming personal. Do you? Do you want to handle conflict

3299
05:46:40.270 --> 05:46:43.230
Orlando Sequera: in these 2 levels ideally in the first one.

3300
05:46:43.430 --> 05:46:48.870
Orlando Sequera: Keep it in the first one problem to solve, maybe possibly a disagreement.

3301
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:49.780
Orlando Sequera: But

3302
05:46:49.800 --> 05:46:54.130
Orlando Sequera: you do not. It it starts becoming personal and even at the disagreement level it.

3303
05:46:54.350 --> 05:47:03.279
Orlando Sequera: So we that is dangerous. Okay, so ideally, most conflict has to be resolved here in this level one. We kind of let it go all the way up to

3304
05:47:04.860 --> 05:47:09.890
Orlando Sequera: it on flight. That is intervention here. You need hr

3305
05:47:10.170 --> 05:47:25.969
Orlando Sequera: a already it's it beyond beyond fixing, and then 5. This is where this. This is also known as war, by the way, and people are incapable of having a clear understanding of issues. They are trying to destroy others, and

3306
05:47:25.980 --> 05:47:30.679
Orlando Sequera: this is not allowed in the workplace. So you get a dress conflict here.

3307
05:47:31.180 --> 05:47:32.990
Orlando Sequera: ideally in level one.

3308
05:47:33.010 --> 05:47:33.680
Okay.

3309
05:47:33.840 --> 05:47:36.809
Orlando Sequera: Otherwise you're going to be in trouble.

3310
05:47:38.110 --> 05:47:40.739
Orlando Sequera: And what can you use to

3311
05:47:40.760 --> 05:47:44.320
Orlando Sequera: manage conflict? Do you use emotional intelligence.

3312
05:47:44.640 --> 05:47:48.260
Orlando Sequera: especially empathy, to understand? And the few situations.

3313
05:47:48.740 --> 05:47:50.879
Orlando Sequera: You used your leadership

3314
05:47:51.570 --> 05:47:55.700
Orlando Sequera: to your others in a more positive direction, decision making

3315
05:47:55.900 --> 05:48:00.170
Orlando Sequera: active, listening. Listen for personalize a

3316
05:48:00.190 --> 05:48:07.879
Orlando Sequera: accusing language and better classic tone that's look! Pay attention to that. Try to minimize that as much as possible.

3317
05:48:07.940 --> 05:48:09.060
Orlando Sequera: a

3318
05:48:09.170 --> 05:48:10.330
Orlando Sequera: influencing

3319
05:48:10.350 --> 05:48:19.949
Orlando Sequera: You have to try to do your best to persuade parties to reconsider or change your tone, approach or mindset, and when it comes to

3320
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:23.559
Orlando Sequera: conflict management we also have some recommended

3321
05:48:25.170 --> 05:48:30.970
Orlando Sequera: tools and techniques that will help you to manage conflict. There are some techniques.

3322
05:48:31.200 --> 05:48:32.390
Orlando Sequera: of course

3323
05:48:32.410 --> 05:48:34.140
Orlando Sequera: they depend on

3324
05:48:34.180 --> 05:48:36.830
Orlando Sequera: the intensity and the importance of the conflict.

3325
05:48:37.520 --> 05:48:39.300
Orlando Sequera: They also

3326
05:48:40.090 --> 05:48:43.810
Orlando Sequera: they also rely on the time given to resolve the conflict.

3327
05:48:44.140 --> 05:48:56.840
Orlando Sequera: the type of conflict that you're that you're dealing with ideally functional, not this functional Don't. Let it don't. Let it get to that point. If if it's going to be too late, so try to keep it on the level one.

3328
05:48:57.270 --> 05:49:02.090
Orlando Sequera: And these are the different tools that we have to address conflict

3329
05:49:02.600 --> 05:49:07.330
Orlando Sequera: we have. The first one is smoothing and accommodating

3330
05:49:07.700 --> 05:49:08.800
Orlando Sequera: this

3331
05:49:08.840 --> 05:49:09.980
Orlando Sequera: type of

3332
05:49:10.220 --> 05:49:12.310
Orlando Sequera: comfort, resolution, technique

3333
05:49:12.550 --> 05:49:16.649
Orlando Sequera: is when you try to emphasize areas of agreement.

3334
05:49:16.890 --> 05:49:24.529
Orlando Sequera: or when you're trying, and when you're trying to consider position to maintain harmony and relationship. But unfortunately.

3335
05:49:24.670 --> 05:49:30.260
Orlando Sequera: this type of conflict management approach is like a band. Date is short term

3336
05:49:30.700 --> 05:49:33.560
Orlando Sequera: you you're not because it doesn't address

3337
05:49:33.770 --> 05:49:34.720
Orlando Sequera: your

3338
05:49:35.050 --> 05:49:38.000
Orlando Sequera: the the root cost of the conflict.

3339
05:49:38.230 --> 05:49:40.960
Orlando Sequera: It is a temporary band date that we're putting

3340
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:44.659
Orlando Sequera: to address the comfort that is moving and accommodating

3341
05:49:44.870 --> 05:49:54.809
Orlando Sequera: examples of that. It happens a lot between countries that have different positions and disputes. They many cases they they try, they use moving and accommodating.

3342
05:49:54.990 --> 05:49:56.410
Orlando Sequera: But then,

3343
05:49:57.120 --> 05:50:01.549
Orlando Sequera: a few months later, a few years later, then the the conflicts and merch again.

3344
05:50:02.260 --> 05:50:12.080
Orlando Sequera: Another conflict management up conflict, management, resolution, technique, is avoidance or with role. You might be wondering how, how.

3345
05:50:12.130 --> 05:50:14.229
Orlando Sequera: with thrown or avoiding is

3346
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:21.659
Orlando Sequera: a way to soft comfort it Sometimes you need to regroup. You need to get more information

3347
05:50:21.710 --> 05:50:32.050
Orlando Sequera: about the conflict, and then, in order to come up with a better solution, so that it retreat from the situation plus foundation. Th: that's valid in some situations that

3348
05:50:32.080 --> 05:50:44.529
Orlando Sequera: that what? That's what needs to happen at least initially. And then we can use another another type of comfort, resolution, technique, compromise, or reconcile. This is

3349
05:50:45.440 --> 05:50:55.150
Orlando Sequera: a little bit better. This is this is where you incorporate multiple viewpoints and is about open dialogue to reach consensus and

3350
05:50:55.460 --> 05:51:00.319
Orlando Sequera: enable cooperative add it to store solving a problem.

3351
05:51:01.120 --> 05:51:17.300
Orlando Sequera: But this is also another mandate. Unfortunately, this is not long term not. It's not long term. It's another mandate that we're doing that we're putting the same as smoothing and accommodating. We're not addressing a root cost of the problem.

3352
05:51:18.060 --> 05:51:20.860
Orlando Sequera: Another way to solve conflict is

3353
05:51:20.930 --> 05:51:24.260
Orlando Sequera: by forcing or directing. This is

3354
05:51:24.340 --> 05:51:33.030
Orlando Sequera: imposing one viewpoint at the expense of others. This is what we what that what is also known as a win-loop situations.

3355
05:51:33.260 --> 05:51:35.500
Orlando Sequera: It is needed sometimes.

3356
05:51:35.700 --> 05:51:42.710
Orlando Sequera: It's one way to self-conflict it's an ideal. No, because one side is going to feel that they lost

3357
05:51:42.960 --> 05:51:44.800
Orlando Sequera: but the best

3358
05:51:44.830 --> 05:51:47.420
Orlando Sequera: and the preferred way

3359
05:51:47.480 --> 05:51:51.809
Orlando Sequera: to solve problems. The best way to solve

3360
05:51:52.240 --> 05:51:53.110
Orlando Sequera: conflict

3361
05:51:53.560 --> 05:51:57.670
Orlando Sequera: is through collaboration and problem solving.

3362
05:51:58.400 --> 05:52:01.240
Orlando Sequera: because here you are getting

3363
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:06.840
Orlando Sequera: several viewpoints and insights for multiple perspectives. But you're taking the time

3364
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:19.410
Orlando Sequera: to have an open dialogue. I really understand the multiple perspectives and addressing you are taking into account the root cost of the problems. And you're looking for solutions that

3365
05:52:19.420 --> 05:52:38.559
Orlando Sequera: lead to consensus and commitment. This is long term. This is the preferred way to solve conflict, collaboration and problem solving. Okay, this like here, important for the exam, make sure that you're familiar with this multiple ways, it. But

3366
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:39.480
Orlando Sequera: again.

3367
05:52:39.830 --> 05:52:41.610
Orlando Sequera: all of them are options.

3368
05:52:42.020 --> 05:52:56.480
Orlando Sequera: Pay attention to the scenario question to determine which one is the best option in that particular case. They're going to give you some hints that are associated with the best option. Again, my recommendation is, take practice questions. Okay.

3369
05:52:56.980 --> 05:52:58.150
Orlando Sequera: A

3370
05:53:00.380 --> 05:53:02.580
Orlando Sequera: another for broadcast.

3371
05:53:02.920 --> 05:53:07.290
Orlando Sequera: This. There is the 5 Y method technique which is

3372
05:53:07.830 --> 05:53:21.890
Orlando Sequera: a technique that was developed by a Japanese engineer at Toyota. And it's basically very simple. If you want to own, if you want to understand the root cause of a problem, you can ask the question

3373
05:53:21.960 --> 05:53:32.910
Orlando Sequera: Why? 5 times it's a rule of thumb. It might take more than 5, but it's around 5, and by asking the question 5 times, you're going to be able to uncover the root cost of a problem.

3374
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:49.170
Orlando Sequera: All right. So super important conflict management for your Pmp. Exam. Make sure that you are familiar with this content that you are sharp when it comes to emotional intelligence, and when you, when it comes to serving leadership.

3375
05:53:49.180 --> 05:53:55.230
Orlando Sequera: and also when it comes to conflict management, those 3 topics are going to be on your Pmp. Exam.

3376
05:53:58.160 --> 05:54:12.210
Orlando Sequera: All right. So what have we covered so far? Conflict management huge for the Pmp. Exam. Please take practice questions. Please review this content Review. The replays watch the additional videos that we have

3377
05:54:12.240 --> 05:54:16.440
Orlando Sequera: in Per Cpio. Make sure that you are sharp when it comes to

3378
05:54:16.690 --> 05:54:21.780
Orlando Sequera: a conflict management. It is huge for the exam. Okay.

3379
05:54:21.860 --> 05:54:28.599
Orlando Sequera: We also went over, define team ground rules and also building a sure understanding.

3380
05:54:30.330 --> 05:54:32.489
Orlando Sequera: And now so

3381
05:54:33.560 --> 05:54:41.949
Orlando Sequera: we have come to the end of the content, and we have still some time to go over questions. Please

3382
05:54:42.280 --> 05:54:43.300
Orlando Sequera: a

3383
05:54:44.690 --> 05:54:55.570
Orlando Sequera: feel free to ask questions. We're gonna take the rest of the time. And one thing that I would like to ask. Please fill out the survey. Thank you so much, for the feedback feedback is always useful. The goal is

3384
05:54:55.600 --> 05:55:05.069
Orlando Sequera: for us to provide you with the best experience, so please feel free to ask questions. I am going to review the Q. A. And i'm going to be answering

3385
05:55:05.180 --> 05:55:07.530
Orlando Sequera: the questions that you have

3386
05:55:10.020 --> 05:55:22.599
Orlando Sequera: again one more time. Please do not forget to fill out the survey. We are not. Yes, you can do the survey now. But please stay logged in. Okay, we're still. We. We still have a few minutes that we're going to use

3387
05:55:23.880 --> 05:55:31.390
Orlando Sequera: and feel free to ask questions, and I am going to be a answering the questions.

3388
05:55:34.400 --> 05:55:36.850
Orlando Sequera: Starting with the once I have the most folks.

3389
05:55:38.170 --> 05:55:40.760
Orlando Sequera: there's a question in the Q. A.

3390
05:55:40.930 --> 05:55:54.150
Orlando Sequera: Who did you talk to? If one of the stakeholders is not a line aligning and causing too much disruption to your project. After you have talked multiple times with respect to stakeholder, great question.

3391
05:55:54.200 --> 05:56:00.440
Orlando Sequera: my advice will be, Talk to your project. Sponsor. Your product. Sponsor is usually someone that has

3392
05:56:01.530 --> 05:56:11.539
Orlando Sequera: a high level of authority, and they are vested in your project, talk to your sponsor, explain the situation, explain importantly, more properly, the efforts

3393
05:56:11.660 --> 05:56:24.919
Orlando Sequera: that you have that you have tried right. Don't. Don't go a make sure that they know that you're You're going to them because it's the last resort. So leverage your sponsor. If you're going through that situation

3394
05:56:25.790 --> 05:56:26.980
Orlando Sequera: that happens a lot

3395
05:56:34.480 --> 05:56:40.649
Orlando Sequera: slide 139. There was a test prep question. And what is the best way to measure training outcomes

3396
05:56:47.480 --> 05:56:57.660
Orlando Sequera: the answers included post-training performance assessments for strain surveys and measuring increased team velocity. The right answer was measuring and increasing velocity. I would

3397
05:56:58.080 --> 05:57:05.829
Orlando Sequera: I would love to expand, but I need the context of the question there, and they are not trying to be

3398
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:10.960
Orlando Sequera: I'm not trying to be mean, or anything, or or dismissed the question. But

3399
05:57:11.070 --> 05:57:23.259
Orlando Sequera: there is. You can have a long question, but it's gonna be one word. And this is my advice for the Pmp. Exam. Read the questions carefully, because there's one word that can change the entire.

3400
05:57:23.440 --> 05:57:29.520
Orlando Sequera: the entire the entire question. So you might be thinking initially that they're asking you something.

3401
05:57:29.670 --> 05:57:30.520
Orlando Sequera: But

3402
05:57:30.850 --> 05:57:44.780
Orlando Sequera: there is a word at the end a key word that can change the entire question, and you might be getting the run assumption. So read the questions carefully. You need to have the the context of the question. Pmi is notorious for that.

3403
05:57:46.180 --> 05:57:47.380
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3404
05:57:48.670 --> 05:57:50.020
Orlando Sequera: what else?

3405
05:57:53.250 --> 05:58:07.449
Orlando Sequera: Another question. Why do we not have a conflict management plan like. We have plans for other important areas of the project. Well, it's not a specific area of your project, but you have comfortable resolution techniques and

3406
05:58:08.190 --> 05:58:09.380
Orlando Sequera: You have

3407
05:58:09.460 --> 05:58:21.149
Orlando Sequera: the tools to address it, because it's not necessary in the area. It's not an area of your project. It's something that is going to happen because you're working with other people. That's why it's not necessarily an area of your project.

3408
05:58:21.640 --> 05:58:23.500
Orlando Sequera: That's why we don't have a plan for that.

3409
05:58:31.520 --> 05:58:51.169
Orlando Sequera: there's another coming in. The chat. Orlando, obviously agile and waterful approaches have press and cons absolutely. The P. And I have spoken with advice, choosing either agile or whatever, and steering clear of hybrid, because they believe hybrid, and elicits the negative aspects of both. No, I disagree with that statement.

3410
05:58:51.230 --> 05:58:55.460
Orlando Sequera: I think actually that most organizations use some type of hybrid.

3411
05:58:55.550 --> 05:58:56.740
Orlando Sequera: And

3412
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:10.410
Orlando Sequera: no, I I I disagree with that statement. Honestly. I don't think that hybrid brings the negative aspects of both. Actually, the opposite in my experience is the opposite

3413
05:59:10.570 --> 05:59:12.429
Orlando Sequera: A. But

3414
05:59:12.810 --> 05:59:29.510
Orlando Sequera: in deciding which approach is best, pay attention to the scope. Scope is king, as I mentioned. Are you working with scope that is really complex. Or is the team very familiar with the scope like building a one-story house in a construction company. So that'll be my my recommendation.

3415
05:59:34.770 --> 05:59:35.400
Orlando Sequera: Hmm.

3416
05:59:36.930 --> 05:59:39.580
Orlando Sequera: Can I review the 3 areas again?

3417
05:59:39.750 --> 05:59:44.719
Orlando Sequera: You gotta be more specific. I don't know what 3 areas we have.

3418
05:59:45.380 --> 05:59:47.640
Orlando Sequera: We have been carrying multiple areas.

3419
05:59:50.630 --> 06:00:03.369
Orlando Sequera: Can you elaborate more than negotiations that collaboration activity world You're going to be engaging with other people for communication is negotiation about the work that it's been done about contracts and agreements with suppliers, so negotiation is going to be

3420
06:00:04.930 --> 06:00:08.690
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be a constant in your project.

3421
06:00:12.430 --> 06:00:22.469
Orlando Sequera: When does Hr. Get involved in conflict management. When When the conflict becomes dysfunctional, anything above the level level, 2 in the scale, the least scale.

3422
06:00:23.140 --> 06:00:31.419
Orlando Sequera: It's a you need to get Hr. Involved when it becomes this functional conflict, then by that I mean when it's taken to a personal level.

3423
06:00:47.770 --> 06:00:50.609
Orlando Sequera: it seem applicable to adaptive. Yes.

3424
06:00:55.610 --> 06:00:56.220
Orlando Sequera: Oh.

3425
06:00:57.250 --> 06:01:02.450
Orlando Sequera: There is a lot of coverage on the people. Domain or aspect are this restricted?

3426
06:01:02.840 --> 06:01:05.030
Orlando Sequera: Are this restricted? If

3427
06:01:06.270 --> 06:01:07.450
Orlando Sequera: i'm sorry

3428
06:01:10.270 --> 06:01:21.050
Orlando Sequera: there's a lot of coverage on the people aspect are this restricted If the organization is functional week matrix. No. This applicable to any type of organization you're working with people.

3429
06:01:21.490 --> 06:01:24.089
Orlando Sequera: The organizations have formed by people.

3430
06:01:24.120 --> 06:01:24.790
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3431
06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:36.529
Orlando Sequera: how can us P. And Foster bear collaboration will first you to figure out what type of organization you're working with. But it's applicable to any organization.

3432
06:01:37.260 --> 06:01:48.549
Orlando Sequera: If it's a functional with matrix, you have to use leadership. You have no authority or very low authority. Then team building activities through leadership serve a leadership.

3433
06:01:48.940 --> 06:01:50.419
Orlando Sequera: That will be the answer

3434
06:01:54.480 --> 06:01:59.249
Orlando Sequera: regarding the weather in the desert representing on planned risk.

3435
06:01:59.630 --> 06:02:06.990
Orlando Sequera: we're in the Pmp process, if anywhere. That's a referred to basic steps in a more bullet point form

3436
06:02:08.010 --> 06:02:16.770
Orlando Sequera: It's that's not how it works. We have. We have the tools and techniques, but we have to learn how to use them. They're not going to give you a clear. Oh, go here! No.

3437
06:02:16.990 --> 06:02:28.940
Orlando Sequera: no, we we have to learn that covering the content when in that situation, would you escalate the unplanned risk as an issue that has affected the critical path? Well, first of all, if feed of

3438
06:02:29.150 --> 06:02:36.779
Orlando Sequera: only if it's, if it affects the critical path, may or may not affect. The risk may or may not affect the critical path, but you have to

3439
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:48.179
Orlando Sequera: You you have to address. You have to escalate right away, because to address this risk you have to check the risk management plan

3440
06:02:48.250 --> 06:03:00.729
Orlando Sequera: for starters. That step number one, and you have to use management reserves because you didn't account for this risk. You didn't plan for this, major grain in the middle of the desert. Right.

3441
06:03:00.780 --> 06:03:02.329
Orlando Sequera: So you have to

3442
06:03:02.570 --> 06:03:08.560
Orlando Sequera: a escalate the issue. Ask for permission to use management reserves, and that's how you address it.

3443
06:03:14.440 --> 06:03:33.979
Orlando Sequera: from a Pmp. Mindset. What is the ideal meaning length that it depends on the topic. It depends on the project. It depends on what you're trying to do. There's not a set formula for meeting duration. No, it can be an hour. It can be 2 h. It really depends. But my recommendation is as if your team members are asking you

3444
06:03:34.140 --> 06:03:48.700
Orlando Sequera: to get clarification. For example, they're trying to understand a little bit more of a requirement. Ask, ask them, is this something complex? Can we do it in half an hour. Can we do it in an hour? Ask them so I ha ask questions right? But it changes this sort of saved

3445
06:03:48.750 --> 06:03:50.419
Orlando Sequera: a formula for that?

3446
06:03:56.300 --> 06:04:01.530
Orlando Sequera: What is the best training approach for long-term organization benefits

3447
06:04:01.890 --> 06:04:12.859
Orlando Sequera: a all of them. Work, I mean, do you have to figure out which one works best depend. It depends on the budget. It depends on the type of industry. It depends on the

3448
06:04:13.180 --> 06:04:20.860
Orlando Sequera: multiple factors. I mean it's kind of hard to to say with, it depends on your specific situation.

3449
06:04:22.570 --> 06:04:24.340
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

3450
06:04:27.450 --> 06:04:35.929
Orlando Sequera: Can skill frame opportunities be through? That's incentive for team members to strive for? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, you. That's a nice positive spin.

3451
06:04:40.770 --> 06:04:41.850
Orlando Sequera: a

3452
06:04:42.100 --> 06:04:42.660
there.

3453
06:04:45.050 --> 06:04:48.389
Orlando Sequera: What about conflict due to authority of a team member?

3454
06:04:49.560 --> 06:05:00.199
Orlando Sequera: Well, the answer is the racy matrix, right? So in in. We are as a as a team. We are the same. Ideally, we are the same level. So

3455
06:05:00.310 --> 06:05:01.500
Orlando Sequera: that is

3456
06:05:07.170 --> 06:05:10.139
Orlando Sequera: something that we have to to keep in mind.

3457
06:05:13.020 --> 06:05:16.819
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between compromise and

3458
06:05:18.370 --> 06:05:20.149
Orlando Sequera: i'm sorry. Let me go back.

3459
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:31.669
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between compromise and collaboration? Compromise is short-term collaboration is long-term, and it

3460
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:34.280
Orlando Sequera: takes into account the root cause of the problem.

3461
06:05:40.050 --> 06:05:44.250
Orlando Sequera: Is there a default role, a person who can become the product sponsor? It's usually someone

3462
06:05:45.170 --> 06:05:55.080
Orlando Sequera: a in up management that is going to be vested in the project is is vested in the same set. They want to make sure that this project is successful.

3463
06:05:55.570 --> 06:06:12.880
Orlando Sequera: You don't need to look for a sponsor. It's gonna be assigned when the project is in the genesis process. It's not up to you to find the sponsor. No, someone's going to be in the organization a project champion or a project sponsor that's going to happen in in the in the organization so.

3464
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:15.870
Orlando Sequera: but it's not up to you as a Pm. To look for a sponsor.

3465
06:06:19.200 --> 06:06:20.740
Orlando Sequera: A.

3466
06:06:22.080 --> 06:06:29.530
Orlando Sequera: Would you be able to do a wrap up on top tips. I'm trying to do that. But yeah, hopefully, we have time. That's my goal to have a wrap up.

3467
06:06:29.630 --> 06:06:31.230
Orlando Sequera: Yes, I

3468
06:06:32.100 --> 06:06:35.429
Orlando Sequera: I will do a wrap up and final tips for

3469
06:06:38.140 --> 06:06:40.629
Orlando Sequera: for the exam as much as possible.

3470
06:06:44.340 --> 06:06:50.989
Orlando Sequera: Oh, 3 areas Emotional intelligence. That's one of them. Serve a leadership conflict, resolution.

3471
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:52.190
Orlando Sequera: a

3472
06:06:52.380 --> 06:06:53.680
Orlando Sequera: key aspects

3473
06:06:53.700 --> 06:06:54.970
Orlando Sequera: for the exam.

3474
06:07:02.210 --> 06:07:04.930
Orlando Sequera: How do we handle politics among team members? Well.

3475
06:07:05.400 --> 06:07:15.640
Orlando Sequera: understanding that some enterprise, environmental factor, address that team, building, build, trust by building trust and team building activities. Build Trust with your team members.

3476
06:07:27.230 --> 06:07:33.470
Orlando Sequera: Another question is it wise to determine if a resource will be a good fit for the team personality wise

3477
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:39.309
Orlando Sequera: in the interview. Yes, for agile teams

3478
06:07:40.140 --> 06:07:49.680
Orlando Sequera: they want to be involved in that process. Agile teams they like to be involved in that process. They're self-organized and self-managed, and they can.

3479
06:07:50.300 --> 06:07:58.230
Orlando Sequera: They're usually part of the interviewing process when the when we're bringing a new team member so it's

3480
06:07:58.490 --> 06:08:02.109
Orlando Sequera: it. It. Yeah, it is the short answer to that question is, Yes.

3481
06:08:10.020 --> 06:08:11.510
Orlando Sequera: through racy

3482
06:08:11.620 --> 06:08:15.189
Orlando Sequera: verify work, scope, or in of individual, whoever it.

3483
06:08:15.270 --> 06:08:26.440
Orlando Sequera: What a Pm. Can do If any employee refused to view config or clear the visual responsibility. As well refer to the team charter and the ground rules and the racing.

3484
06:08:27.240 --> 06:08:29.110
Orlando Sequera: That's why you created that.

3485
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:39.240
Orlando Sequera: to begin with, to you, you need to use it to address that situation. If they don't want to follow that, then they are gonna be, is their

3486
06:08:40.560 --> 06:08:42.879
Orlando Sequera: it's their problem.

3487
06:08:42.940 --> 06:08:43.560
Orlando Sequera: Thanks.

3488
06:08:47.970 --> 06:08:49.870

Orlando Sequera: innovation connected? Well.

3491
06:09:00.580 --> 06:09:07.989
Orlando Sequera: changes, right changes can be disruptive. But if you are working in a psychologically safe environment

3492
06:09:08.040 --> 06:09:12.169
Orlando Sequera: team members are going to feel confident enough to share.

3493
06:09:12.250 --> 06:09:18.209
Orlando Sequera: and their ideas, and sometimes they can be disruptive. They're changing, proposing to change

3494
06:09:18.330 --> 06:09:21.850
Orlando Sequera: the way we are handling

3495
06:09:21.890 --> 06:09:23.760
Orlando Sequera: something. So

3496
06:09:23.940 --> 06:09:26.460
Orlando Sequera: that's what we that's how change

3497

3501
06:09:52.480 --> 06:09:56.730
Orlando Sequera: 10, if not at all likely, then

3502
06:09:56.760 --> 06:09:58.210

Orlando Sequera: Q. And a.

3508
06:10:27.790 --> 06:10:29.970
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

3509
06:10:30.130 --> 06:10:32.979
Orlando Sequera: What percentage of questions are mathematic and permanent?

3510
06:10:33.040 --> 06:10:38.249
Orlando Sequera: You not many questions formula related, if any at all. Not many questions.

3511
06:10:38.860 --> 06:10:41.739
Orlando Sequera: That's the Pm. Need to have map

3512
06:10:41.840 --> 06:10:47.229
Orlando Sequera: all the roles and tasks before making a race that you do that with a team. Yes, you do that with the team.

3513
06:10:47.380 --> 06:10:52.100
Orlando Sequera: So who's gonna be responsible for what? When you have the list of activities?

3514
06:10:57.070 --> 06:10:59.240
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3515
06:10:59.480 --> 06:11:05.910
Orlando Sequera: how do you handle political interference. Where do you have to elaborate that? A little bit more? Understand it? But make sure that you reinforce

3516
06:11:06.060 --> 06:11:09.830
Orlando Sequera: the team commitment and make sure that you build Trust

3517
06:11:10.030 --> 06:11:11.430
Orlando Sequera: with your team members.

3518
06:11:14.240 --> 06:11:14.990
Orlando Sequera: Hmm.

3519
06:11:18.300 --> 06:11:19.790
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3520
06:11:24.310 --> 06:11:39.059
Orlando Sequera: What resource would you recommend more than others for the test? Prep aside the test? Prep. Learn practice Exam. Ping. I would recommend this content. This content that we're covering is, should be your go to source for

3521
06:11:39.080 --> 06:11:41.110
Orlando Sequera: your preparation efforts.

3522
06:11:43.020 --> 06:11:45.019
Orlando Sequera: These slides that we are covering

3523
06:11:49.970 --> 06:12:04.930
Orlando Sequera: how to deal with this situation. When you take over the the running project, and there is a conflict in the team, you do not know each other, but you need to tackle the situation quickly and gain for us. Rebuild the team to be able to move on.

3524
06:12:05.160 --> 06:12:08.079
Orlando Sequera: not necessary to rebuild I

3525
06:12:10.230 --> 06:12:11.610
Orlando Sequera: my apologies

3526
06:12:12.240 --> 06:12:18.329
Orlando Sequera: in that situation. I will talk to each team member individually, and try to understand

3527
06:12:18.430 --> 06:12:23.650
Orlando Sequera: a where, what is their position? That's what I will do in that situation?

3528
06:12:29.850 --> 06:12:37.829
Orlando Sequera: Is it the case that only stakeholders can request changes that is going to be defined in your scope Management plan? Who can request a change.

3529
06:12:38.160 --> 06:12:43.560
Orlando Sequera: And it could be a team member. It could be only stakeholders. But that's gonna be defined there.

3530
06:12:43.730 --> 06:12:48.390
Orlando Sequera: So whatever that's why we define the rules right? That's why we create the plans.

3531
06:12:48.570 --> 06:12:51.649
Orlando Sequera: So review the scope management plan.

3532
06:12:52.800 --> 06:12:58.380
Orlando Sequera: In some cases both can propose changes. Do you have to define who can create a change request.

3533
06:13:10.420 --> 06:13:11.530
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3534
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:17.890
Orlando Sequera: in the project status report to stakeholders we mentioned Project risk

3535
06:13:18.190 --> 06:13:23.359
Orlando Sequera: is that considered an escalation? No, that's considered as informing them of risk status.

3536
06:13:23.380 --> 06:13:28.970
Orlando Sequera: That's not escalation. You are informing them of your efforts. You're not escalating

3537
06:13:29.160 --> 06:13:31.160
Orlando Sequera: to them. You gotta keep them in form.

3538
06:13:32.560 --> 06:13:35.250
Orlando Sequera: If senior members are using

3539
06:13:39.190 --> 06:13:46.380
Orlando Sequera: their influence to negatively shape the project where the option of the Pm. Work. Again, work with your sponsor, work with your sponsor

3540
06:13:53.500 --> 06:13:58.580
Orlando Sequera: that's in the P. The product owner communicate up? No, they communicate down to with a team.

3541
06:13:59.680 --> 06:14:03.529
Orlando Sequera: That's it's actually deliation both ways upward and down work.

3542
06:14:08.640 --> 06:14:21.730
Orlando Sequera: How did you validate team member training or knowledge, sharing what successful? Well did they get the certifications that they needed? You can perform a post-test analysis on the competencies. They they learn about

3543
06:14:22.260 --> 06:14:26.360
Orlando Sequera: the new skill set. There are ways that you can that you can do that

3544
06:14:27.110 --> 06:14:28.969
Orlando Sequera: multiple ways that you can do that.

3545
06:14:32.280 --> 06:14:34.800
Orlando Sequera: What would you do with the tech like that, don't.

3546
06:14:34.830 --> 06:14:39.320
Orlando Sequera: if you feel, what would you do if the tech lead

3547
06:14:40.940 --> 06:14:47.370
Orlando Sequera: doesn't seem to listen and they don't. Listen! We'll talk to them, talk to them, talk to them, communicate, communicate.

3548
06:14:47.500 --> 06:14:50.479
Orlando Sequera: and make sure that they understand the urgency

3549
06:14:51.140 --> 06:14:56.229
Orlando Sequera: that they for them to listen, work with them, communicate, communicate, communicate.

3550
06:15:04.930 --> 06:15:15.890
Orlando Sequera: active listening. Is this the techniques of a technique about yourself or team members of stakeholders? It starts with you. But ideally you are modeling that behavior with your

3551
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:19.570
Orlando Sequera: a team, members and your stakeholders

3552
06:15:24.930 --> 06:15:33.089
Orlando Sequera: is something more common in person, or visual, or visual or virtual teams, and your experience in both the happens in both regardless of

3553
06:15:33.290 --> 06:15:34.280
Orlando Sequera: a

3554
06:15:34.640 --> 06:15:35.860
Orlando Sequera: It can happen

3555
06:15:36.250 --> 06:15:37.400
Orlando Sequera: both ways.

3556
06:15:42.830 --> 06:15:44.609
Orlando Sequera: When do we have

3557
06:15:44.810 --> 06:15:47.820
Orlando Sequera: to involve Hr. In the conflict?

3558
06:15:48.110 --> 06:15:57.229
Orlando Sequera: Resolution, step when the conflict is this functional, and we cannot solve it through using this comfort. Resolution techniques that we cover today

3559
06:15:57.530 --> 06:16:03.850
Orlando Sequera: when it involves the separate sanctions. Usually when it's this functional comfort, conflict, situation is taken to

3560
06:16:04.240 --> 06:16:05.070
Orlando Sequera: they

3561
06:16:05.390 --> 06:16:06.909
Orlando Sequera: A is taken

3562
06:16:06.930 --> 06:16:08.500
Orlando Sequera: to a personal level.

3563
06:16:18.350 --> 06:16:22.200
Orlando Sequera: It's the first to say the formulas are not needed to memorize for the exam.

3564
06:16:22.760 --> 06:16:24.790
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily.

3565
06:16:25.010 --> 06:16:37.150
Orlando Sequera: but what's really gone, what is important? And when we covered in value management tomorrow, it's going to make a little bit more sense. It's more about the interpretation than the former. It doesn't hurt.

3566
06:16:37.170 --> 06:16:41.349
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to say My opinion is it doesn't hurt, but it's not a must.

3567
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:44.120
Orlando Sequera: But you need to know the interpretation of

3568
06:16:44.270 --> 06:16:46.840
Orlando Sequera: the metrics of those

3569
06:16:46.930 --> 06:16:50.300
Orlando Sequera: a different metrics that we're going to be using. Okay.

3570
06:16:57.940 --> 06:16:59.520
Orlando Sequera: Er.

3571
06:17:02.240 --> 06:17:10.470
Orlando Sequera: this is different from the answer. No test Prep: Well, again, we need to. We will have to review the question specifically. It's hard without the question.

3572
06:17:11.590 --> 06:17:13.339
Orlando Sequera: The questions are very specific.

3573
06:17:14.710 --> 06:17:17.490
Orlando Sequera: Do business analysts work frequently in projects? Yes.

3574
06:17:22.480 --> 06:17:26.280
Orlando Sequera: when do we use risk mitigation when we have when we're trying to

3575
06:17:26.340 --> 06:17:29.640
Orlando Sequera: respond to high probability, high impact risks?

3576
06:17:33.150 --> 06:17:37.800
Orlando Sequera: Would you recommend Taylor in personal study guides to the questions in practice exams.

3577
06:17:37.940 --> 06:17:42.289
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily, not necessarily. I will.

3578
06:17:42.380 --> 06:17:43.910
Orlando Sequera: I would recommend

3579
06:17:44.120 --> 06:17:46.250
Orlando Sequera: to take practice questions, but

3580
06:17:46.850 --> 06:17:48.110
Orlando Sequera: a

3581
06:17:48.560 --> 06:17:58.849
Orlando Sequera: take as many as possible to get used to the type of to the type of questions, but they're not going to be exactly the same in the Pmp. Exam. They styled it's going to be similar, but it's not going to be exactly the same question.

3582
06:17:58.890 --> 06:18:01.790
Orlando Sequera: Perform sort analysis

3583
06:18:01.940 --> 06:18:03.210
Orlando Sequera: to understand your

3584
06:18:03.500 --> 06:18:06.570
Orlando Sequera: strings and weaknesses, and your opportunities and threats.

3585
06:18:06.650 --> 06:18:14.450
Orlando Sequera: so you can work on developing those witnesses. And with that we have come to the end of today's session.

3586
06:18:14.510 --> 06:18:16.519
Orlando Sequera: Thank you very much. Everyone.

3587
06:18:17.300 --> 06:18:19.090
Orlando Sequera: We'll do it again tomorrow.

06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:20.570
Orlando Sequera: and we have.

3589
