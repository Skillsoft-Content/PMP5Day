Orlando Sequera: Questions about replace for study purposes. You attended all 5 sessions, and you will like to have access to recordings for review purposes.

135
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:17.419
Orlando Sequera: no restrictions. When it comes to that. Do you have no limitations in asking for all the replace

136
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.700
Orlando Sequera: for study purposes. They will be available to you for study purposes.

137
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:28.899
Orlando Sequera: All right. And now, since we're coming to the end of

138
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.420
Orlando Sequera: your

139
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.790
Orlando Sequera: a.

140
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.660
Orlando Sequera: we're coming to the end of the class we are. You're gonna get a certificate of completion

141
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.609
Orlando Sequera: at the end of your class.

142
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.830
Orlando Sequera: And for that

143
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.999
Orlando Sequera: we are going to watch.

144
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.720
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna watch a video that is gonna help us to understand a little bit more about

145
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.350
Orlando Sequera: our certificates of completion.

146
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.330
And

147
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.480
Orlando Sequera: here we go

148
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.970
in this video we will discuss Pmp. Certificates of completion.

149
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:44.999
If you haven't already done so, please watch the Pmp. 5 day and 8 day attendance video for important information about your attendance, and how to manually track your attendance. Using the attendance tracker document.

150
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:51.719
This document is required. If you must request your certificate using the certificate request center.

151
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.610
Next, we will talk about the certificate of completion.

152
00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:07.440
Please note that the Pmi application does not require that you attach a certificate of completion to your application. However they may ask for it. If your application is selected for an audit.

153
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:13.969
even if Pmi doesn't require it, you might want to keep this certificate of completion for your own records.

154
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:26.280
Let's go over the methods and steps you will need to follow in order to receive your certificate to receive your Pdu certificate. You must first meet the attendance requirements by completing the boot camp.

155
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:38.739
This means you must attend all the boot, camp sessions live or attend the minimum number of boot camp sessions live, and making up the remaining sessions by watching on replay for the type of boot camp you are attending

156
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:44.099
for details. Please watch the Pmp. 5 day and 8 day attendance. Video.

157
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.380
Second, you must use one of the available methods to receive your certificate

158
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:56.829
method one is a self-serve option only available for percipio users that attend all the sessions live.

159
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:04.180
If you are a percipio user and must join one or more sessions through zoom, you may have to use method. 2.

160
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:14.260
Please Note: if you are a percipio user check to see if you can get your certificate with the self-serve option before resorting to the certificate request center method

161
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:20.609
for all other users. You will need to request your certificate through the certificate request center.

162
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.190
Next we will cover the steps for both methods.

163
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:33.889
Let's go over the steps you will need to follow for method one in order to request your certificate. The steps are labeled in the Graphic for you to follow along

164
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.150
for step. One click on your name in the upper right hand corner

165
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.549
for step, 2 click activity from the menu that appears from step one

166
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:52.040
for step, 3, expand activity on the left-hand side to reveal the Pmi pdu option and select it

167
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.830
for Step 4, click the 3 vertical dots to the right of the highest score column

168
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.929
for Step 5 click the view certificate option.

169
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:10.489
Once your certificate opens in your browser. Save it to your computer, using the save option in the window. The certificate opens in.

170
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:16.770
Let's go over the steps you will need to follow for method 2 in order to request your certificate.

171
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:25.170
This applies to non-persivial users, and those percipio users that are not able to get their certificate through the self-serve option

172
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.810
We recommend using chrome to request your certificate.

173
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:37.460
Please visit certificate, request dotcom and click the request button to go to the instructions page.

174
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:44.530
Next review the attention learner's screen and then click, proceed to request certificate

175
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:51.810
in step. One search for the course by the course Id llpm 0 0 1 5,

176
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.419
just to confirm Those are zeros, not the letter o

177
00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.940
the course. Title is Pmp. Exam. Prep. Pmi. Atp Boot Camp.

178
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.079
Select the course by clicking the checkbox under Pmi Pdu, and click next

179
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:18.669
in step 2, you should be able to select the date for the last session you attended, or replay session you watched whichever is the later date in the calendar selector. If you are using chrome.

180
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.129
enter 100 for the score.

181
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.770
Here are some important points to keep in mind for this step.

182
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.430
You cannot enter a future date. The class must have already ended.

183
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:38.830
If you get a date error, it may be because the completion date field does not have the calendar selector, and you manually entered the date in the wrong format.

184
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.590
If your browser doesn't have the calendar selector, try the following for the completion: date

185
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.009
for the months: January to September. Use a single number one through 9

186
00:17:50.100 --> 00:18:02.330
for the days of the month. Use a single number one to 9. Click next. If you get an error one at a time. Try preceding the single number with a 0 until the error is resolved.

187
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.669
Do not use the percentage symbol for the score.

188
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.260
The score field must be the number 100 only.

189
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:15.680
In step 3. You'll need to upload your attendance tracker document in its native word format.

190
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.829
You can only upload one document, and your attendance tracker is the one document you must upload.

191
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.430
Once you have uploaded your attendance tracker document, click next

192
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:43.449
in step 4 you will enter your user profile information. Please include the name you want used on your certificate. It should be the same name used during your boot camp sessions not to worry, though if there was an issue with your name based on how you joined the session.

193
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.399
you should have manually captured it in the attendance tracker document.

194
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.629
enter the email address where you want to receive your certificate.

195
00:18:51.730 --> 00:19:02.029
If during the boot camp session you used different email addresses for the different join methods. One of the email addresses used must be used here for your user profile

196
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:20.909
Note: When we say join method. It may have been through your training site or directly through zoom, which could potentially have different email addresses associated with them. Depending on your setup. The organization is the name of the company or institution that is providing you with access to your boot camp training.

197
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.400
Once you have entered your information, click next

198
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:34.790
in step 5 review the certificate request summary information. If you entered something incorrectly, select the previous button to go to the appropriate step.

199
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.220
If everything looks good, click the submit button

200
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:57.829
note after you have submitted your certificate request, you will see a generic response to the effect of. We have received. The uploaded progress Reports, with your submission, and your certificates will be processed within the next 14 business days. We will contact you if we have questions regarding the report you provided

201
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:12.480
Orlando Sequera: please keep in mind the number of business days in the generic response may change, your attendance will be verified. Using the uploaded file and the zoom attendance report that is saved by Skillsoft after each live or replace session.

202
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:20.319
Once your attendance has been confirmed, a 35 h Pdu certificate of completion will be issued to you by email.

203
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:34.219
Orlando Sequera: If it's been longer than the number of business days provided in the generic response. And you, Haven't received your certificate. Please check your spam or junk folder of the email address you used for your user profile in Step 4.

204
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:40.109
It may be the case. The email with your certificate was delivered there instead of your inbox.

205
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:52.170
If you need to inquire about the status of your certificate request after the number of business days has expired, please email certificate.requests@skillsoft.com.

206
00:20:52.430 --> 00:21:04.999
If you have any certificate related questions based on what was discussed here, please contact the Skillsoft mentoring team by email the email address is mentoring@skillsoft.com

207
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.150
Orlando Sequera: all right. So

208
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.959
Orlando Sequera: this will be one of the videos. They

209
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.480
Orlando Sequera: that we're going to be playing during the 1 h lunch break.

210
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.420
Orlando Sequera: So you'll have. This is recorded. This is available.

211
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:25.040
Orlando Sequera: and you'll have the chance to review this information in more in more detail. So 2 ways to get

212
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.210
Orlando Sequera: your certificate of completion

213
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.180
Orlando Sequera: for your Pmp. Exempt.

214
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.090
All right.

215
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.510
Orlando Sequera: And now we are going to

216
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.750
Orlando Sequera: do a recap. We cover

217
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.410
Orlando Sequera: a very important content. Yesterday

218
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.389
Orlando Sequera: we started with

219
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.309
Orlando Sequera: the risk super important area for the exam.

220
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.180
Orlando Sequera: We learned the definition of risk. We cover

221
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.870
Orlando Sequera: the fact that we have 2 types of risks. We have positive risks

222
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.649
Orlando Sequera: that are called opportunities. We have

223
00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:08.430
Orlando Sequera: negative risks that we call threats, and we know that at risk it's it's an uncertainty that may or may not happen in our project.

224
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.590
Orlando Sequera: and we also learned that when it comes to risk, there are

225
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:32.020
Orlando Sequera: basically 3 main steps that we have to follow. We have to start by identifying the possible risks that are that, could I that could impact our project. And we're not we're going to look at them from 2 perspectives we're going to look at them at them from the likelihood or probability of a current, and also

226
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:36.729
Orlando Sequera: the impact to our project. So the first step is risk identification.

227
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:47.079
Orlando Sequera: We have to involve everyone in risk identification. Remember that for the exam. We have to. It's not just you the Pm: yeah, of course you're part of

228
00:22:47.160 --> 00:23:06.929
Orlando Sequera: you. You are one of the main parties. When it comes to risk notification. You have to do your best, but you also have to rely on the team. Remember that they're the the ones that are most familiar with the scope that is being a that is part of your project. The work that is being done to produce those project deliverables.

229
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:15.200
Orlando Sequera: They need to help your stakeholders have to help. And basically anyone within the organization that can assist.

230
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:22.839
Orlando Sequera: Please make sure that you provide that awareness. Risk identification is a team sport. It's not to. It's not an individual sport.

231
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.060
Orlando Sequera: all right.

232
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.410
Orlando Sequera: and the outcome of that process is going to be

233
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:39.989
Orlando Sequera: What an artifact that we call risk register. It's nothing but a spreadsheet, a list of risks that we have been able to identify. Okay, so that's version one

234
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.680
Orlando Sequera: of our risk register. We just have a list of risks that we have been able to identify the second step when it comes to risk

235
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:57.450
Orlando Sequera: is risk, assessment and work or risk analysis. We're gonna do that from 2 perspectives. The first one is, and that's the most common one

236
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.200
Orlando Sequera: most organizations

237
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:08.209
Orlando Sequera: use. This approach is what we call qualitative risk analysis. This is a type of analysis that is turning a subjective manner.

238
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.409
Orlando Sequera: and it's based on expertise

239
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.340
Orlando Sequera: mainly your team members

240
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.430
Orlando Sequera: and some text stakeholder stakeholders. For that matter.

241
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.230
Orlando Sequera: they have been in similar situations in the past. They have experience

242
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:35.410
Orlando Sequera: xyc risks. They know which ones have a higher probability of impact, a and and higher impact, high prevalent of occurrence and a higher impact to the project. And they can start and using some

243
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:46.819
Orlando Sequera: a template that may or may not be available in the organization, like the probability and impact matrix. Your what you're trying to do with this qualitative analysis is to

244
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.800
Orlando Sequera: it prioritized your risks, and you might be wondering well why

245
00:24:52.060 --> 00:25:09.029
Orlando Sequera: Don't? Why can we address every single risk? And the answer to that is, remember for your project. You have limited resources. You only have a set amount of time and a set amount of money to complete your and and limited resources. By that I mean people, and

246
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.269
Orlando Sequera: and also materials, equipment, and and and supply.

247
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:21.269
Orlando Sequera: in order to complete your project. So that means that you have to prioritize. That's what we're doing with this type of analysis.

248
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.190
Orlando Sequera: So

249
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:34.740
Orlando Sequera: the outcome of that analysis is going to be version 2 of your race register. Now, with that information that we completed, we are going to rearrange our

250
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:42.260
Orlando Sequera: risk, register how those risks that have a higher probability of occurrence or likelihood is the same.

251
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:52.700
Orlando Sequera: and impact are going to go to the top of the risk register. Those that have a lower probability of occurrence and impact are going to go to the bottom of the risk register.

252
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.400
Orlando Sequera: and then

253
00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:01.520
Orlando Sequera: we move on and perform the second type of assessment or analysis, which is what we call.

254
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:17.770
Orlando Sequera: while it qualitative, quantitative, quantitative risk analysis. And here the differences that we're going to be using data. This is where those simulations come into play. The classic example, as I mentioned yesterday, for

255
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.299
Orlando Sequera: quantitative risk analysis is

256
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.760
Orlando Sequera: the Monte Carlo simulation.

257
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.710
Orlando Sequera: Here we're going to be using specialized equipment

258
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:47.340
Orlando Sequera: because depending on the complexity that of over projects. Some products are very complex. That's dictated by the scope. And we need to do a thorough job in analyzing the possible scenarios. And for that we're gonna use. We're gonna need simulation. We we're gonna need

259
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:58.099
Orlando Sequera: specialized equipment computers that can run simulations and then analyze thousands of possible scenarios. So so we can come

260
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:16.379
Orlando Sequera: with a range of scenarios, and that's what we do with the actual quantitative type of risk analysis it's supported by data. This is not used in every single industry is used in some industries. This equipment is very expensive. Most organizations do not have

261
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:27.460
Orlando Sequera: a this type of equipment in place, but some examples are weather forecasting. They do have that in place, and they use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict the path of

262
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:34.390
Orlando Sequera: storms and hurricanes. For example, we do have a we do have it in. Airspace

263
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:42.510
Orlando Sequera: is widely used to represent, for example, the conditions of outer space that could impact or affect a a spacecraft. So

264
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:59.139
Orlando Sequera: that is that we need a complex simulation for that. So some industry, healthcare, they use it in as well financial industry as well insurance. They use it as well, so some industries they use it. A some industries don't.

265
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:05.899
Orlando Sequera: But for the exam for the purposes of the exam you need to assume that you're going to be

266
00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:19.240
Orlando Sequera: assessing risks, following the qualitative risk analysis and the quantitative risk analysis. Okay, and the outcome of that quantitative risk analysis is going to be version. 3 of your

267
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.180
Orlando Sequera: raise registers gonna help you to them.

268
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.259
Orlando Sequera: rearrange and reprioritize those risks.

269
00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:37.509
Orlando Sequera: Another important piece of information about the risk register is that every single risk that you have been able to identify has to have a risk owner.

270
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:50.089
Orlando Sequera: a associated with that risk. That is the individual that is in charge of implementing Step number 3, which is the risk response. Once we identify our risks.

271
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:59.199
Orlando Sequera: Once we analyze the risks following the qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. Step number 3 is to come up with a response.

272
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.989
Orlando Sequera: We have multiple responses. It's not just mitigation, and by mitigation I mean

273
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:13.670
Orlando Sequera: a reduced probability and impact. We have multiple responses, nor all. No, it's not always mitigation. We cover them yesterday.

274
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.180
Orlando Sequera: Please make sure that you review them. Mitigation is going to be

275
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:26.299
Orlando Sequera: useful for those risks, those negative risk or threats that are at the top of your risk register.

276
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.150
Orlando Sequera: They they have hyperly high impact. Mitigation is

277
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.059
Orlando Sequera: going to allow you to reduce that probability that impact. So.

278
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:44.039
Orlando Sequera: But if you have a risk that has low, provided low impact, then acceptance might be the best the best response so.

279
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.640
Orlando Sequera: or in some cases you have a risk that you don't really have the capability. You're building a website, and you're

280
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:57.680
Orlando Sequera: you're trying to a You try. And do you do not want to?

281
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:13.900
Orlando Sequera: A. I? Do. You do not want to take on the risk of storing credit card information because you're gonna be selling services or products in your website. Then you can transfer that to a third party. So that is, that is an example of transference. Okay, please make sure that you review the different

282
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.439
Orlando Sequera: A responses.

283
00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:25.909
Orlando Sequera: It's not just mitigation, By the way. By the way, if I was suspecting that question didn't come up. But risk elimination, is not

284
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:45.099
Orlando Sequera: It's not a possibility. It's not it's it's impossible risk. Elimination is impossible. That's why you don't see it in one of your If it's not one of the responses right, we can eliminate risk a 100%. So if you ever hear someone saying no risk, Haven't have been eliminated. 100% run. That person has no clue what they're saying.

285
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.969
Orlando Sequera: But remember, we also have responses for

286
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:59.219
Orlando Sequera: positive risks. But please make sure that you review those. So we have responses for both, and that's what we have to act on when those risks come to fruition.

287
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:05.860
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about a very important aspect, at least initially. And today we're going to continue talking about that.

288
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:11.339
Orlando Sequera: We we started talking about quality. We cover the difference between quality and great

289
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:26.200
Orlando Sequera: that this is important to understand. We talked about the standards. Briefly. We mentioned. Continuous improvement and quality is a super important aspect of project. Management is how well we deliver the requirements

290
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:46.010
Orlando Sequera: specified by the customer. Right? That's what's gonna Dictate the quality of our product of of our project, and we have standards to follow, and we there multiple theories about quality that we do follow, and by it it's an important area, an extremely important area of your project.

291
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.500
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about integration.

292
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:55.919
Orlando Sequera: So all these multiple plans, and when you hear the work plan, the chances are that we're talking about predictive

293
00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:09.359
Orlando Sequera: all these multiple plans that we are creating. They need to come together, and by that I mean your scope, management. Plan, your schedule management, plan your your your cost, management, plan your race management, plan, your quality management, plan.

294
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:22.340
Orlando Sequera: communication, management plan. They all need to be integrated. We we, we're not going to look at them as silos they all come together, and that integration happens a through the overall project management plan.

295
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:33.649
Orlando Sequera: Think of a big umbrella that Co. The ha that covers all those different subsidiary plans. They all come together because we have to manage the entire project. Not just independent silos.

296
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:37.040
Orlando Sequera: We talked about that, and then we came back for

297
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:47.889
Orlando Sequera: a part 2 of the of our sessions. Yesterday we started talking about leading the project team, covering important topics about leadership. We talked about servant leadership

298
00:32:48.360 --> 00:33:01.639
Orlando Sequera: A. A. Remember what I mentioned before. Look at the questions from the perspective of a servant leader. That is important as part of the Pmp. Mindset. I want you to remember for the Pmp. Exam. Look at those questions

299
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:06.060
Orlando Sequera: from the perspective of a servant leader as the project manager.

300
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.599
Orlando Sequera: Then we talked about collaboration and the team environment.

301
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.890
Orlando Sequera: It also tied up to

302
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.210
Orlando Sequera: You're a

303
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:30.520
Orlando Sequera: Hmm. Projecting environment and collaboration also taking into account serve and leadership out in power. The team we mentioned training, coaching, mentoring. That is important how to support a team member performance again, training, mentoring, coaching.

304
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:36.370
Orlando Sequera: call out communicating and collaboration with stakeholders. Super super super important. That is key.

305
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:43.370
Orlando Sequera: We do this regardless of the approach, whether we go predictive or agile. That is a very important aspect.

306
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:53.359
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about emotional intelligence, super important for the for the Pmp. Exam. Make sure that you

307
00:33:53.470 --> 00:34:12.439
Orlando Sequera: master the definition of emotional intelligence. Remember, we are working with people, and we can let our emotions dictate our actions. Okay, and it's a two-way street, and we also have to pay attention to how our reactions impact other people that's what we call empathy

308
00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.550
Orlando Sequera: important.

309
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:21.320
Orlando Sequera: We cover a in detail a training coach and a mentoring when it comes to training. We also learn that

310
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:30.860
Orlando Sequera: the training that we have to provide to both team members and also our stakeholders. We need to make that part of our

311
00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:36.210
Orlando Sequera: the of our efforts of our initial planning efforts, because that's gonna have.

312
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:48.619
Orlando Sequera: There is a cost associated with that training, and there is an impact on the schedule. So we need to. That's why we're taking this into account right now, because it's gonna have an impact on other areas of our project.

313
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.110
Orlando Sequera: And we wrapped up the session

314
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.989
Orlando Sequera: an extremely important topic for the Pmp. Exam.

315
00:34:55.050 --> 00:35:07.540
Orlando Sequera: That you should expect a few questions on that related to conflict management. So please make sure that you review that session. That part of the session. Really Well, we covered the different types of conflict. Remember

316
00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:11.530
Orlando Sequera: functional conflict or good conflict, or

317
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.420
Orlando Sequera: it's. Okay. That's allowed. Conflict is

318
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:25.719
Orlando Sequera: inevitable. It's unavoidable. It's going to happen because we're working with people. But functional conflict is okay. This functional conflict is bad conflict. We don't want

319
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.180
Orlando Sequera: a functional conflict conflict to escalate

320
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:42.490
Orlando Sequera: and become this functional, that, and by dysfunctional, I mean, when it's taken to a personal level. That's when problem starts to happen, and we have to monitor that flow those situations as closely as possible.

321
00:35:42.600 --> 00:36:01.429
Orlando Sequera: But you might be wondering so why do we have to allow positive conflict? Because good conflict or functional conflict when you there are disagreements, have a past different ways of doing things. That's okay, because if it's managed appropriately that fosters creativity, you might come up

322
00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:15.860
Orlando Sequera: with a better way of doing things incorporating it. That's why collaboration problem. Solving is the best way to manage conflict. Because if you can incorporate multiple viewpoints. Then you can come up with a more enhanced

323
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:24.870
Orlando Sequera: approach to solve the the the conflict and the challenges that you're trying to address whatever it is. Okay, so please review that really well.

324
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:33.440
Orlando Sequera: the different a conflict management resolution techniques that we covered. That is important for the Pmp. Exam.

325
00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:44.369
Orlando Sequera: And today we're going to cover the last 2 lessons. What we have in store for today we have a lesson. Number 5 is

326
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:52.289
Orlando Sequera: supporting projecting performance. As the work is being done. We have to support the team performance, and we're gonna go over.

327
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:58.470
Orlando Sequera: What do we have to do? How can we implement ongoing improvements thing? There's always room for for improvement.

328
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:05.180
Orlando Sequera: So what can we do to implement ongoing improvements? How can we support the team performance?

329
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.229
Orlando Sequera: Then we're going to talk about evaluating project progress

330
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:15.830
Orlando Sequera: that is important as well. We have to monitor and look at things, how things are going with our project, and if we need to make

331
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.259
Orlando Sequera: and apply any corrections.

332
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:34.429
Orlando Sequera: How do we manage project issues and impediments? That's gonna happen in every single project? So we need to be cognizant of that and address them. And then we're gonna talk in detail about something that we have been mentioning throughout the class.

333
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:41.490
Orlando Sequera: How do we manage project changes regardless of the approach? How do we do it in predictive? And how do we do it in adaptive?

334
00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:45.280
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And then we're going to wrap up the session with

335
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.219
Orlando Sequera: project, face

336
00:37:47.570 --> 00:38:01.180
Orlando Sequera: or project closure. That is important because every single project comes to an end. You can do it by face, and you can do it by the actual project, but every single product comes comes to an end. You also have to

337
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:10.239
Orlando Sequera: go back and take a look at the benefits, realization, the the benefits that we said that we plan, for did they come to fruition.

338
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.729
Orlando Sequera: and one important aspect.

339
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:22.689
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the approach Again, whether we go predictive or whether we go agile is going to be knowledge transfer that is tied up to lessons. Learn?

340
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:40.209
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that's what we have in store. I'm also gonna do my best to have a session a. Hopefully, we have a few minutes to go over final tips and recommendations for the Pmp. Exam. But I've been talking about that. But we're gonna do a summary of fully at the end

341
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:47.580
Orlando Sequera: A of the session will have enough time. I'm i'm gonna do my best to have a a few minutes to go over the exam. All right.

342
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.790
Orlando Sequera: so we are going to get started

343
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.130
Orlando Sequera: before we start with the content. I'm gonna take a look at

344
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.919
Orlando Sequera: the Q. And a. To address

345
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:07.809
Orlando Sequera: A: any questions, and we're gonna get started with the content. Okay, please remember to vote on

346
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.899
Orlando Sequera: the questions so we can.

347
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.019
Orlando Sequera: All right. So let me take a look at

348
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:23.519
Orlando Sequera: It's a question that in the Q. A. Do we have Prep. Do we have

349
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.979
Orlando Sequera: preparation Exams. Pmp. Exams offered by per CPU

350
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:47.110
Orlando Sequera: with question, examples, and so on. Yes, we do. We have. We mentioned in that from day one. If you go to percipio you log into percipio, make sure that you're in the right place. Pmp: Atp bootcamp 2021, and

351
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.449
Orlando Sequera: under practice there's gonna be on the

352
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.759
Orlando Sequera: a on the right hand on the left hand side. I'm gonna go back to that slide. We have it

353
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.870
in today's session.

354
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.350
Orlando Sequera: If you log into percipio

355
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.460
Orlando Sequera: when you log into precipice. Please make sure that you're in the right place.

356
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:15.819
Orlando Sequera: Pmp: Atp. And then you're gonna have an option that says practice to click on practice. That's what's gonna take you to test Prep: okay? So

357
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.790
Orlando Sequera: that will be

358
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.249
Orlando Sequera: the answer to that question.

359
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.060
Orlando Sequera: All right.

360
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.070
Orlando Sequera: That's a very important research for your preparation. So.

361
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:29.970
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

362
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.410
Orlando Sequera: there's another question.

363
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:58.349
Orlando Sequera: If there's a specific time block that the exam needs to be taken from attending life or no, it's tied up mostly to the application. Once your application with Pm. With Pmi has been approved, you have one year to take the exam.

364
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.250
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between mitigation plan? Mitigation is a response.

365
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:15.939
Okay.

366
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.370
Orlando Sequera: what's the difference with the mitigation plan? Contingency plan? Contingency is

367
00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.919
Orlando Sequera: a type of reserve that

368
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:30.310
Orlando Sequera: basically a set amount of money, a set amount of time that we have

369
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:49.500
Orlando Sequera: A as a buffer to address any risks that come to fruition and mitigation is a type of response, and the question is what is the difference between mitigation plan and continuously plan? Okay, Mitigation is a response. It's not a plan, and contingency is a reserve. A type of reserve is not a plan either.

370
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.069
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

371
00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:07.039
Orlando Sequera: Do you mean that any risk cannot be eliminated? 100%? Yes, or that we cannot eliminate a 100% of all the risk for a project also. Yes, both

372
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:21.439
Orlando Sequera: is the in it. Another question in the Q. A. Is the integrated Project mansion plan, typically a document that points to references to all the other subsidiary documents. That's a good way to put it. Yes.

373
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.219
Orlando Sequera: it's a learner can mandatory. Yes, by Pmi

374
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:50.979
Orlando Sequera: for Monte Carlo qualitative analysis. What kind of equipment software is needed? Specialized computers and specialized simulation software

375
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.250
Orlando Sequera: that at least very expensive thousands of dollars.

376
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.359
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

377
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.849
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the in the Q. A. When

378
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:27.269
Orlando Sequera: do you use contingency to say for man to and deserve? We mentioned that but one more time

379
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:39.259
Orlando Sequera: use contingency reserves to address any risks that were identified in the Risk Register use management reserves for for risks that were not identified

380
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:44.480
Orlando Sequera: in your project that are not in the Chris Register.

381
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.939
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

382
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.879
Orlando Sequera: I think we're getting cut up with the questions.

383
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.710
Orlando Sequera: Another question are some of the

384
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:36.399
Orlando Sequera: quantitative risk, and I said myth possible with a specialized software. My insurance is going to be. No.

385
00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:42.879
Orlando Sequera: You need specialized equipment and software for that, and it's very expensive. That's why most organizations don't

386
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.919
Orlando Sequera: do it. It's tied up to the level of complexity.

387
00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:49.929
Orlando Sequera: All right, and

388
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:58.140
Orlando Sequera: all right. So I think the rest of the questions are related to resources and technical issues. So let's get started.

389
00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.410
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

390
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.850
Orlando Sequera: we're going to talk about support theme

391
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.410
Orlando Sequera: performance

392
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.600
Orlando Sequera: about implementing, ongoing improvements supporting performance.

393
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:17.640
Orlando Sequera: evaluate project progress manage issues and impediments. And also how do we manage changes? That's what we have in store.

394
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.990
Orlando Sequera: The goal here is to learn how to

395
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:26.569
Orlando Sequera: to understand the different methods for implementing improvement.

396
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.899
Orlando Sequera: The different methods that we have available

397
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.669
Orlando Sequera: or performance measurement.

398
00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.400
Orlando Sequera: Compare these methods

399
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:40.310
Orlando Sequera: through with the main aspect that is, communication and accountability.

400
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.210
Orlando Sequera: We're going to identify methods for implementing a project.

401
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:53.319
Orlando Sequera: a project on the issues and impediments that arise during the project, how to address those issues and impediment. So the team can move forward.

402
00:45:53.330 --> 00:46:07.580
Orlando Sequera: and then we're gonna go over how to implement changes. Super important change is going to happen in every single project. Okay, so we have to have an approach on how to manage those changes.

403
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.539
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna be different in predictive compared to adaptive.

404
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:23.220
Orlando Sequera: But we have to. We have to have a strategy on how to manage those changes we have been mentioning that. But we're gonna get we're gonna do a deeper dive into the change management process

405
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.180
Orlando Sequera: all right, when it comes to implementing ongoing improvements.

406
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:34.419
Orlando Sequera: The first topic, super super super important, and most organizations are

407
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.870
Orlando Sequera: paying more more attention to that is

408
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:45.979
Orlando Sequera: a because it has impact on the quality of the work that it's been done is continuous improvement, continuous improvement

409
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:50.529
Orlando Sequera: it. This is one of the key principles

410
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.080
of agile, continuous improvement.

411
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.710
Orlando Sequera: It covers everything related to ongoing efforts. It's an ongoing effort

412
00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.180
Orlando Sequera: to improve the way we produce.

413
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:02.250
Orlando Sequera: We

414
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:16.539
Orlando Sequera: we produce products, services, or processes, and we do this through small incremental improvements, or we can do it in large breakthroughs. Okay, like we do with a with a predictive approach.

415
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:24.640
Orlando Sequera: This is a basic strategy that was developed at the organization level that is now being used at the project level.

416
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.299
Orlando Sequera: and it's usually implemented by

417
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:31.140
Orlando Sequera: a pmo. If there is a pmo in place, or

418
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:36.750
Orlando Sequera: through a structure learning approach. If the organization is following

419
00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:45.350
Orlando Sequera: a specific, continuous improvement, framework, like Agile, or it could be through the other option and implementation of 6, Sigma.

420
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.379
Orlando Sequera: and he comes from him

421
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.250
Orlando Sequera: Kaisen, which is the

422
00:47:52.480 --> 00:48:00.419
Orlando Sequera: Japanese work. Well, a couple of words Kai means change, and zen means good, so that is tied up to continuous improvement.

423
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:01.790
Orlando Sequera: And

424
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.299
Orlando Sequera: now we're going to

425
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.079
Orlando Sequera: a watch a video that is gonna help us to understand a little bit more

426
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.959
Orlando Sequera: about Kaisen.

427
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:13.639
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to.

428
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.769
Orlando Sequera: We're going to see how K. Some relates to

429
00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:17.770
Orlando Sequera: the

430
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.700
Orlando Sequera: the plan, do check act cycle

431
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.149
Orlando Sequera: in how is an evolution of that?

432
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:35.249
Orlando Sequera: So let's watch this video. Let me make sure that i'm sharing this sound, and I am. So we're gonna watch this video to learn a little bit more about this continuous improvement approach.

433
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.270
Orlando Sequera: Choose casin.

434
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.960
The lean approach to learning is very pragmatic.

435
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:54.259
Lean teams are constantly doing small experiments and analyzing the results. If there's a measurable improvement. The small change is adopted, and the team jumps into its next small experiment.

436
00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:03.720
This enables lean teams to make continuous small refinements to their processes, refinements that add up to noticeable improvements over time.

437
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:10.809
The idea is to improve through a series of small changes, a strategy. The lean community calls Kaisen

438
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.000
Japanese for improvement.

439
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:15.910
It's usually represented like this.

440
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:23.460
And while the idea is strong, most organizations need a step-by-step approach that will yield results.

441
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.889
and that looks like this.

442
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.520
Here's how it works.

443
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:31.279
First, an organization identifies potential improvement.

444
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:38.199
such as a new practice or strategy that they want to experiment with, to see how well it works in their situation.

445
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.969
Then they try it out.

446
00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.910
They implement the change

447
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.560
After a brief period they'll assess whether the change has been effective.

448
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.630
They'll measure it against clear outcomes.

449
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:53.580
If the new way of working is effective, they adopt it.

450
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.970
If it isn't, they abandon it for now, at least.

451
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.089
But they're not done

452
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:06.130
at that point. They share what they've learned with others. Other members of their team and other teams throughout their organization.

453
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.659
Then start the process over.

454
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.510
It is continuous improvement. After all.

455
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:22.350
Orlando Sequera: before we continue, this is super important for project Management Tyson Continuous Improvement. The Plan do Study Act cycle.

456
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.259
Orlando Sequera: This was developed by by Dr. Damon.

457
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.379
Orlando Sequera: Walter Damon.

458
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:32.269
Orlando Sequera: Back in the early fifties he worked, and

459
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:42.719
Orlando Sequera: he actually just a quick anecdote, because it is important. This is one of the cornerstones. By the way, if you look at the plan, do study act. That is one of the cornerstones of

460
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.979
Orlando Sequera: project management. As we know it today. It is

461
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.479
Orlando Sequera: an evolution of that actually.

462
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:59.109
Orlando Sequera: And in the plan to study at with a plan to study act as we saw with the video, we start by planning. We define the objectives and processes to deliver results.

463
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:07.850
Orlando Sequera: We do. We execute the plan, collect data to determine whether our plan has been effective or not. Then we check

464
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:11.309
Orlando Sequera: those results. We compared the data

465
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:16.930
Orlando Sequera: to what we plan for, and we make, and then we act. We make adjustments

466
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:21.500
Orlando Sequera: through to identify root causes of problems. And then

467
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:33.259
Orlando Sequera: over time there was that iteration of sharing the learning with others. So this is where project management, this continuous improvement about monitoring and controlling and improving comes from

468
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.080
Orlando Sequera: if you want to.

469
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.979
Orlando Sequera: They have an idea on how important this work was done by Dr. Damon. Quick anecdote!

470
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:52.679
Orlando Sequera: I've had the chance to read a couple of his books. Great books. One of them is out of the crisis. I was strongly suggested. You don't need that for the Pmp example quality. He's the father of total quality management.

471
00:51:53.270 --> 00:52:01.199
Orlando Sequera: And back in the fifties, just to look if this useful or not, i'm gonna give you a quick example. He went

472
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:10.130
Orlando Sequera: to the main, a back in the fifties, early fifties to the main, to the Big 3 in Detroit, the big car manufacturing companies

473
00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:15.180
Orlando Sequera: and for GM. A. And he served with them.

474
00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.300
Orlando Sequera: This approach, because this is better. They were

475
00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.470
Orlando Sequera: basically

476
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:27.829
Orlando Sequera: based in their approach, a massive production of everything, and remember the context we were. That was Post World War Ii. In.

477
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:37.770
Orlando Sequera: or at least in this country. Everything was a massive, manufacturing, massive inventories, massive amounts of parts, and

478
00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:56.859
Orlando Sequera: not really paying attention to waste, and it was about having a a ton of inventory of everything massive production. We're minimally trained workers will produce massive amounts of everything or parts, and put together an assembled cars. Nobody listen in Detroit at the time, so he ended up going to Japan.

479
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.150
Orlando Sequera: They did listen, and

480
00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:07.150
Orlando Sequera: he's regarded as one of the feathers of the Japanese miracles to recover from World War 2. So

481
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:19.179
Orlando Sequera: this works this important, and then, after a few years the big companies in Detroit Listen. They They implemented this approach, and it is widely used in many, many organizations so

482
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.879
Orlando Sequera: really important and interesting

483
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.180
Orlando Sequera: a topic

484
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:27.690
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to a continuous improvement.

485
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:29.000
Orlando Sequera: A

486
00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.979
Orlando Sequera: organizations have multiple approaches for that

487
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.850
Orlando Sequera: A one key aspect of

488
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:54.989
Orlando Sequera: continuous improvement is, and this is where more and more and more organizations are paying more attention to, because it allows them to avoid reinventing the wheel every single time they face. A similar situation is the power of the lessons to learn. That's why

489
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.679
Orlando Sequera: the lessons learned before in the past They were

490
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:14.990
Orlando Sequera: kinda looked at a a as a as a as a as something that that we don't have time for, that we we know what we're doing. We don't need to be keeping track of lessons learned. We have done in multiple times. No, there's always a way to improve this. So it's a a way to learn

491
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:15.859
Orlando Sequera: from

492
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:27.389
Orlando Sequera: the past. So it is crucial that in your projects your lessons learned register is kept up to date at all times. We don't have to wait until the end of the project, so

493
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:32.870
Orlando Sequera: it's the lessons we register up to date. That is an important aspect of continuous improvement.

494
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:50.669
Orlando Sequera: that is, if you're following a predictive approach, or if you're following an agile approach. If the team having a regular retrospective, which is a special ceremony or meeting in which the team is gonna go over exactly that they're gonna go over lessons. Learned and possible improvements

495
00:54:50.860 --> 00:55:02.690
Orlando Sequera: are the team members, Lincoln, Sigma, or Certified and Ag on method depending on the approach that we're following for continuous improvement. Do we have the knowledge that we need to have? Okay.

496
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:17.530
Orlando Sequera: Do we know about Kaisen? Do we know about lean? Do we know about crystal methods, or a Cm. That is becoming more and more prevalent. A NASA is huge, for example, when it comes to Cmi, and there are certifications that need to be in place.

497
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:32.830
Orlando Sequera: and the organizations that do work with multiple government agencies. They need to be cmi certified. Do we have a process of improve process, improvement plan in place, and the project management plan is part of that. Okay. So

498
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.010
Orlando Sequera: pay attention

499
00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:49.220
Orlando Sequera: to your organization and it try. Try to to determine whether Some of this is applicable to the work that you are to import. Continuous improvement is a big, big aspect when it comes to project management, regardless of the approach.

500
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.120
Okay.

501
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.610
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to sounds mentioned before

502
00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.240
Orlando Sequera: a mainly agile projects.

503
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:01.700
Orlando Sequera: we have

504
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.400
Orlando Sequera: a specific ceremony that we call a retrospective.

505
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:10.850
Orlando Sequera: and this is pretty much how it works. And we go over lessons learned basically

506
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:14.130
Orlando Sequera: before having the ceremony. You can

507
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:19.189
Orlando Sequera: have some topics and go because the goal here is to have to get people to talk.

508
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:30.350
Orlando Sequera: and you can start in a whiteboard with a couple of columns. What? What? When will, and what could be improved? This is not, By the way, when it comes to retrospective and lessons learn

509
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:38.400
Orlando Sequera: one huge mistake that I've seen in some organizations to start. They start. They turn this retrospective into a blaming game.

510
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:48.560
Orlando Sequera: That is not the case. The retrospective has to have a positive tone, a positive, it is a positive

511
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:59.710
Orlando Sequera: meaning, a positive ceremony in which the goal is to find improvements. What can we do to improve? So we we can go over what, when? Well.

512
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.070
Orlando Sequera: what needs to be improved. Okay, that is

513
00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:07.229
Orlando Sequera: given it the positive connotation.

514
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.819
Orlando Sequera: And you start

515
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.799
Orlando Sequera: trying to get people to talk

516
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.739
Orlando Sequera: at them. Get them to talk. Get them to talk. Well remember that's why we want to build a safe environment. So our team members

517
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:30.520
Orlando Sequera: and stakeholders can be there as well, so they can provide their input without fear of, without any fear at all. Okay. So give them time to talk, and they narrow those improvements

518
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:44.430
Orlando Sequera: and then get the team get consensus on the team that they agree that those are the positive, they, the most important improvements that we can, that we can implement in future iterations or sprint, and then

519
00:57:44.610 --> 00:58:02.549
Orlando Sequera: select a few of those possible improvements and apply them in the very next iteration. Not many, because we we still it's only 2 weeks, 3 weeks, or 4 weeks. We gotta pick the ones that are the most important, but that are going to help us to be more productive. So

520
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:06.169
Orlando Sequera: one difference, I would say, between predictive and

521
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:18.069
Orlando Sequera: agile is that imagine we can apply lessons to learn in real time with predictive. We compile our lessons, learned throughout the entire life cycle of the project.

522
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:33.639
Orlando Sequera: Even when we start identifying stakeholders, and when we are a creating, working with a sponsor in developing the product charter, we can start gathering lessons, for at that particular time throughout the entire life cycle of the project.

523
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:42.530
Orlando Sequera: but and keeping our stakeholder right, our lessons learned, register up to date, and add in more and more or less to serve as they come.

524
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.419
Orlando Sequera: But

525
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.399
Orlando Sequera: at the end of the project that's when we have

526
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.659
Orlando Sequera: a similar meeting we have. We go over lessons from

527
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.939
Orlando Sequera: that prior to closure.

528
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.979
Orlando Sequera: and our list of sort of register is going to make its way

529
00:58:55.990 --> 00:59:13.289
Orlando Sequera: to a larger repository that we call the lessons or repository, so all their projects can benefit from our lessons from. So we get to wait until the next project to start benefiting from our less concerned. If we're following a predictive approach. With that jelly is different. We're doing this one

530
00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:20.679
Orlando Sequera: one iteration at a time. In every single iteration we're going to have at the end of retrospective ceremony.

531
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.120
Orlando Sequera: But we still cover lessons from

532
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.589
Orlando Sequera: we.

533
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.149
Orlando Sequera: In addition to use less of our registers

534
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:34.679
Orlando Sequera: and retrospective, we can also

535
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:38.219
Orlando Sequera: use additional methods for improvement.

536
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:41.900
Orlando Sequera: one that is very common in marketing. For example.

537
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:47.709
Orlando Sequera: A: When you're trying to determine customer preferences is a B testing

538
00:59:48.320 --> 01:00:02.379
Orlando Sequera: when you're trying to gather feedback to identify improvements. A quick example of a. B testing. Let's assume that we're trying to create a new, a new website for the organization. We can create

539
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:08.799
Orlando Sequera: version a of the website with certain specific functionality, and we can create

540
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:18.019
Orlando Sequera: another version of the website with different functionality and give access to our users, and then we compare a to B.

541
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:22.750
Orlando Sequera: And that's how based on the feedback we're going to be able to identify

542
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.390
Orlando Sequera: the the features that

543
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:43.830
Orlando Sequera: our users in the organization will like to see in the website. So that's one way to capture that to to capture a feedback for improvement. You can perform experiments to improve team efficiency and effectiveness, and you can apply controls

544
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:50.070
Orlando Sequera: if do doing it. It's important to not to. When you're implementing or using experiments.

545
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.340
Orlando Sequera: including the AV. Testing

546
01:00:52.370 --> 01:01:07.420
Orlando Sequera: you, you you shouldn't do another experiment at the same time, otherwise your your results might might contaminate, so there might not be as effective as possible. Do you want to isolate the results? So one experiment at a time, a

547
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:08.660
Orlando Sequera: another

548
01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.429
Orlando Sequera: tool that you have available, or method

549
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:17.010
Orlando Sequera: for continuously per minute what what they call the pareto chart, or 80, 20, or the 80, 20 rule

550
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:17.870
the

551
01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:32.989
Orlando Sequera: because usually 80% of the promise come from 20% of the of the cost is we gonna we want to isolate that that 20, so we can then be specific and direct the efforts where they can make the biggest impact.

552
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.129
Orlando Sequera: And it's basically taking a big problem and breaking it down to smaller pieces. So those are ways that you also have

553
01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.180
Orlando Sequera: to improve

554
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.770
Orlando Sequera: for continuous improvement.

555
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.029
Orlando Sequera: All right.

556
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:48.879
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

557
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.109
Orlando Sequera: another

558
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:57.369
Orlando Sequera: aspect. That it's important is that we have to update our processes. Some of those lessons were might drive

559
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:04.390
Orlando Sequera: updates to certain documentation. We have to make sure that we do that, and

560
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.049
Orlando Sequera: it might update

561
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:17.149
Orlando Sequera: overall processes. It might drive some overall updates for the process that the organization has in in place. It's about continuous improvement. This is ongoing. It never ends.

562
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:35.290
Orlando Sequera: and some of the lessons learned at your project level can be applicable to every single project in the organization. That's the beauty of lessons learned that's why organizations are paying more and more attention to the lessons for an aspect of project management, because

563
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.790
Orlando Sequera: it translates into a higher efficiency

564
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:45.200
Orlando Sequera: cost savings and in in improvements across the board.

565
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:46.649
Okay.

566
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:55.329
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to unpo the chat.

567
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.650
Orlando Sequera: and to you

568
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.250
Orlando Sequera: in your organizations. Do you have

569
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:04.340
Orlando Sequera: continuous improvement, procedures or processes?

570
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:12.730
Orlando Sequera: All right. I see the some of you are saying 6, Sigma.

571
01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:18.110
Orlando Sequera: some of you are saying, may a lean some of you are saying Kaisen right? So

572
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:20.179
Orlando Sequera: all right.

573
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.000
Orlando Sequera: I'm glad to see that most of you are saying, Yes.

574
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.339
Orlando Sequera: all right. I'm going to post the chat.

575
01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.709
Orlando Sequera: Thank you for the feedback.

576
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:43.309
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to continuous improvement as as a project manager it is important that we

577
01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:46.020
Orlando Sequera: are able to learn about the different

578
01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:55.189
Orlando Sequera: a theories out there, right it is. It is important that we learn about the different theories out there. There are multiple theories. It's not just the Demings

579
01:03:55.250 --> 01:04:01.520
Orlando Sequera: theories. We have Taguchi, Crosby Smith multiple offers. So we have to

580
01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.179
Orlando Sequera: become well versed when it comes to continuous improvement.

581
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:15.029
Orlando Sequera: Educate ourselves. That's important. That's one of the aspects of project management that I enjoy the most. You get a chance to learn about so many different disciplines

582
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.019
Orlando Sequera: that are applicable and useful to the field of project management.

583
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.080
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect is.

584
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.459
Orlando Sequera: and this is widely

585
01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.569
Orlando Sequera: using in in agile.

586
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:34.450
Orlando Sequera: It's okay to fail. It's. Okay. It's okay to fail. We're navigating complexity.

587
01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:48.709
Orlando Sequera: Encourage your team to have a failed fast mentality. Let's fail. But early. So we can then change correction, change, change course as quickly as possible. It's okay to fail, but let's fail quickly and

588
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:58.089
Orlando Sequera: as early as possible, so we can then move on, make the adjustments that we have to make and move on. It's going to happen. So encourage a felt fast mindset.

589
01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:10.710
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you are able to identify all the improvements, material training, process, or equipment that you need to help your team to be more successful. That is part of being a a servant leader. By the way.

590
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:19.949
Orlando Sequera: measure the effect or impact of any change, and then remember that continuous improvement is ongoing.

591
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:28.289
Orlando Sequera: Repeat this. You start somewhere. But the it. This is a it. This is. The wheels are going to be painting. Okay, it's

592
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.829
Orlando Sequera: on on going process them repeat. So you go back

593
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.410
Orlando Sequera: to cycle in

594
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.529
Orlando Sequera: you start continuing with that.

595
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.689
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to

596
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:40.899
Orlando Sequera: the end.

597
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.720
Orlando Sequera: These are the topics that we cover. We cover continuous improvement.

598
01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:47.670
Orlando Sequera: We're talking about planning continuous improvement methods.

599
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.729
Orlando Sequera: We were able to cover the continuous information, framework.

600
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.910
Orlando Sequera: methods, procedures and tools, and recommended

601
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:59.149
Orlando Sequera: a and executing continuous improvements steps.

602
01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:08.370
Orlando Sequera: I am going to review. We're gonna take a break. We're ready for a set for first break. We're gonna take a break when we come back. I'm gonna

603
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:15.809
Orlando Sequera: answer some of the questions that we have in the Q. A. And we'll be back in 10 min. Thank you very much. Everyone

604
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.200
Orlando Sequera: welcome back everyone.

605
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.210
Orlando Sequera: We are going to continue with a class.

606
01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:29.549
Orlando Sequera: and

607
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:34.080
Orlando Sequera: before we move on I

608
01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:39.620
Orlando Sequera: like to

609
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.499
Orlando Sequera: to review the Q. A.

610
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:43.649
Orlando Sequera: For any

611
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.680
Orlando Sequera: content, related questions.

612
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.509
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the chat. Can you do a quick overview of mean crystal methods? C. M. My.

613
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.609
Orlando Sequera: we're

614
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.410
Orlando Sequera: so.

615
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:05.809
Orlando Sequera: One thing that I wanted to point out the

616
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.209
Orlando Sequera: Pmp. Exam. Has

617
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:16.019
Orlando Sequera: agile, related content. But it's not expecting you to be an agile expert. Let me start by saying that.

618
01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:31.689
Orlando Sequera: but it is important to know that there are multiple flavors of agile. Okay, it's not just from there's a common misconception out there that many people think that all agile is chrome. That is the most popular flavor of Agile.

619
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:34.039
Orlando Sequera: I will call it the chalk matter of

620
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:37.250
Orlando Sequera: agile, but it's not the only flavor

621
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.729
Orlando Sequera: we are going to talk about some

622
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.390
Orlando Sequera: The other aspects.

623
01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:47.649
Orlando Sequera: We have been mentioning continuous improvement, Kaisen.

624
01:07:47.670 --> 01:08:05.670
Orlando Sequera: but we're trying to it's it's a lot of content, right? So we're trying to focus on the most important areas for any additional information my recommendation would be, You have your reference. That's where your references might come really handy. There's a little bit more content in the address practice Guide. If you want to do

625
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.439
Orlando Sequera: a deeper dive for we're trying to focus on those important aspects.

626
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:11.740
Orlando Sequera: A of the Pmp: Exam.

627
01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:12.870
Okay.

628
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:13.810
Orlando Sequera: So

629
01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.560
cool.

630
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.810
Orlando Sequera: Let's go over

631
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.190
Orlando Sequera: additional questions.

632
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:32.120
Orlando Sequera: What risk management standards come up with Pmp. Will we cover the approach? So that Co. Was covered yesterday in detail, and we did a recap today on how

633
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.349
Orlando Sequera: it is done.

634
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:41.080
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat.

635
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.969
Orlando Sequera: How do you encourage a fail? Fast mentality

636
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.389
Orlando Sequera: by

637
01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:54.210
Orlando Sequera: tailing your team members?

638
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:59.350
Orlando Sequera: It's okay. No, we're not. Especially if we're following up

639
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.110
Orlando Sequera: an agile approach.

640
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:14.140
Orlando Sequera: It's okay. To we're gonna we're not gonna get it right right at the beginning. The scope is complex. We're gonna have. We're gonna make multiple changes. It's okay. But ideally at the beginning, as certainly as possible. If we

641
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:24.429
Orlando Sequera: if we are not a 100% successful. It's okay. We can change course. We can change corrections. That's why we're following this adaptive approach. So

642
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.450
A.

643
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:38.290
Orlando Sequera: But you're not gonna they're not gonna be able to complete all the all the user stories it it's there's a possibility. They may or may not, but it's okay that that's what we mean by fell fast.

644
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.800
Orlando Sequera: All right.

645
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:54.610
Orlando Sequera: So there's another question. So cme my crystal methods, kaisen, or has your flavors not process to use? They are agile flavors. Yes, approaches. But

646
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.780
Orlando Sequera: again.

647
01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:01.130
Orlando Sequera: to have an idea on how can they ask you about this type of

648
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:09.749
Orlando Sequera: a flavors of agile or any topic for the accent. That's why you need to take practice questions in test press. So you know

649
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:13.460
Orlando Sequera: the death of knowledge that you need to have

650
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.320
Orlando Sequera: for the Pmp. Exam. We mentioned this multiple times. The exam is

651
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:25.669
Orlando Sequera: about critical thinking. They're not going to ask you a definition. They're not going to ask you about.

652
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:34.420
Orlando Sequera: They're not going to try, and they're not trying to measure how well you know a specific topic. They're trying to determine. Can you use these tools? That's what they're

653
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.289
Orlando Sequera: looking for.

654
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.150
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

655
01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:48.230
Orlando Sequera: all right. There's another question that I see here. I want to address that When we talk about the actual Pmp: Exam. Preparation.

656
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:52.900
Orlando Sequera: One more time. The question is, Hi Orlando I'm. A precipitation

657
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:57.149
Orlando Sequera: which addition of the PIN. But do you recommend to focus on the

658
01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:02.570
Orlando Sequera: for the Pmp. Exam preparation? That is the question. And the answer is.

659
01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:12.189
Orlando Sequera: What you really need to review is the exam. Content Outline one more time. What you're gonna be tested on

660
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:20.539
Orlando Sequera: is in the exam. Content outline, not the pinboard. The ping book is one of 10 different references.

661
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:31.169
Orlando Sequera: and it's good as a reference. Okay, the PIN book is really good as a reference, but it's not a study, Guy. That's not what the PIN book is. It's a compilation of good practices, both

662
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:42.519
Orlando Sequera: both PIN box, 6 edition and seventh edition, this content that you have here. This is a distill version of all those 5,000 pages

663
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:53.290
Orlando Sequera: that have that are cover in those 10 different references. Please do not think that the Pmp. Exam. Is an exam based on the PIN book.

664
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:57.489
Orlando Sequera: All these topics. This is what you need to to master

665
01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:13.970
Orlando Sequera: the exam. Content Outline is what you need to review. The Pmp. Exam. Is based on the exam. Content outline. That's why at the end of its section. We're going over the exam. Content. Ireland. This is how we cover this sections of the exam. Content out left. So please

666
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:32.589
Orlando Sequera: please, for for one more time. The Pmp. Exam. Is not solely based on the PIN book guide. It's based on the Exam. Content Outline: okay. It's based on the exam content outline. That's what you have to review. That's the content that you're gonna be. Test those

667
01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:50.469
Orlando Sequera: a tasks that though all those are in all the different domain tasks and procedures that you see in the Exam. Continent. That's what you need to know for your Pmp. Exam. You will be tested on those not on the pinboard. Okay, alright, so let's go ahead and continue

668
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:52.190
Orlando Sequera: and we'll men. We'll.

669
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.300
Orlando Sequera: We'll review that again when we talk about the Exempt. So

670
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.080
Orlando Sequera: let's go ahead and continue.

671
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:58.240
Orlando Sequera: And

672
01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:02.750
Orlando Sequera: now we're going to talk about supporting team performance.

673
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.630
Orlando Sequera: It is really important.

674
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:15.409
Orlando Sequera: It is really, really really important to support the team in completing the work

675
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:17.990
Orlando Sequera: that needs to be completed for our project.

676
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:22.929
Orlando Sequera: You have to focus on 3 things to achieve this goal.

677
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:35.439
Orlando Sequera: to support the team in completing their work, you have to communicate and recommunicate the project objectives at all times. You also have to make sure that you have an environment.

678
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.130
Orlando Sequera: that in which they

679
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:41.650
Orlando Sequera: knowledge is flowing.

680
01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:55.760
Orlando Sequera: and that you are also working in with a healthy dynamic for the team. That's why we have to address conflict, and we cannot let comfort linger. That's why we have to act as servant leaders

681
01:13:55.770 --> 01:14:02.519
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that the team has all the materials, equipment, and supplies that they need to completely work.

682
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:10.379
Orlando Sequera: That's why we work so hard on continuous improvement, and making sure that the knowledge is sure

683
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:25.730
Orlando Sequera: we're trying to avoid single points of failure. So that's why we mentioned that previously. Okay. And whenever we have new team members, remember we're going to reset and go back to the forming stage in the talkman ladder, and we have to

684
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.089
Orlando Sequera: may have a positive approach. Welcome those new team members.

685
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.890
Orlando Sequera: We have. The oversight needed

686
01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:49.929
Orlando Sequera: a level of oversight needed to help the team to go through storming as quickly as possible. So we can get to at least Norman, and they can be productive and always, always always remember the team that the ultimate goal that we have with the project is to deliver value.

687
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:51.290
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

688
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.080
Orlando Sequera: in

689
01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:02.519
Orlando Sequera: teams are typically more productive and driven when they have clear objectives.

690
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:08.800
Orlando Sequera: That is a true statement. That is a true statement. When they know exactly where we're going.

691
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:10.289
Orlando Sequera: Teams are

692
01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:23.409
Orlando Sequera: driven, Teams are more productive. Remember you are gonna be working with highly intelligent people, and they need to know that direction. If that is ambiguous or not clear, then you're gonna have

693
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:40.100
Orlando Sequera: trouble. Okay, so it is important that we have that. We know where we're going, and that's what we do. As project managers. We we help the team in setting those goals. That's why we're working on all of this with all these different processes to

694
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:45.220
Orlando Sequera: help the team to be as productive and as successful as possible. Okay.

695
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:50.890
Orlando Sequera: project managers and the team can determine, join objectives that are challenging, yet

696
01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:54.699
Orlando Sequera: feasible. It is important that we work with feasible objectives.

697
01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:56.789
Orlando Sequera: Objective setting can be

698
01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:12.850
Orlando Sequera: a conducted at the start of a project of a face, but it's usually done throughout the life Cycle of the project. Okay, we're following a usually done at the start of a product or face if we're following a predictive approach. But it can be done throughout the life cycle of the project.

699
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.650
Orlando Sequera: A. If we're following an adaptive approach

700
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.979
Orlando Sequera: in which the team is going to set the goals and commitments for a particular timeframe, which is what we call iteration or sprint.

701
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:26.210
Orlando Sequera: But we also need to know

702
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:30.680
Orlando Sequera: the actual levels of the thresholds and tolerance levels

703
01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:40.089
Orlando Sequera: you to manage a variation without needing to escalate. That's why it's so important as a project manager that we know what is the driving

704
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.910
Orlando Sequera: constraint

705
01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:43.030
Orlando Sequera: that

706
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:49.840
Orlando Sequera: your organization has, and we have typically. That's where we have something that probably some of you have heard before.

707
01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.050
Orlando Sequera: It's about the trip

708
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.969
Orlando Sequera: train. So one of the

709
01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.730
Orlando Sequera: 3 most important constraints that any project has

710
01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.859
Orlando Sequera: are the first one is

711
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.690
Orlando Sequera: scope.

712
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:13.639
Orlando Sequera: Cope is the foundation of any project. Cope is king. Scope is everything. It is extremely important that that's why we started with scope and everything else that we build in our project

713
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:26.059
Orlando Sequera: the scope of our project. So that's one of the elements of the triple constraint. Think of it as a triangle. Then you have the other 2 are time or your schedule, and the other one is

714
01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:30.059
Orlando Sequera: money or your budget. So to think of it as a triangle.

715
01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:37.319
Orlando Sequera: and you need to understand in your organization which one is the most important constraint, is it? Is it time.

716
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.469
Orlando Sequera: in some cases that

717
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:55.099
Orlando Sequera: in some cases, some organizations that is the driving constraint we we have to deliver on time, and then what that means that in some cases all the other constraints are going to have to give in right it. Is it budget.

718
01:17:55.310 --> 01:18:05.310
Orlando Sequera: or is it scope? And then inside of that triple constraint you have quality? Okay, so this is important. We need to know the tolerances

719
01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.270
Orlando Sequera: a a. On which

720
01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:22.100
Orlando Sequera: how do when do we have to involve decision makers? Well, what is the level of tolerance. What is the the threshold that we have in this? When in with this particular a aspects or areas of our project, we need to know that. Okay?

721
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:30.140
Orlando Sequera: So we need to understand those differences, and we need to understand those thresholds. It changes from organization to organization, and it also

722
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:33.909
Orlando Sequera: A. That's why we need to understand that

723
01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.929
Orlando Sequera: organizational structure and culture as early as possible, and

724
01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:54.080
Orlando Sequera: understand what are the things that we can do internally as a team. And When do we need help from our stakeholders? This is gonna change from organization to organization, and it's gonna change from industry to industry. Okay, there's not a right or run

725
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:57.749
Orlando Sequera: a answer. When it comes to to this.

726
01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:00.760
Orlando Sequera: a a quick example it will be

727
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:07.699
Orlando Sequera: Project a has set, a tolerance. So the project manager can control any issues with the budget

728
01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:08.719
Orlando Sequera: or

729
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:12.519
Orlando Sequera: time variants that are less than 5%.

730
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:26.070
Orlando Sequera: But any variance that is more than 5% needs to be escalated because it exceeds the threshold. So any variances that are less than 5, it's okay. We can address it internally

731
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:44.780
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to money, or when it comes to a schedule. Right? Let's we're. We. We have issues with the schedule, we're taking longer, but it's with it's 5% or less. We can solve it internally as a team. I don't need to get authorization or need to get another stakeholder involved. We can solve it as a team.

732
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:47.579
Orlando Sequera: but if it's more than 5%.

733
01:19:47.800 --> 01:20:02.489
Orlando Sequera: We're overspending more than 5%, or we are delayed. The pro is delayed by more than 5%. Then we have to get someone involved. We need to know those thresholds again. Guidelines for that might come from the Pmo. If there's a pmo in place, or

734
01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.730
Orlando Sequera: it.

735
01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.179
Orlando Sequera: you can.

736
01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:20.930
Orlando Sequera: Organizations have usually that well documented. So you need to get that information. Ask a peer, another project manager that can help you to understand those variances, because that's gonna dictate. When do you have to escalate? And when can you solve it internally? That level of tolerance.

737
01:20:23.170 --> 01:20:31.110
Orlando Sequera: the project managers role? What do you do as a project manager. These answers that question, and we're talking about

738
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:33.090
Orlando Sequera: a predictive approach.

739
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:45.909
Orlando Sequera: What we do as project managers, we ally. We are going to make sure that the team is aligned with the due dates that our deliverables are produced on time.

740
01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:49.860
Orlando Sequera: and that we're following the life cycle

741
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:52.059
Orlando Sequera: a approach and

742
01:20:52.130 --> 01:21:04.749
Orlando Sequera: the benefits realization plan. So we're trying the plan that we set out for the schedule that we are allied. What is being done is align with those due dates that we have in the schedule

743
01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:16.990
Orlando Sequera: we create a project management plan. We've been talking about that. That's one of the things that we do to be able to manage every single area of our project in an organized and systematic way.

744
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:18.429
Orlando Sequera: we create

745
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.580
Orlando Sequera: a and make sure that the creation and and and use of appropriate knowledge

746
01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.040
Orlando Sequera: from the project and to the project is

747
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:27.320
Orlando Sequera: available.

748
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:35.709
Orlando Sequera: We also manage our project performance and changes to project activities. We keep, we're monitoring.

749
01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:44.530
Orlando Sequera: we're comparing our actuals. What happens in the project? That's what we call project performance to what we plan for

750
01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:51.039
Orlando Sequera: and based on those tolerances that we just mentioned, we have to make adjustments.

751
01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:51.920
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

752
01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:58.839
Orlando Sequera: and we may. It's about making decisions. We make integrated decisions about key changes that could impact the project.

753
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.330
Orlando Sequera: We

754
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:04.889
Orlando Sequera: again measure and Monitor project progress and take appropriate action.

755
01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:06.969
Orlando Sequera: We collect

756
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.489
Orlando Sequera: information about the project, and we provide

757
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:12.609
Orlando Sequera: this information

758
01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:18.589
Orlando Sequera: to stakeholders. This is where that project status report comes into play. And this is why we have

759
01:22:18.710 --> 01:22:21.980
Orlando Sequera: daily, weekly by weekly monthly.

760
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.480
Orlando Sequera: a quarterly

761
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.220
Orlando Sequera: project status meetings with our stakeholders.

762
01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.679
Orlando Sequera: We make sure this is important at the end of the at the end of the project we make sure that

763
01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:37.519
Orlando Sequera: all the product work has been completed, and we close

764
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:56.530
Orlando Sequera: the face or close the project as a whole project. Closure is important. One thing: when we, when we talk about product closure that I want you to remember, every single project needs to be closed. Everything. Your single project is going to be close. There are 2 ways that we can close the project, one that I, that ideally

765
01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:05.880
Orlando Sequera: is the most common, for most of you is when the entire product work has been completed, our deliverables have been accepted, we document lessons learned.

766
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.670
Orlando Sequera: and we

767
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.400
Orlando Sequera: clothes.

768
01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:17.550
Orlando Sequera: You need any contract items that are open. Everything is address, and probably close. All those documents are archived

769
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:35.569
Orlando Sequera: properly, and your project comes to an end or the face of a project. Another way of closing a project is through termination. Unfortunately it happens, but it still has to be properly done. Termination happens then it has to be documented the reasons for that termination, and

770
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.779
Orlando Sequera: we put the project to rest. But we always close projects, and

771
01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:53.019
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna share with you a few type of questions that you might encounter in the exam that are gonna test you exactly on that. It. So you don't fall for those for for for those little traps.

772
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:59.619
Orlando Sequera: and then we have to manage face transitions whenever necessary. This is part of George of

773
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.810
Orlando Sequera: as a project manager.

774
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:04.950
Orlando Sequera: This is something that you have to do as a Pm.

775
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.679
Okay.

776
01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.420
Orlando Sequera: And now

777
01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:12.590
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna go over some. Some of the team rose that

778
01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.849
Orlando Sequera: and responsibilities when it comes to

779
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.059
Orlando Sequera: support performance

780
01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.700
Orlando Sequera: the role in

781
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:27.799
Orlando Sequera: 1 one important aspect to keep in mind what I was mentioning before they grow the project manager. If we're following a predictive approach.

782
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:33.599
Orlando Sequera: A is fixed right. We have to do all those things, but if we are.

783
01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:38.309
Orlando Sequera: it's more common to find in a hybrid model

784
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:45.749
Orlando Sequera: that we're going to combine centralized and distributed responsibilities when it comes to support the team.

785
01:24:46.280 --> 01:25:00.800
Orlando Sequera: I think configuration and management or process for those environments in the in adaptive environments or agile environments is going to be unique, inverse in every specific context. But they're always going to be around

786
01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:12.899
Orlando Sequera: the team. Okay, so going back to the example they have that we have been using for the class. Take a look at the a response up there, roll some responsibilities in

787
01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.449
Orlando Sequera: the shops team.

788
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.539
Orlando Sequera: So in this hybrid project

789
01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:27.509
Orlando Sequera: the project manager is going to oversee Project Mansion Plan integration, but it's going to delegate control of detail for the planning and delivery to

790
01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.060
Orlando Sequera: the product owner.

791
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:31.040
Okay.

792
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:32.370
Orlando Sequera: in

793
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:44.799
Orlando Sequera: they blank is going to focus on building a cross-functional team a collaborative decision making environment and ensuring that the team can respond to changes. That's going to be

794
01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.279
Orlando Sequera: the project manager. Okay?

795
01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.729
Orlando Sequera: And the process rolled off.

796
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:54.060
Orlando Sequera: Blank it's gonna help the team to understand the Add-on mindset

797
01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.370
Orlando Sequera: and use chrome processes

798
01:25:56.650 --> 01:26:01.150
Orlando Sequera: that is going to be your scrum master or add your coach

799
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.709
Orlando Sequera: A. To develop the

800
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.230
Orlando Sequera: A.

801
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:09.179
Orlando Sequera: It shops lifestyle center product.

802
01:26:09.370 --> 01:26:13.380
Orlando Sequera: The blank is the local domain expert that plans

803
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.230
Orlando Sequera: how to do the work

804
01:26:15.490 --> 01:26:19.749
Orlando Sequera: and the blank looks after valuation. So

805
01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.850
Orlando Sequera: the team is the local domain expert

806
01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:33.140
Orlando Sequera: that plans how to do the work. It's always a team, and the product owner is going to look after value Creation, because it is individual in charge of

807
01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:39.240
Orlando Sequera: the scope of the project. Okay, this is for this hybrid approach, as you can see

808
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:42.899
Orlando Sequera: in the predictive approach. I'm gonna go back One slide

809
01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.490
Orlando Sequera: in the predictive approach is more

810
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:53.249
Orlando Sequera: is centralized. This is for predictive, centralized. These are

811
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.809
Orlando Sequera: they? These tasks cannot be delegated. But if we're following a hybrid approach.

812
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:05.720
Orlando Sequera: the project manager is going to work with. Some of the tasks are going to be up to the project manager, but we have the team involved.

813
01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.800
Orlando Sequera: and if we're working with the owner, we

814
01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:15.160
Orlando Sequera: get their assistance and help as well. So that's how it works in a hybrid approach in a

815
01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:19.389
Orlando Sequera: pure adaptive approach is is mostly going to be around the team.

816
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:23.539
Orlando Sequera: Okay, Their team focused those capabilities and responsibilities.

817
01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.169
Orlando Sequera: One key aspect

818
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:30.990
Orlando Sequera: that is going to help us

819
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.569
Orlando Sequera: to support the performance

820
01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.139
Orlando Sequera: is

821
01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.279
Orlando Sequera: again about communication

822
01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:39.800
Orlando Sequera: communication within the team.

823
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:40.650
Orlando Sequera: so

824
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.070
Orlando Sequera: it is super important to use the retrospectives.

825
01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:51.029
Orlando Sequera: These pacific ceremonies that we have at the end of each iteration in which we go about what one will.

826
01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:57.690
Orlando Sequera: what when, what, what can be improved? That is important, that we discuss, and we're going to find

827
01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:04.279
Orlando Sequera: ways to communicate better. We' to pay close attention to those possible improvements on how to communicate better as a team

828
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:11.160
Orlando Sequera: we should communicate in group settings and face to face settings whenever possible. Make communication

829
01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:30.110
Orlando Sequera: positive and regular with internal stakeholders, team members, and also external stakeholders, and use the technology and tools that you have available within the organization and gather feedback. It is super super super important that you pay attention to those lessons. Learn about communication

830
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:44.569
Orlando Sequera: and going back to that question, Where do we have those expectations about communication for the team? They're gonna be in the team Charter. That's why we created that as a team.

831
01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:57.850
Orlando Sequera: Okay, not to add a burden to the team we created that so everybody knows. We meet every day at 80 at 8 am. Before we start the work day. Our working hours are from 8 am. To 5 Pm.

832
01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:17.710
Orlando Sequera: If anyone a voicemail has to be returned within 30 min, an email has to be replied within 30 min. A message in the in the communications in the Channel in Microsoft teams has to be answered within

833
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.649
Orlando Sequera: 30 min, etc. All that's going to be spelled out in the team charter.

834
01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:27.880
Orlando Sequera: and

835
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:30.939
Orlando Sequera: a key aspect is

836
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.000
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to supporting high performance is feedback.

837
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:36.599
Orlando Sequera: Feedback is

838
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:40.200
Orlando Sequera: crucial communication, and it has to be done regularly

839
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:47.169
Orlando Sequera: in both directions. It's not just it. It it's also for us as Pm. Right, we. They're always ways to

840
01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:54.780
Orlando Sequera: to improve in both directions, and we can give and receive feedback and give feedback to your team, meaning that

841
01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:08.619
Orlando Sequera: they're gonna listen to you and vice versa. Right? It's not just it's not a it's not a one way street. It has to be a 2 way street. They can give you a feedback on how to. Maybe if we did. If if you did this way, the the if you kept this.

842
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:21.249
Orlando Sequera: if you did, this processes this way as the Pm. Maybe it's gonna be more beneficial to the team. So you also have to. You're gonna get feedback from the team. As well communicate in detail about

843
01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.660
Orlando Sequera: technical

844
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:33.510
Orlando Sequera: performance aspects and soft performance aspects. We have to be specific. We have to be very specific, and we have to use the right approach sometimes.

845
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:53.129
Orlando Sequera: and this is my rule of thumb is, if it's about performance of an individual. I do that in an individual setting. I'm not going to do that in public right? So we. But if it's about recognition, someone date When I gave positive feedback to one of my team members, i'm going to make sure that not only the team members. Everyone everyone in the organization knows

846
01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.320
Orlando Sequera: about that going back to recognition right? So

847
01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:07.390
Orlando Sequera: a little bit of common sense. But make sure that you follow the best approach for that. Give the feedback in the timely manner. Don't. Wait, don't wait No.

848
01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:12.479
Orlando Sequera: Give the feedback that that's that's gonna help you, and do it as regularly as needed.

849
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:17.960
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect that is important to keep in mind is to be able

850
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:20.490
Orlando Sequera: to support our

851
01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.370
Orlando Sequera: teams accountability. We have been

852
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:29.060
Orlando Sequera: saying that ideally we want our team to

853
01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:31.479
Orlando Sequera: take charge from what they're doing.

854
01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:36.330
Orlando Sequera: Imagine in adaptive. It's a Must. Teams are self-organized and self-managed.

855
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:48.910
Orlando Sequera: but in predictive it's it's the trend. We are encouraging them to be more self organized when it comes to the work that has to be done, how to do the work, who should do the work.

856
01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:49.830
Orlando Sequera: but

857
01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:59.840
Orlando Sequera: that we have to have ways to promote visibility and collaboration. This is only going to work if everybody is pulling their weight, and

858
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:07.420
Orlando Sequera: by that I mean with great power comes great responsibility, and we have to have ways to

859
01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:12.350
Orlando Sequera: A, or we use tools that are gonna help us to promote that

860
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:23.459
Orlando Sequera: level of accountability, and that comes with transparency. One way is to use what we call Camden Board, which is a graphic representation of the word

861
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:27.319
Orlando Sequera: of the work that is being done in different columns and

862
01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:38.849
Orlando Sequera: quick example here that we see in the picture, even though we Don't have any legends. But these are the different states of the work. Let's assume that the first column is. These are the items that are in the to do list.

863
01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:42.189
Orlando Sequera: and these are features that need to be completed by the team.

864
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:48.499
Orlando Sequera: the the column in the middle. We can assume that is, these are the items that are being worked on by the team

865
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.639
Orlando Sequera: right now.

866
01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.429
Orlando Sequera: and the last column are the items. For example, right?

867
01:32:53.580 --> 01:33:00.170
Orlando Sequera: This can change it. You can modify, add, remove, change, whatever the

868
01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:08.250
Orlando Sequera: whatever titles make sense to your specific situation. Maybe the last column, we can say that these are the items that are complete.

869
01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:15.820
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So this helps with visibility, transparency collaboration, and, more importantly, with that

870
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:18.380
Orlando Sequera: accountability with our team members.

871
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.860
Orlando Sequera: Another important

872
01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.950
Orlando Sequera: tool that we have available

873
01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:31.409
Orlando Sequera: to get everyone on the same page on. Who's doing? What is the racing matrix?

874
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:35.960
Orlando Sequera: And remember what we said yesterday. The racing matrix is

875
01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:39.009
Orlando Sequera: one way is one tool that we have

876
01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:56.329
Orlando Sequera: to help us to minimize conflict as much as possible. One of the main it causes of conflict in project management in project teams is lack of clarity when it comes to rolls and responsibilities. This is why we create a race, a matrix. We don't do it just to

877
01:33:56.340 --> 01:34:04.310
Orlando Sequera: a just because we do it. We create it to help us, and that's how it's going to help us. So.

878
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:07.969
Orlando Sequera: And it also helps with accountability.

879
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.919
Orlando Sequera: We to make sure that everyone knows what they're gonna be doing

880
01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.600
Orlando Sequera: in the project

881
01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:14.780
Orlando Sequera: for

882
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:21.769
Orlando Sequera: racy comes from a. They are stands for responsible. Who is the individual that is going to be doing the work

883
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:26.999
Orlando Sequera: or individuals, it can be more than one depending on the task who is accountable.

884
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:37.470
Orlando Sequera: and it's usually one. It's gonna be one person. And, by the way, the accountable responsible. We don't want to have the same individuals. So the difference between the 2

885
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.779
Orlando Sequera: is that the account

886
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:45.739
Orlando Sequera: party, if the individual has to make sure that the task gets done.

887
01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:50.200
Orlando Sequera: For example, we have a task of

888
01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:55.330
Orlando Sequera: installing exterior windows for a one our one story house

889
01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:03.720
Orlando Sequera: responsible party. We have 2 individuals, and then the project manager is the accountable party.

890
01:35:04.050 --> 01:35:04.870
Orlando Sequera: If

891
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:06.710
Orlando Sequera: the task

892
01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:09.180
Orlando Sequera: doesn't get done on time.

893
01:35:09.850 --> 01:35:22.810
Orlando Sequera: the person that has to answer for that is the project manager, not the 2 individuals that were assigned to the task. Why didn't get this? Why didn't? Why wasn't this task complete on time? Well.

894
01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:41.890
Orlando Sequera: if the accountable party that has to provide the explanation. There might be a valid explanation. I'm not say that it doesn't happen it happens all the time. There might be a valid reason for that. But we need to understand who's going to be that kind of the accountable party. Those are these he's, or her neck on the line. They have to provide that explanation

895
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:47.409
Orlando Sequera: if the task doesn't get complete in time. Okay. But we also have

896
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:52.450
Orlando Sequera: consult the C stands for consult. We? This is where we involve experts.

897
01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:53.830
Orlando Sequera: Maybe this

898
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:57.270
Orlando Sequera: windows are special. There are

899
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:11.560
Orlando Sequera: high great windows, or they're using a new technology. That is.com. We need to consult an expert, maybe someone from a third party, company, etc. That can help us with this specific type of window and then

900
01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.219
Orlando Sequera: inform some stakeholders

901
01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:16.930
Orlando Sequera: would like to be kept in the loop

902
01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:22.209
Orlando Sequera: to know what's going on with those particular tasks, and that's what we mean by inform

903
01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:28.770
Orlando Sequera: A. In a predictive setting. The race is gonna be created by the project manager. But if your phone

904
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:32.180
Orlando Sequera: approach it's either the project manager or the team lead.

905
01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:39.499
Orlando Sequera: also known as the per master that is going to be working with the team in in regards to roles and responsibilities.

906
01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:40.630
Okay.

907
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.590
Orlando Sequera: hey? Also.

908
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:54.789
Orlando Sequera: we have to focus on knowledge as a team asset. This is important to support the team, but it can be often

909
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.320
Orlando Sequera: a overlooked

910
01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:58.210
Orlando Sequera: a knowledge.

911
01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:03.230
Orlando Sequera: As we know. We have been mentioning that before a.

912
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:18.780
Orlando Sequera: we have 2 types of knowledge. Basically we have explicit knowledge. This is whatever we can codify and can put in a document, and it's very easy to understand. We can document it, we can use it and retrieve it to collaborate. But we also have

913
01:37:19.230 --> 01:37:22.119
Orlando Sequera: tacit knowledge or tribal knowledge.

914
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.110
Orlando Sequera: This is what comes with experience.

915
01:37:25.130 --> 01:37:42.460
Orlando Sequera: This is hard to articulate, like teaching someone how to play a musical instrument, for example, or or how to to work within the organization. Imagine if you are a new project manager, a new organization, and there is another project manager that has been there for many, many years, that it

916
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:45.179
Orlando Sequera: to a. As we say here in the State, to

917
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:57.100
Orlando Sequera: probes of your the organization that tribal knowledge is, it's not going to be found in any. It comes with experience, and you're going to develop your own. A tacit knowledge for this

918
01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:59.880
Orlando Sequera: experience. It's about

919
01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:15.779
Orlando Sequera: the best practices, etc., but it's also a type of knowledge. So we have to treat knowledge as an asset, not only to the team and the organization, and we do that with lessons learn. We document that with lessons learned as much as possible.

920
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:20.040
Orlando Sequera: and

921
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:23.290
Orlando Sequera: for that reason it is important, too.

922
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:30.829
Orlando Sequera: Incorporate as much as possible opportunities for knowledge. Transfer. This can be done through networking

923
01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:39.649
Orlando Sequera: A. We can have in some cases something that is called a community of practice, which is a group of

924
01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:49.380
Orlando Sequera: people that get together, and they want to learn more for a about a specific topic, for example, agile they want to. They get together.

925
01:38:50.210 --> 01:38:58.009
Orlando Sequera: and companies are promoting and fostering this more and more and more to a help their

926
01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:07.260
Orlando Sequera: team members and employees to learn more about specific topics that are gonna be beneficial to the entire organization. It could be business analysis. It could be public speaking.

927
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:22.850
Orlando Sequera: It could be a adjunct, for example, so, or something that is going to help the organization. And these communities are practice. They people that would like to learn more about those topics they get together, and they start sharing knowledge. Another example is

928
01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:27.340
Orlando Sequera: your If you're a member of Pmi, your local Pmi chapter.

929
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:36.699
Orlando Sequera: It's an example of a community of practice, and in this case it will be the topic will be project management. But it could also be in in meetings, seminars

930
01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.660
Orlando Sequera: through training.

931
01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:40.950
Orlando Sequera: and even it

932
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:53.269
Orlando Sequera: Job, shadowing or work, shadowing just pairing people that are experience with their people that are starting their career in a specific field, so they can learn and increase the level of knowledge. Okay.

933
01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:55.829
Orlando Sequera: so knowledge is important

934
01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:58.889
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to knowledge management.

935
01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.420
Orlando Sequera: This has 3 levels.

936
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:08.069
Orlando Sequera: We have it at the individual level, which is mainly what we're gonna be focusing on in our

937
01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:19.460
Orlando Sequera: E with the project team members. This is where the each team member individually, they learn the knowledge through either research, collaboration or training and working with other team members.

938
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:23.630
Orlando Sequera: We have knowledge management at the project level.

939
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:26.969
Orlando Sequera: What's needed to complete

940
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:28.260
Orlando Sequera: to

941
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:29.660
Orlando Sequera: for the growth.

942
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:34.120
Orlando Sequera: And we're going to transfer this knowledge from other projects

943
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:42.499
Orlando Sequera: you in. Let's just learn from other projects. And we're also going to check in with the project management office. If we have one available

944
01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:43.630
Orlando Sequera: and

945
01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:48.309
Orlando Sequera: the higher level of knowledge management is at the organizational level.

946
01:40:48.840 --> 01:41:01.039
Orlando Sequera: This is what's needed to manage collections of projects and pro and and programs that we call portfolios, and also collections of projects that we call programs as we cover on day one

947
01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:08.429
Orlando Sequera: and these are. This is knowledge that can be applied at the organizational level. That's why those

948
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.749
Orlando Sequera: not it. A lessons learned repositories

949
01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.580
Orlando Sequera: are going to be.

950
01:41:13.650 --> 01:41:15.849
Orlando Sequera: They are so useful because

951
01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.429
Orlando Sequera: the entire organization can benefit

952
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:22.300
Orlando Sequera: from those noted lessons from repositories.

953
01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:27.500
Orlando Sequera: So

954
01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.680
Orlando Sequera: at this point in your project. When the work is being done.

955
01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:47.260
Orlando Sequera: it is important to keep your team motivated. It is to it is important to work a motivation. Okay, this is where this is a make or break moment for any project that work is being done. People are working, so Don't let. If

956
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:57.480
Orlando Sequera: e I've seen it in many cases that we start team predicting starts, for they start very strong with the kick off, and everybody's a excited about the project.

957
01:41:57.870 --> 01:42:10.690
Orlando Sequera: But then, when we start the project work, we we encounter some challenges, and then the level of motivation starts increasing. It is our job as project managers to keep the team motivated so, for that is

958
01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:19.230
Orlando Sequera: important to motivate the team, Motivate the team, provide. Opportunity is, do not impose obligations. Right.

959
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.910
Orlando Sequera: Give them feedback.

960
01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.330
Orlando Sequera: Make sure, if you're working with

961
01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:30.239
Orlando Sequera: a with with a virtual team setting, make sure that you are there with them, that you are

962
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:34.650
Orlando Sequera: providing that oversight, helping them. Being a through server leader.

963
01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:49.590
Orlando Sequera: hey? Making sure that if they're a experience and difficulties, make sure that you are there to help them to navigate those challenges, give them the training opportunities might be that, remember, I have never seen in my in

964
01:42:50.220 --> 01:43:08.369
Orlando Sequera: close to 20 years now I've never seen any situation in which right of the get go. We have all this skill set that is needed. Our team members have to either self, through self learning, have to learn some of the skill set, or they have to be sent to training. And the more complex the the scope.

965
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.689
Orlando Sequera: the the worse it gets. So

966
01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.070
Orlando Sequera: give them training opportunities. Okay, and also

967
01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:33.619
Orlando Sequera: have those moments for to to to reassess, to self, to self, assess and reflect on what can be done better? How can we overcome these challenges, so be supportive. Be there to motivate your team. You're the main tier leader for your team.

968
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:45.609
Orlando Sequera: Please do not here. The first one, the first one. I have seen this more often than not, especially with project managers that are new to project management

969
01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:50.290
Orlando Sequera: do not become a hindrance to your team. Do not

970
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:52.539
Orlando Sequera: overwhelmed them with meetings.

971
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.870
Orlando Sequera: Do not overwhelm them with work interruptions.

972
01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:06.249
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna give you. Actually, i'm gonna ask you quickly. How long do you think that it takes in average

973
01:44:06.450 --> 01:44:07.280
Orlando Sequera: for

974
01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:22.809
Orlando Sequera: the average person to be productive when they start working on a complex task. How long do you think it takes for someone to start productive when they start working a complex task in minutes.

975
01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:25.260
Orlando Sequera: And i'm gonna open up the chat so.

976
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.140
Orlando Sequera: for the chat is open. Okay.

977
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.460
Orlando Sequera: all right.

978
01:44:38.730 --> 01:44:50.829
Orlando Sequera: All right. I'm going to post the chat, so some of you get it. It tastes about 45 min in average. Some people might take less. Some people might take a little bit more more, but in average takes

979
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:57.960
Orlando Sequera: that's close to an hour, right? So imagine every time. If if our team members are working in a complex task

980
01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:03.019
Orlando Sequera: Every time that we interrupt our team, the clock resets

981
01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.890
Orlando Sequera: and they have to

982
01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:24.330
Orlando Sequera: go back. So so the the product productivity is is is is is lost tremendously. That's why we do not want to overwhelm them with working interruptions. That's why we, as the Pm. We're the spokesperson of the team any, and this goes not only to you. This goes to

983
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:41.619
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders. They might call directly the team members and ask questions. Nope. You have to educate your stakeholders that if they need an information about the project they come to you. You are the point of contact. This the main point of contact for the project team is

984
01:45:41.650 --> 01:45:59.110
Orlando Sequera: the Pm: okay. If it's an agile team, it will be the team, lead or scrum master mainly. But if it's a if it's a predict. If you follow it, a predictive approach, it will be the project manager, or even in an adaptive approach. If you're working with a product manager. It can be shared between the

985
01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:04.610
Orlando Sequera: the team, lead the scrum master and the project manager, but not the team members. Okay.

986
01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:20.249
Orlando Sequera: do not distract them with none project work and do not force group activities. Do not be a hindrance to your teams, as I mentioned before in this, more often than not, unfortunately, and that's something that we have to learn.

987
01:46:20.830 --> 01:46:22.559
Orlando Sequera: And we have to educate

988
01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:25.210
Orlando Sequera: your stakeholders

989
01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.490
Orlando Sequera: that with

990
01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:33.320
Orlando Sequera: provide them with that awareness that we need to let the people that are doing the work. We need to let them do the work. Okay.

991
01:46:34.710 --> 01:46:36.879
Orlando Sequera: all right.

992
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.410
Orlando Sequera: And also it is important to

993
01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:49.190
Orlando Sequera: keep the team focus on delivering value that is really important. Prioritize coherence and collaboration and consensus that is crucial.

994
01:46:49.330 --> 01:46:51.689
Orlando Sequera: Keep the talkman letter

995
01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:52.960
Orlando Sequera: in my

996
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.889
Orlando Sequera: If there are changes to your team team members

997
01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:11.430
Orlando Sequera: leave, and people people get promoted. People leave people with people get laid off, new people come in, so that happens, change is going to happen. You have to provide the oversight to your team

998
01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:17.210
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that they navigate through that 4 min storming stages as quickly as possible.

999
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:20.670
Orlando Sequera: Welcome team member new team members

1000
01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:33.619
Orlando Sequera: with a positive in in a positive way they there is new experience, and and there, that's a source of new knowledge. So welcome them with with open arms, and also make sure that they understand

1001
01:47:33.650 --> 01:47:36.290
Orlando Sequera: the prior goals and agreements. That team charter.

1002
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:40.959
Orlando Sequera: collaborate, collaborate with them how to how they can find and add value.

1003
01:47:41.670 --> 01:47:43.950
Orlando Sequera: and navigate any disruptions

1004
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.829
Orlando Sequera: and conflict constructively.

1005
01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:50.929
Orlando Sequera: You also have to

1006
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.309
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you keep

1007
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.440
Orlando Sequera: your artifacts that you have been created

1008
01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:00.820
Orlando Sequera: up to date.

1009
01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:05.400
Orlando Sequera: Are your compliance and practice standards for artifact maintenance of

1010
01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:15.220
Orlando Sequera: gonna ask that question. That is also part of continuous improvement. Make sure that you are that you have those artifacts in place. Make sure that you're

1011
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.889
Orlando Sequera: project

1012
01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.269
Orlando Sequera: artifacts and documentation is up to date

1013
01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:30.110
Orlando Sequera: and make sure that you are using any guidelines a that are needed. If, for example, if you're working with

1014
01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:31.400
Orlando Sequera: a

1015
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:51.050
Orlando Sequera: any European country, make sure that you or any other country part of the European Union, I should say, and the information and you're working is sharing information, and your you have offices over there. Make sure that you are. G Gdp are compliant, for example, or if you're working with

1016
01:48:51.060 --> 01:49:01.610
Orlando Sequera: your project, has to do with health care here in the Us. I'm. Sure that in in some European countries they have similar regulations of a patient, a

1017
01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:02.690
Orlando Sequera: protection.

1018
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:17.459
Orlando Sequera: A. Here is known as Hipaa Law. You gotta make sure that you are compliant with that, and your artifacts are maintained, and they are compliant with any regulation that is applicable. That's why I would review Opas and enterprise environmental factors.

1019
01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:19.309
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so

1020
01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:25.489
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you keep your your file storage and organize and version it comes with. We have

1021
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:35.709
Orlando Sequera: version, control and a configuration management. Make sure that you're compliant with any data protection, any any leg leg legislation, any loss, and it regulations.

1022
01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.080
Orlando Sequera: and make sure that you maintain your artifacts in preparation

1023
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:46.960
Orlando Sequera: for archiving. This happens at the end of your project. Those artifacts are going to be leveraged in the future for other projects.

1024
01:49:47.630 --> 01:49:48.320
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1025
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.490
Orlando Sequera: So what we have cover so far is

1026
01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.139
Orlando Sequera: we have talked about

1027
01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:56.289
Orlando Sequera: how to manage communications effectively.

1028
01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:02.199
Orlando Sequera: providing information and updates effectively empowering team members and stakeholders.

1029
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:03.779
Orlando Sequera: building a team.

1030
01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:06.230
Orlando Sequera: engaging and supporting virtual teams.

1031
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:12.809
Orlando Sequera: managing project artifacts and determine the properties of mythology, methods, and practices.

1032
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:14.760
Orlando Sequera: This these are the

1033
01:50:14.850 --> 01:50:25.399
Orlando Sequera: Exam. Content outline. Remember what you need to what you're gonna be tested on in the Pmp. Exam. This is how this content is aligned to the Exam. Content Outline

1034
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.749
Orlando Sequera: All right, and

1035
01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:37.020
Orlando Sequera: before we move on with the next topic which is evaluating Project progress. I'm. Going to take a look at

1036
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:39.429
Orlando Sequera: the

1037
01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.850
Orlando Sequera: questions that are in the Q. And a.

1038
01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:05.149
Orlando Sequera: So question, please explain the difference between scope and objective scope is the work that you have to complete in your project in order to produce

1039
01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:06.710
Orlando Sequera: a

1040
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:19.270
Orlando Sequera: they deliverables associated with the objectives. Your rejects are part of the vision of the project. Right? What you're trying to deliver. But the scope is, they work that you have to complete to produce

1041
01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:20.860
Orlando Sequera: the requirements

1042
01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:22.789
Orlando Sequera: of your project

1043
01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:34.959
Orlando Sequera: Another question: what is an example of a project? Status report?

1044
01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.909
Orlando Sequera: Well, you have.

1045
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:41.529
Orlando Sequera: We didn't have any one of the slides you have?

1046
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:48.170
Orlando Sequera: Usually you call it. The pen depends on the interest on the on the organization, on the industry, but it is a report in which your

1047
01:51:48.180 --> 01:52:08.139
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna be reporting status on on what reporting status on the schedule of your project. So you might have milestones, and you can show a percentage of completion against those mountains of your project. You're gonna show the financials how well your budget is doing right where you are with some metrics that we're going to cover

1048
01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:14.249
Orlando Sequera: a little bit later about project progress, right? What? You're gonna You're gonna be using a for

1049
01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:27.910
Orlando Sequera: your budget. You're gonna be using your cost performance index, which is a metric that shows how healthy your project budget is. And then for the scheduled use another metric that is called scheduled Performance index, so

1050
01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:35.950
Orlando Sequera: that, and then another section commonly found in most project status reports is going to be about risks.

1051
01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.399
Orlando Sequera: You have to with register any risk that materialize what is being done. Okay.

1052
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:44.179
Orlando Sequera: But Of course, that is

1053
01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.889
Orlando Sequera: just an example.

1054
01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:48.699
Orlando Sequera: It can change.

1055
01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.660
Orlando Sequera: Can you elaborate on make integrated decisions

1056
01:52:59.570 --> 01:53:12.960
Orlando Sequera: about key changes that impact the project well and make decisions on key changes, changes to the scope, changes to the schedule changes to the to the budget going through the integrated change control process.

1057
01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:23.440
Orlando Sequera: because the in there are integrated decisions because they're going to impact every single area of your project. So that's how the decision making process it has to be holistic.

1058
01:53:25.290 --> 01:53:32.779
Orlando Sequera: Every decision that we make is going to have an impact on every. It is going to have a an impact on their tire. The entire project

1059
01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:40.450
Orlando Sequera: There's a question artifact question.

1060
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:44.420
Orlando Sequera: Does the risk management plan get updated when a risk has passed?

1061
01:53:45.630 --> 01:53:47.110
Orlando Sequera: A.

1062
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:50.740
Orlando Sequera: I think that you mean when a risk has occurred?

1063
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:51.639
Orlando Sequera: Probably

1064
01:53:52.290 --> 01:54:02.649
Orlando Sequera: example, brick prices may be high, and then the bricks were procure at a good price. So there's no longer a risk here.

1065
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:12.269
Orlando Sequera: Update something. Your that is more an assumption than a risk.

1066
01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:16.500
Orlando Sequera: So I would say, in that case I will update my assumptions.

1067
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:18.320
Orlando Sequera: A.

1068
01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:27.269
Orlando Sequera: Maybe I had the assumption that Rick Prices were going to be at a good price. Now, we'll update my assumption, not break. Prices are a increasing. That's what I would do.

1069
01:54:32.210 --> 01:54:33.860
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1070
01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.380
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

1071
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:41.280
Orlando Sequera: When team members have very different functions that change with tasks.

1072
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:58.700
Orlando Sequera: Then that's the race. You need to be a live document to show the new task actions that get added. Yes, If you incorporate new tasks, make sure that you incorporate that you decide who's going to be responsible for it's going to be a kind of one who needs to be consulted. Who needs to be informed? Ask you.

1073
01:54:58.710 --> 01:55:02.839
Orlando Sequera: update the races. So the race is gonna it's also a living document.

1074
01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:16.389
Orlando Sequera: Another question. If you're working on multiple functions, and you are overseeing a team that has projects and operational work. Is there anything you suggest

1075
01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:24.719
Orlando Sequera: like? Should we help them to organize? So just to to remove the operational work as much as possible. No.

1076
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:28.639
Orlando Sequera: this my recommendation in that situation.

1077
01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:44.320
Orlando Sequera: a work with the functional manager. Okay, this happens all the time. So work with the functional manager to understand the availability of the resources they are going. You have to go through negotiation through that.

1078
01:55:44.410 --> 01:55:58.940
Orlando Sequera: They gotta do their operational work, and they also gotta work on the project. But you need to understand what percentage of availability do you have with your resources? Is it 50% of their time? Is it a 20% of their time

1079
01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:04.530
Orlando Sequera: on a weekly basis? So work with your functional manager to understand resource availability.

1080
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.139
Orlando Sequera: Another question: Will team members vacation, time be considered? Risk?

1081
01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:23.569
Orlando Sequera: No, not necessarily we. This is why we do resource planning, and one aspect of resource. Planning is resource calendars.

1082
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:28.570
Orlando Sequera: and in the resource calendar you shouldn't have information in

1083
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:40.999
Orlando Sequera: that will tell you when resources are available, including people when they take vacation. This has to be up to date. So you don't schedule a task to be done when someone is on vacation, so that that's something that you shouldn't.

1084
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:44.530
Orlando Sequera: that that's something that you can plan for you. Shouldn't be at risk.

1085
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:47.299
Orlando Sequera: You can control that.

1086
01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:54.069
Orlando Sequera: What does the termination documentation look like when we get to term to pro your closure. We'll talk about. That

1087
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:10.610
Orlando Sequera: is the knowledge management you are talking about normally managed by the Organization's Knowledge manager, or are they 2 different things by the same name. Well.

1088
01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:25.839
Orlando Sequera: if you have in your organization and knowledge management manager, they are going to help with this knowledge. So yes, if you have one in in your organization. They're going to be working with this that that we mentioned. But in some cases they don't all the organizations don't have it.

1089
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.170
Orlando Sequera: What do you

1090
01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.330
Orlando Sequera: same thing?

1091
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:40.579
Orlando Sequera: Curate knowledge applies in all product types. Yes, the Pmo. What's responsible in

1092
01:57:41.010 --> 01:57:50.500
Orlando Sequera: for archive in the info, if it's predictive? Yes, a 100. But if we're following up on an adaptive approach, we can get help from team members.

1093
01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:08.010
Orlando Sequera: But you mentioned setting up rules in the communications are not in the communication charter in the team. Charter

1094
01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:23.859
Orlando Sequera: return calls within 30 min respond to text. By this time I feel all that contradicts do not not disrupt productivity. No, it doesn't contradict, because you're gonna set blocks right. You can plan your work to understand that

1095
01:58:24.670 --> 01:58:28.410
Orlando Sequera: you can plan your work, but you can set

1096
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:33.170
Orlando Sequera: time during the day between. For example, this is what I do

1097
01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:35.749
Orlando Sequera: between 8 and

1098
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:41.470
Orlando Sequera: 10 am. This is something that I have done, not what I regularly do. But I said, blocks of time

1099
01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:45.470
Orlando Sequera: from 8 to 10 we have all the meetings

1100
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:47.789
Orlando Sequera: that we need to have, and then

1101
01:58:48.110 --> 01:59:06.149
Orlando Sequera: n to 12. For example, team members are gonna be working and they they are not gonna get disrupted. They're gonna be working. And then from and when they come back from lunch from one to 3. For example, they are not gonna get disrupted, so you can divide the work in the

1102
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:18.629
Orlando Sequera: with your teams, so they are able to to be productive, depending on what they're doing. But you can plan a an account for that. So it so. You minimize disruptions as much as possible.

1103
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.639
Orlando Sequera: I was just giving examples about

1104
01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:23.889
Orlando Sequera: the

1105
01:59:24.150 --> 01:59:26.110
Orlando Sequera: the the 30 min

1106
01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:28.020
Orlando Sequera: it's just it was just an example.

1107
01:59:30.090 --> 01:59:45.360
Orlando Sequera: Are you going to give us any test questions? I'd be mentioning as much as possible. Would you have it in front of you already? With test Prep. I would recommend you to take questions in test prep. And take your time. This it's better to do it as a team, I mean. I'm sorry as an individual

1108
01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:51.520
Orlando Sequera: in regards to not forcing group activities. Do you mean outside activities? Not pretending to a project

1109
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:53.530
Orlando Sequera: mostly. Yes.

1110
02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:12.240
Orlando Sequera: should there? And another question. Should there any be there any limit or training hours for each team member and project live well, do you have to? It depends on the project, right? So

1111
02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:18.450
Orlando Sequera: it depends on the project you're going to need more training in. In some situations you're going to need

1112
02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:23.429
Orlando Sequera: less training for team members. So it's. It depends on the actual project.

1113
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:27.499
Orlando Sequera: all right. So we are going to.

1114
02:00:27.690 --> 02:00:29.479
Orlando Sequera: If they get them in a break.

1115
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:33.780
Orlando Sequera: and when we come back we're going to continue with our content.

1116
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:35.330
Orlando Sequera: and

1117
02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.920
Orlando Sequera: we're going to talk about evaluating project progress. Let me

1118
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:50.929
Orlando Sequera: your entire a. We. We need you to be focused on that on that topic. It is important. So we are going to take a 10 min break. Enjoy, and we'll be back in 10 min.

1119
02:01:24.570 --> 02:01:26.179
You

1120
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:31.360
the

1121
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:33.820
you!

1122
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:36.250
Oh.

1123
02:01:38.970 --> 02:01:40.050
you!

1124
02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.139
He! He!

1125
02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:53.960
You

1126
02:01:54.250 --> 02:01:56.160
the

1127
02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:02.769
you

1128
02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:20.250
Orlando Sequera: all right. Welcome back, everyone

1129
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:21.360
Orlando Sequera: We

1130
02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.839
Orlando Sequera: going to continue with our content.

1131
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:26.580
Orlando Sequera: And

1132
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:28.730
Orlando Sequera: and now we're going to talk about

1133
02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:32.420
Orlando Sequera: evaluating project progress.

1134
02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:47.589
Orlando Sequera: Remember that during planning right we were able to come up with baselines for a project.

1135
02:02:47.650 --> 02:02:48.790
Orlando Sequera: We

1136
02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.019
Orlando Sequera: understood the thresholds that we have.

1137
02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.590
Orlando Sequera: including test and evaluation procedures that were established. And now.

1138
02:02:56.630 --> 02:02:58.309
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1139
02:02:59.490 --> 02:03:02.209
Orlando Sequera: performance, we have to.

1140
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:06.170
Orlando Sequera: We have one main goal, which is to understand

1141
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.620
Orlando Sequera: the variance that exists between our

1142
02:03:11.170 --> 02:03:12.930
Orlando Sequera: actual performance

1143
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:22.679
Orlando Sequera: compared to those plans that we created in the beginning of the project. Okay, this is what we're going to compare actual against plan values.

1144
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:26.160
Orlando Sequera: A quick example, simple to understand.

1145
02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:27.490
Orlando Sequera: We

1146
02:03:27.670 --> 02:03:33.949
Orlando Sequera: let's go back to the example of building our our house a a one-story house right.

1147
02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:40.219
Orlando Sequera: and we laid out in planning. We laid out the schedule and we laid out the budget

1148
02:03:41.290 --> 02:03:52.709
Orlando Sequera: for the house, and we laid out the resources, the quality, the risk approach every single area. Right? That's what we did in planning. Those are our plans. But now we have.

1149
02:03:53.280 --> 02:04:06.050
Orlando Sequera: We're at a point that the work is getting done. We have our a team members working the the construction workers mainly, and engineers and architects and

1150
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:17.679
Orlando Sequera: plumbers and electricians and a roof specialist. They're working all together in building the actual house. Things are happening. It's no longer planning. We are

1151
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:30.960
Orlando Sequera: executing the project. We are a working on the the team is working on the actual project and we are managing the project. Okay, so this is what we're going to compare. Okay, we said that for

1152
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:32.410
Orlando Sequera: to complete

1153
02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.179
Orlando Sequera: the activity of

1154
02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:41.050
Orlando Sequera: completing the entire, a plumbing for the house was gonna take

1155
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:44.790
Orlando Sequera: a 2 months, for example, or

1156
02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:45.910
Orlando Sequera: a month.

1157
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:52.109
Orlando Sequera: That's what we plan for. So now we started working on the project, and then.

1158
02:04:52.160 --> 02:05:00.300
Orlando Sequera: if we wanna check the progress. Okay, right now, it's been if they number 15, it's it's been

1159
02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:03.569
Orlando Sequera: a little bit over 2 weeks. Where are we at

1160
02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:06.969
Orlando Sequera: with our a, with our plumbing

1161
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:20.370
Orlando Sequera: installation activity? So are we right? We were supposed to be. Are we behind schedule, or are we ahead of schedule? Maybe we are ahead of schedule. Maybe we have installed 75%

1162
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:22.409
Orlando Sequera: of the plumbing.

1163
02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:36.909
Orlando Sequera: or maybe we have only been able to install 20. So that's what we do when we compare the the actual performance we're comparing what is actually happening in the project to what we plan for. Okay work, we because

1164
02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:53.690
Orlando Sequera: with the plans in some cases we're gonna be aligned with the plans. But chances are that it's gonna be there's gonna be a variance between what actually happens compared to what we plan for. Okay, that's how we measure performance a

1165
02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:58.820
Orlando Sequera: one key aspect. You can pretty much measure everything but one key aspect.

1166
02:05:58.890 --> 02:06:06.169
Orlando Sequera: A. It's it's very important. Only measure what matters right, and then it's usually these areas of the project scope.

1167
02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:08.339
Orlando Sequera: the percentage of the work completed.

1168
02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:16.000
Orlando Sequera: Right? What is the percentage of the work completed on that? This what you gonna show. By the way, this is what you're gonna show in your project. Status reports.

1169
02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:21.689
Orlando Sequera: Any change requests that are coming that have come in some changes that we have to implement

1170
02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:31.950
Orlando Sequera: again. We're gonna we're gonna we're going to monitor performance against the schedule Ha! In regards to the duration where we at

1171
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:44.409
Orlando Sequera: with in regards to iteration. Are we ahead of scheduled? Are we behind scheduled? Are we right on time with our project activities? What about the cost? Let's go back to those plumbing activities and starting the plumbing for the house.

1172
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:45.760
Orlando Sequera: Are we

1173
02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:49.509
Orlando Sequera: spending what we said that we were going to be spending in planning?

1174
02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:56.049
Orlando Sequera: Are we overspending. Are we under spending? Are we right on Budget right? We have to

1175
02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:01.219
Orlando Sequera: provide that's part of the information that we're going to provide to our

1176
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:09.109
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders in this status report. And then what about the resources? Do we have the team allocation that we need

1177
02:07:09.130 --> 02:07:25.419
Orlando Sequera: it? What about this is where we're going to be monitoring the performance of our vendors. Right? We create a contract. We're working with multiple vendors. This is where we're gonna have. We're gonna be monitoring their performance as well, and also the performance of those contracts that we sign with those vendors.

1178
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:44.589
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna also be paying attention to our number of defects. Our quality super important constraint of any project. The number of defects that we have. That's why we're using a quality approaches, and we briefly mentioned quality mainly with following the quality guidance of quality standards and

1179
02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:50.079
Orlando Sequera: mention quality assurance. We're gonna we're gonna do a deeper dive when it comes to quality and then risk

1180
02:07:50.100 --> 02:08:06.340
Orlando Sequera: What risks have materialized? Have we? What have we done? Have our responses worked as intended to? We have any residual risk or any secondary risk post a response implementation. So that's how we measure and track performance.

1181
02:08:07.190 --> 02:08:13.960
Orlando Sequera: If we are comparing mainly actual what's going on, what's happening in reality? To what?

1182
02:08:14.330 --> 02:08:15.940
Orlando Sequera: M. 4. Okay.

1183
02:08:16.190 --> 02:08:21.249
Orlando Sequera: And we're going to report on that performance. As I mentioned before.

1184
02:08:21.370 --> 02:08:31.229
Orlando Sequera: this is what we're going to to provide to our stakeholders masked on schedule. How well are we tracking against the mountains or significant events of our projects?

1185
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:35.150
Orlando Sequera: We're going to also report on quality the number of defects.

1186
02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:51.510
Orlando Sequera: what we plan for, and then a key technique that is going to help us to understand the health of our scheduled and also the health of our of our project. Budget is earned value management that boils down to that. We have specific metrics.

1187
02:08:51.760 --> 02:09:01.929
Orlando Sequera: Cpi and Spi, mainly, that are going to help us to understand the health of our projects we're going to. We're going to go. We're going to do a deeper dive about it and running management

1188
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:11.090
Orlando Sequera: with the don't be e we're gonna get to that. I promise you that we're gonna get to that. We're gonna be able to analyze variances. And that's also gonna be a report

1189
02:09:11.370 --> 02:09:13.670
Orlando Sequera: work Performance reports

1190
02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:14.710
Orlando Sequera: A.

1191
02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:21.459
Orlando Sequera: As the work gets done we're going to be able to produce broad data like we have completed.

1192
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:27.130
Orlando Sequera: I want to explain quickly what I work. Performance report is, we have completed

1193
02:09:27.190 --> 02:09:29.139
Orlando Sequera: 10, a

1194
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:35.129
Orlando Sequera: 10 walls of the exterior walls of the house, and we have completed 5 windows so far.

1195
02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:37.360
Orlando Sequera: and

1196
02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:42.660
Orlando Sequera: we completed 25 of the landscaping.

1197
02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:47.970
Orlando Sequera: That is broad data that is going to be produced. And we have

1198
02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:49.719
Orlando Sequera: 5 defects

1199
02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:51.279
Orlando Sequera: road data

1200
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.319
Orlando Sequera: That is not really

1201
02:09:54.650 --> 02:10:09.029
Orlando Sequera: well. It's raw data. But you need to add, do you need to transform that raw data into information? And in order to do that, what you have to do is to add context. And that's where

1202
02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.650
Orlando Sequera: you those are. Your actions right? 5 defects 5 windows completed

1203
02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:23.510
Orlando Sequera: 75% of the roof has been completed. Well, those are your access. But what did you plan for? Okay, by now we should have completed

1204
02:10:23.630 --> 02:10:39.420
Orlando Sequera: 10 windows, not 50, okay. So you at context. And when you add context to that broad data. It becomes information. And then that information we put in a reporting format, and that's what we call work performance reports.

1205
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:47.790
Orlando Sequera: The status reports are one type of a word performance report, and for add their projects we use dashboards.

1206
02:10:48.130 --> 02:10:52.989
Orlando Sequera: Member an information radiator that represents the status of the work.

1207
02:10:53.010 --> 02:11:12.699
Orlando Sequera: That is one way to keep track of performance, because we're gonna have our list of items that are in the to do list, the ones that are being work that are being worked on, and they once that have been completed, we can track project progress that way. Okay, you tailor this to your needs, but it's applicable to both

1208
02:11:14.230 --> 02:11:17.120
Orlando Sequera: predictive, adaptive, and hybrid.

1209
02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:25.800
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to the scope. As I have said, this is the most important aspect of any project.

1210
02:11:26.490 --> 02:11:29.519
Orlando Sequera: Everything is built around this cup of your project.

1211
02:11:29.710 --> 02:11:31.249
Orlando Sequera: You have to

1212
02:11:31.770 --> 02:11:43.930
Orlando Sequera: monitor the scope, following a different approach. If you're using a predictive approach, remember that we have baselines. We are going to have an approved version

1213
02:11:43.940 --> 02:12:01.410
Orlando Sequera: in this case of this code that is only going to be changed through the integrated change control process. Okay, and we have the corresponding Wbs with the Associated Wbs Dictionary. So the way we monitor the scope is that we're going to

1214
02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:06.330
Orlando Sequera: compare the completion. What has act our actions against

1215
02:12:06.850 --> 02:12:10.609
Orlando Sequera: the scope, Baseline? That's how we monitor scope in.

1216
02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:13.890
Orlando Sequera: If we're following a predictive approach.

1217
02:12:14.010 --> 02:12:14.969
Orlando Sequera: then

1218
02:12:15.130 --> 02:12:17.479
Orlando Sequera: in agile is a little bit different.

1219
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:23.329
Orlando Sequera: Remember that the scope is not fixed as it is in predictive.

1220
02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:32.019
Orlando Sequera: So this is gonna be evolving. The scope is going to be evolving, for from the nature of the roadmap that you had at the beginning of the project

1221
02:12:32.250 --> 02:12:44.970
Orlando Sequera: it to a the release backlogs and the iteration backlog. So you use a proto backlog that is going to be changing throughout the life cycle of the problem, the project

1222
02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:57.119
Orlando Sequera: and you have to review that every prioritize as needed. Your per backlog is constantly going to be changing, and what you have to do is to make sure that your

1223
02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:10.610
Orlando Sequera: for for the backlog is prioritized at all times. By that I mean that the features that at the most value are always at the top. The individual in charge of that is the product owner, but

1224
02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.190
Orlando Sequera: we have to work with them to make sure that that gets done

1225
02:13:15.570 --> 02:13:16.700
Orlando Sequera: every

1226
02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:24.890
Orlando Sequera: before every iteration starts. Okay, and the way that you do that is to check the user stories and the definition of done

1227
02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:28.810
Orlando Sequera: against the customer feedback and your product requirements.

1228
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.789
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to hybrid it's a combination of the 2

1229
02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.900
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1230
02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.080
Orlando Sequera: an important aspect that has to happen that has to happen here at this point.

1231
02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:43.610
Orlando Sequera: Scope, validation.

1232
02:13:43.730 --> 02:13:49.190
Orlando Sequera: This is something that happens regardless of the approach. We're always going to have to validate

1233
02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.609
Orlando Sequera: what we build in our project

1234
02:13:51.710 --> 02:14:04.099
Orlando Sequera: against what the customer wanted. Hey, we're gonna we are going to do that, regardless of the approach, we always gonna have scope validation. The main difference between

1235
02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:15.549
Orlando Sequera: predictive and agile is that usually scope validation in predictive that happens at the end of the project right? When everything has been built.

1236
02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:17.210
Orlando Sequera: then we have

1237
02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:26.080
Orlando Sequera: everything is done following that big Big Bang approach. Right? We have a scope validation. We're going to review a with our.

1238
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:44.929
Orlando Sequera: we actually actually actually there are 2 steps for that. We do it internally. First, we do scope verification. That's when the team members internally review that all the requirements were met and built and all the functionality, all this code that was agreed upon was

1239
02:14:44.940 --> 02:15:01.880
Orlando Sequera: indeed completed. That is, if we doing it with a team internally. We call that scope verification. And then, if we pass that that process successfully, we move on to scope validation. That is gonna be done with the customer. We're gonna do the same. We're gonna

1240
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:07.090
Orlando Sequera: a show to our customers what we build based on the

1241
02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:15.169
Orlando Sequera: the requirements based on the scope that we were able to define for our project. And this is where that

1242
02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:28.980
Orlando Sequera: artifact that we talked about when we were defining the scope that we mentioned a a couple of days ago, there was the requirements, traceability, matrix. It's actually requirements, traceability, matrix. This is where that

1243
02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:38.030
Orlando Sequera: a requirements traceability, matrix is gonna come handy because we're gonna be able to show. Well missed, Mr. Mrs. Customer, we build the house

1244
02:15:38.050 --> 02:15:57.750
Orlando Sequera: with metal roof, because that was the requirement that we had. These are the sign up on the requirements, and this is the house with concrete walls, exterior walls. We have carpet floors for the rooms, and we have tile for the common areas of the house, and we have

1245
02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:06.919
Orlando Sequera: from porch we have a back porch. We have this pool based on those requirements, and we also have to show the scope statement

1246
02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:25.520
Orlando Sequera: A as well to make. This is how we perform that validation. Everything has to be signed off, and this is where we a showcase to them what we build, and more importantly, get their acceptance. This is an important step before we can close our project. Okay, this might drive changes.

1247
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.269
Orlando Sequera: This might drive changes, but those changes might be

1248
02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:33.769
Orlando Sequera: are going to be evaluated, and if there is an impact

1249
02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:44.089
Orlando Sequera: to the budget we can, we? We have to review that. But the goal is to get acceptance from the customers, and in agile

1250
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:52.129
Orlando Sequera: is very similar. It's very similar. We're going to use acceptance Criteria a: we're going to use.

1251
02:16:52.150 --> 02:17:09.490
Orlando Sequera: which is a specific in in predictive. I forgot to mention that we have acceptance criteria for every single requirement. That's how we do it. But in agile it's a little bit different. We have acceptance criteria for the specific requirement for the use of story in this case.

1252
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:19.410
Orlando Sequera: But we also have another checklist, and that's how you have to to think of the acceptance criteria and the definition of tone. They are checklist that we have to check the boxes.

1253
02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:26.410
Orlando Sequera: And, by the way, the acceptance criteria is the first box that you're going to find in the definition of done.

1254
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:28.980
Orlando Sequera: So you gotta be able to check all the boxes.

1255
02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:38.889
Orlando Sequera: and we do this multiple times. This co validation happens multiple times throughout the agile project, because we do it

1256
02:17:39.090 --> 02:17:55.249
Orlando Sequera: by iteration. Every duration that ends. We're gonna have a scope validation. And this happens in the spring or Iteration Review meeting, where we show case to our we we do a demo, we showcase to our stakeholders what we built.

1257
02:17:55.260 --> 02:18:02.419
Orlando Sequera: and we're trying to get their their acceptance, and we're going to be able to document that sign of.

1258
02:18:02.490 --> 02:18:08.959
Orlando Sequera: So in essence, if you paid close attention, you might be wondering. Wow! At the end of the day.

1259
02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:12.530
Orlando Sequera: Predictive and agile are not that different?

1260
02:18:13.389 --> 02:18:21.750
Orlando Sequera: They're not what changes mostly is the frequency, because in predictive and both in predictive interactive, we do, planning

1261
02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.690
Orlando Sequera: both in predictive and active, we do the development

1262
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:28.719
Orlando Sequera: in both. In predictive interactive, we do, testing

1263
02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:34.620
Orlando Sequera: both in predictive and interactive with those code, verification and scope. Validation at the end

1264
02:18:34.690 --> 02:18:40.210
Orlando Sequera: in both approaches. What changes is the frequency in predict? If we do it.

1265
02:18:40.450 --> 02:18:42.490
Orlando Sequera: the planning face is long.

1266
02:18:42.590 --> 02:18:52.400
Orlando Sequera: then the development phase is wrong. We spent, we take all the time to produce our requirements, and then this conversation happens at the end. After all, the deliberals are built

1267
02:18:52.570 --> 02:18:58.770
Orlando Sequera: for an adaptive in agile. We do it multiple times. We do it every at

1268
02:18:58.799 --> 02:19:18.790
Orlando Sequera: one iteration at a time. We're having multiple planning sessions. We're having multiple development sessions. We're having multiple a scope validation sessions. So. But in essence, what changes is the frequency? Okay? And for hybrid is a combination of these 2. You can do it

1269
02:19:18.799 --> 02:19:28.400
Orlando Sequera: some areas of the scope. You might follow an agile approach some areas of scope. You can follow a predictive approach, and that's what we mean by hybrid.

1270
02:19:29.299 --> 02:19:30.219
Orlando Sequera: A.

1271
02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:38.830
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to this call validation. This is the important aspect we have to make sure that we we have to take into account

1272
02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:40.400
Orlando Sequera: this curve statement.

1273
02:19:40.889 --> 02:19:46.270
Orlando Sequera: and the key aspect in agile is going to be the definition of Don.

1274
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:47.049
Okay.

1275
02:19:48.730 --> 02:19:49.560
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1276
02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:52.669
Orlando Sequera: So that is

1277
02:19:52.770 --> 02:20:02.820
Orlando Sequera: in this case, what is the artifact that determines the acceptance criteria cisco statement? Because this co-statement co covers the description of the scope.

1278
02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:08.899
Orlando Sequera: and then in the adaptive approach is the definition of that. We have to be able to meet the definition of done

1279
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.960
Orlando Sequera: that's

1280
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:13.919
Orlando Sequera: covers the actual acceptance criteria as well.

1281
02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:27.859
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to measuring the scheduled performance. We have multiple methods depending on the approach. We have game charts, so we can review

1282
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:30.699
Orlando Sequera: the performance, tracking over time

1283
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:38.010
Orlando Sequera: for all of them for predictive, agile, and hybrid. We can use earn value management.

1284
02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:40.440
Orlando Sequera: This is where we track custom.

1285
02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:41.770
Orlando Sequera: A and

1286
02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:48.220
Orlando Sequera: and duration scheduled duration performance. We have quality metrics, and we also have variance analysis

1287
02:20:48.310 --> 02:20:56.370
Orlando Sequera: for the 3 of them. And then for agile and hybrid, we can compare the work that has been completed

1288
02:20:56.510 --> 02:21:00.150
Orlando Sequera: per iteration to what we committed

1289
02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:02.109
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of the iteration.

1290
02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:09.919
Orlando Sequera: We review the completed work in the spring, demos at the end of each iteration, and then we can determine

1291
02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:12.160
Orlando Sequera: any

1292
02:21:12.850 --> 02:21:23.129
Orlando Sequera: improvements for subsequent iterations during the retrospective. Okay. And we can conduct schedule reviews to conduct retrospective discoveries

1293
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:25.920
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1294
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:29.120
Orlando Sequera: schedule management tools.

1295
02:21:30.430 --> 02:21:32.229
Orlando Sequera: This is for predictive.

1296
02:21:33.090 --> 02:21:35.010
Orlando Sequera: If we need to

1297
02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:38.670
Orlando Sequera: change course. If we need to act on the schedule.

1298
02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:42.969
Orlando Sequera: there are multiple ways that we can do that. We can

1299
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:47.949
Orlando Sequera: make adjustments to schedule, to to reflect, resource and supply demand.

1300
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:55.809
Orlando Sequera: We can optimize it as well as we cover with resource, moving and resource leveling they

1301
02:21:55.850 --> 02:22:10.470
Orlando Sequera: we get we one we can optimize for scheduled, as we mentioned before, when we talked about scheduled, using resource, moving and resource leveling from the resource perspective resource, moving to make sure that we're not, for example, working

1302
02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:26.320
Orlando Sequera: or resource leveling that we're not making people work 80 h a week. That's how we can complete the schedule if we have people working 80 h a week, including weekends. Right? No, let's level that make sure that we are within 3 determined limits.

1303
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:38.970
Orlando Sequera: It could be 45, 50 h a week, whatever. Your this is just an example, just an example to whatever predetermined limits your organization has in place. So you're making the best use for your resources and then moving.

1304
02:22:39.310 --> 02:22:56.890
Orlando Sequera: Do you? Do you want to make sure that during your scheduled you don't have resources working 75 h a week, or or 50 h a week, and then you have other weeks in which they're working only 5 or 10 h. Do you want to make the best use of your resources. That's one way that you have

1305
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:57.660
Orlando Sequera: 2

1306
02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:05.170
Orlando Sequera: optimized your schedule and the other one is what we cover with scheduled compression techniques.

1307
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:08.919
Orlando Sequera: And here we can use fast tracking, which is

1308
02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:25.380
Orlando Sequera: doing activities or performing activities. And normally we will do it sequentially. We can then do. We're gonna do it in parallel now, at the same time. But of course, taking into account that this can improve this can at risk to our prom to our project

1309
02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:42.839
Orlando Sequera: because it can have an impact on quality, for example, or crashing with J. As we said before, adding additional resources to some to activities that are part of the critical path. So you can then shorten the duration. Because this is these tools are

1310
02:23:42.850 --> 02:23:55.549
Orlando Sequera: the answers to some questions that you might have, you might get a scenario question that might tell you. Okay, you your project a. For example, You have been able to determine that

1311
02:23:56.610 --> 02:23:59.519
Orlando Sequera: a your schedule is 6 months. But

1312
02:23:59.570 --> 02:24:02.520
Orlando Sequera: suddenly one of the stakeholders tells you. Well.

1313
02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:05.110
Orlando Sequera: we do not have 6 months. We have

1314
02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:14.800
Orlando Sequera: 4 months. We need to complete. We have a hard deadline. We have a contract sign, and we need to complete this product in 4 months. What can we do?

1315
02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:29.649
Orlando Sequera: What can you do to solve that situation, and the answer is going to be: You're going to be depending on what it is you're going to be using these tools. They may give you some hints on. You can do it from both perspective, what it's going to be between

1316
02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:46.989
Orlando Sequera: resource, optimization or schedule compression techniques. That's how you solve that problem. That's how you have to approach the exam. That's how they can ask you about these tools. They'll give you a scenario, and then they're gonna ask. They're gonna throw a careful. Okay, You determine that your schedule was

1317
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:55.890
Orlando Sequera: a 8 months. We don't have 8 months. What can we have? 6 months? What can we do? This is the answer, okay, using these tools

1318
02:24:57.520 --> 02:24:58.500
Orlando Sequera: Also.

1319
02:25:00.890 --> 02:25:03.599
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to performance

1320
02:25:03.930 --> 02:25:04.840
Orlando Sequera: A,

1321
02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.839
Orlando Sequera: it's about comparing, as I mentioned before, what has been completed.

1322
02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:29.150
Orlando Sequera: the actuals compared to what we said that we were gonna do. This is also applicable to agile projects. Okay, we do it. It's the same principle. Basically but what we compare, and remember that in agile we do not have percentages of completion in agile is either done or not done.

1323
02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:36.810
Orlando Sequera: We have, in order to say that something has been complete. We have to check every single item in the acceptance criteria.

1324
02:25:37.310 --> 02:25:50.030
Orlando Sequera: and then every single item which is a checklist, every single item in the definition of done. That's how we can say that something as a user story, a requirement has been completed in agile.

1325
02:25:50.040 --> 02:26:00.300
Orlando Sequera: So and, by the way, the acceptance criteria is one of the check boxes that you have in your definition of done, we have to check the acceptance. Criteria has been completed

1326
02:26:00.890 --> 02:26:05.990
Orlando Sequera: the way we visualize the performance in agile or hybrid.

1327
02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:10.200
Orlando Sequera: It's a little bit different. We use dashboards that show us

1328
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.460
Orlando Sequera: a progress in

1329
02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:15.670
Orlando Sequera: in regards to the protocol.

1330
02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:24.140
Orlando Sequera: and we use something that is called Burn down or burn up charts. We're going to go in a little bit more detail into those we display this information

1331
02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:30.539
Orlando Sequera: using information radiators which we keep mentioning. And we're going to watch a video about information radiators.

1332
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:31.590
Orlando Sequera: a

1333
02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:41.010
Orlando Sequera: that are located in specific places. We can have a digital version of it, or we can have a physical version of the information radiator. And then

1334
02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.819
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be using

1335
02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:49.479
Orlando Sequera: cabin boards that are gonna help us to understand the progress of our project over time.

1336
02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:55.949
Orlando Sequera: And now we're going to watch a video that is gonna help us to understand a little bit more about

1337
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:59.119
Orlando Sequera: information radiators.

1338
02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:10.239
90% of all the information transmitted to the brain is visual.

1339
02:27:10.270 --> 02:27:15.710
Not surprisingly. Visuals are processed 60,000 times faster than text.

1340
02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:21.609
We are wired to automatically interpret patterns for instant comprehension with almost 0 effort.

1341
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:23.710
Want to see some examples.

1342
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:25.850
What do you see? Right away?

1343
02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:27.550
A different shape.

1344
02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:29.229
and with this one

1345
02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:31.060
a different size.

1346
02:27:31.850 --> 02:27:33.060
and with this one

1347
02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:34.630
a different color

1348
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:38.650
that brings us to an information radiator.

1349
02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:49.629
An information radiator is a type of visual control that displays project information in a place where passers-by can see it and get information without having to ask questions.

1350
02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:53.830
The Far left column of this example starts with the project Charter.

1351
02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:58.150
This lists the project's primary objectives, key features.

1352
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:59.999
and cautions, and risks.

1353
02:28:00.210 --> 02:28:04.039
It also lists. Those who have key roles in the project's completion

1354
02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:06.919
the product owner, the architecture owners.

1355
02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:08.129
and the team lead.

1356
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:13.290
Finally, it provides a glossary of project terms which may not be widely known.

1357
02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:20.709
The next column of this example indicates any impediments and blockers that are slowing or preventing progress on the project.

1358
02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:27.140
This includes both known and outstanding blockers, and those that have been mitigated or completed.

1359
02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:32.569
The bottom of this column provides a convenient place for the color coding to reside

1360
02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:35.570
in this case. Green for done.

1361
02:28:35.850 --> 02:28:37.240
blue first started

1362
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:38.919
red for blockers

1363
02:28:39.130 --> 02:28:41.230
and yellow for dependencies.

1364
02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:45.610
The large center section of this example shows the product backlog.

1365
02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:48.469
It also shows the iteration backlog.

1366
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:53.269
the specific tasks being worked on by members of the team in the current iteration.

1367
02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:58.340
The far right section of this example shows the iteration burn down

1368
02:28:58.590 --> 02:29:02.330
the rate at which the team is burning through its customer stories.

1369
02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:08.030
This can tell the team whether they are on track ahead or behind the committed work.

1370
02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:10.880
It also shows the release. Burn up

1371
02:29:11.450 --> 02:29:19.859
this monitors progress of release, commitment, iteration by iteration, and gives the team a projection of when they will meet their release goal.

1372
02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:21.230
And finally.

1373
02:29:21.250 --> 02:29:26.280
it shows working agreements. These agreements detail how the team will work together

1374
02:29:26.350 --> 02:29:28.379
and what they can expect of each other.

1375
02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:32.100
Of course this is just an example.

1376
02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:36.860
Your information radiator should be customized to meet the needs of your team.

1377
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:44.829
Orlando Sequera: and this is how, if we're following an agile approach or hybrid, we can

1378
02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:54.229
Orlando Sequera: avoid or minimize the need for project status meetings as much as possible, because all the information is going to be available

1379
02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:59.929
Orlando Sequera: at all times. We are not keeping anything from anybody is in.

1380
02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:06.150
Orlando Sequera: There are multiple ways of doing this. It can be done with low tech manually, or

1381
02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:08.959
Orlando Sequera: thank God that nowadays that we have

1382
02:30:09.010 --> 02:30:10.930
Orlando Sequera: software that can help us

1383
02:30:11.290 --> 02:30:23.780
Orlando Sequera: to create this information. Radiators, for example, Jira from Atlasian is one of them. You can create these ports and you can give access to anybody that needs to have access in a very easy way.

1384
02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.880
Orlando Sequera: There's another tool that i'm familiar with

1385
02:30:27.090 --> 02:30:31.970
Orlando Sequera: it. Team foundation server for Microsoft and Trello.

1386
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:39.949
Orlando Sequera: you can create this as well. Okay, this is what's gonna anybody that would like that would like to know what's going on with the project. You can refer them

1387
02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:41.840
Orlando Sequera: to the information

1388
02:30:41.950 --> 02:30:43.190
Orlando Sequera: radiator

1389
02:30:44.610 --> 02:30:49.489
Orlando Sequera: we keep talking about the and we briefly mentioned the burn, the burn down charts.

1390
02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:52.400
Orlando Sequera: This Basically, tracks

1391
02:30:52.530 --> 02:30:53.520
Orlando Sequera: the work

1392
02:30:53.730 --> 02:30:54.810
Orlando Sequera: they work

1393
02:30:55.040 --> 02:30:57.890
Orlando Sequera: that is going to be completed in the iteration

1394
02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:05.380
Orlando Sequera: agile teams. They use a Brand-on chart to show the progress that is being made towards the work that they committed

1395
02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:15.320
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of the iteration. So we have 2 access here. Basically we have in the vertical access. We have the number of user story points

1396
02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:27.160
Orlando Sequera: that we're estimated by the team. And then in the horizontal axis, we're measuring time, the time periods and over time. So we're gonna you can draw a diagonal line between the no total of

1397
02:31:27.430 --> 02:31:34.540
Orlando Sequera: number of user story points. That's going to be your velocity for the current iteration and 0 on the vertical axis.

1398
02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:44.429
Orlando Sequera: So that is the ideal line. And then, as we're progresses, the number of story points completed each time period are going to be noted, and they're going to be visible

1399
02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:49.240
Orlando Sequera: it to show the progress. Okay, these are your actuals. This is the deal

1400
02:31:49.330 --> 02:31:56.989
Orlando Sequera: line, and these these are the red. The red line is going to show your actual what the team was able to complete.

1401
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:58.350
Okay.

1402
02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:05.030
Orlando Sequera: and that this can change. You might have situations in which a team face higher.

1403
02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:17.639
Orlando Sequera: They were less productive because the number they complex, the level of complexity, was hired multiple factors that come into place. So but this is how we use a burn down chart

1404
02:32:17.730 --> 02:32:21.169
Orlando Sequera: to understand how quickly the team is going through.

1405
02:32:21.250 --> 02:32:22.350
Orlando Sequera: they

1406
02:32:22.410 --> 02:32:25.540
Orlando Sequera: producing.

1407
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:30.160
Orlando Sequera: completing user stories per iteration, and

1408
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:49.249
Orlando Sequera: he and over time we can. Using the Brandon chart over time, we can compare to multiple iterations, and that historical data is going to give us an idea of how many user story points. Can a team complete over time in average right? So it could be 30 points or 40 points.

1409
02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:51.740
Orlando Sequera: So when we make those commitments

1410
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:58.959
Orlando Sequera: later in the project. We don't overcome it so we can use velocity. How quickly are they? They're burning through

1411
02:32:59.010 --> 02:33:01.410
Orlando Sequera: A user story points over time.

1412
02:33:01.470 --> 02:33:09.200
Orlando Sequera: so he's historically has, they have never been able with the same number of people. That is capacity. So we don't overcome it.

1413
02:33:09.450 --> 02:33:29.050
Orlando Sequera: We have the same 3 team members that we have had in the past. We shouldn't be committed to 60 user story points. If our velocity has been 30 or 40. For example, we shouldn't over commit. That's how we can set help the team to set them for success and not

1414
02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.940
Orlando Sequera: for failure. And the burden of chart

1415
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:35.230
Orlando Sequera: is a little bit different. This is.

1416
02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:42.859
Orlando Sequera: we create a baseline for the burn down only after estimating the full value of the release backlog.

1417
02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:56.960
Orlando Sequera: And then what we're trying to measure here is, show the accumulated progress of complete work. It's kind of the opposite with the burn up that is going to show us eventually over time. If we keep

1418
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:59.959
Orlando Sequera: burning through items at this rate.

1419
02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:08.079
Orlando Sequera: How far, how many iterations are we or strings are we going to need in order to complete all the project? Okay, so it's

1420
02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:17.739
Orlando Sequera: A: we usually start slow. So in iteration number one, not many user stories, if any at all. But in iteration number 2

1421
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:31.640
Orlando Sequera: hit 20 user story points. So over time this went up, the team was has been and picking up over time, and the number of user story points is gonna take us based on this, at least 8 iterations to complete.

1422
02:34:32.170 --> 02:34:35.859
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So that is to predict how many

1423
02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:40.949
Orlando Sequera: iterations are we going to need in order to a complete the work.

1424
02:34:41.730 --> 02:34:44.190
Orlando Sequera: This is calculated by the tools.

1425
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:59.529
Orlando Sequera: Okay, you have, Jira. You have trailer. You have version, one. It's another one that I forgot to mention. They can calculate this for you, and they're gonna help you. But remember, they are only gonna be as good as the information that you input, in those

1426
02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:18.889
Orlando Sequera: in in those tools. So garbage in garbage out. Right? Same principle is applicable here, but they're gonna help you and your team as long as they enter whenever they complete their their their user stories and they're entering the information ideally on a daily basis. You're gonna be able to predict

1427
02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:28.190
Orlando Sequera: how many iterations do you need, and how many or what is the velocity of your team? How many, how quickly can they go over completing

1428
02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:29.740
Orlando Sequera: project work?

1429
02:35:31.430 --> 02:35:32.230
Orlando Sequera: A.

1430
02:35:32.370 --> 02:35:34.020
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to

1431
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:41.280
Orlando Sequera: having a share, understanding and evaluating progress. This is this: is actually the the beauty of

1432
02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:45.500
Orlando Sequera: using an information radiator, because this can be.

1433
02:35:45.610 --> 02:35:46.610
Orlando Sequera: This is

1434
02:35:46.690 --> 02:35:56.439
Orlando Sequera: This is very interesting. By the way, this is specific, for as your projects or some hybrid projects, you use task force that show the status of the work. And so

1435
02:35:56.890 --> 02:36:02.459
Orlando Sequera: anybody can understand what are the items that we have in the to do list, and they associated

1436
02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:07.340
Orlando Sequera: user story points in this case. What are we working on right now?

1437
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:15.030
Orlando Sequera: We might have another column besides Don, what are the items that are being tested? And by items I mean user stores. By the way.

1438
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:18.219
Orlando Sequera: what are the items that we tested? What are the items that are being

1439
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:30.920
Orlando Sequera: a block at this particular point? And from there the actual team leader, scrum master can help in getting whatever is needed to remove those blockers.

1440
02:36:30.930 --> 02:36:41.380
Orlando Sequera: and then the list of items that are done. So this is also another way that we can use for agile and hybrid projects to track progress. Okay?

1441
02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:43.380
Orlando Sequera: Oh, these are

1442
02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:46.580
Orlando Sequera: types of information radiators. By the way.

1443
02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:48.720
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1444
02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:52.250
Orlando Sequera: estimating something that I mentioned the velocity.

1445
02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:53.630
Orlando Sequera: Basically.

1446
02:36:53.730 --> 02:37:01.589
Orlando Sequera: it is important to understand. And but it this takes time. I'm gonna put some caveats here. The velocity in simple terms is

1447
02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.370
Orlando Sequera: this is for Nigel team. By the way.

1448
02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:07.939
Orlando Sequera: how quickly are they completing

1449
02:37:08.430 --> 02:37:12.030
Orlando Sequera: user story points over time per iteration.

1450
02:37:12.090 --> 02:37:14.600
Orlando Sequera: So in this case we have

1451
02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:15.879
Orlando Sequera: in this chart

1452
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:21.859
Orlando Sequera: A. For the first iteration. They went over a little bit over a 100 user story points.

1453
02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:27.119
Orlando Sequera: then the second iteration. They didn't hit a 100 points.

1454
02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:32.989
Orlando Sequera: Then the third iteration they went over. Well, over a 100 points, right? So you have.

1455
02:37:33.390 --> 02:37:40.040
Orlando Sequera: My recommendation is for teams that are new to working together. It takes

1456
02:37:40.390 --> 02:37:41.490
Orlando Sequera: at least

1457
02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:48.659
Orlando Sequera: 2 or 3 iterations to get a better feel for their velocity, because this velocity is going to help you

1458
02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:50.350
Orlando Sequera: 2,

1459
02:37:52.160 --> 02:38:05.679
Orlando Sequera: be. It's gonna help. Not just you. It's gonna help the team to make better to make more realistic commitments when in spring planning, they say, okay, Mr. Product owner. We're gonna commit to deliver

1460
02:38:05.730 --> 02:38:07.830
Orlando Sequera: 80 user story points.

1461
02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:19.650
Orlando Sequera: If we have the velocity. If we keep track of the velocity and we see that historically, For example, for this specific example, the team is going to commit to the liver 300 user story points.

1462
02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:22.270
Orlando Sequera: If we look at the velocity chart

1463
02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:29.949
Orlando Sequera: with the same people, by the way, with the same number of team members, which is what we call capacity. If we do that.

1464
02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:32.259
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be setting the team up

1465
02:38:32.370 --> 02:38:49.030
Orlando Sequera: forces for failure, because if we look at velocity with the same 3 members, we have never been able to hit a 300 users toward points. So therefore we shouldn't be coming into deliver 300 users story points. Our velocity, historically, is 90.

1466
02:38:49.480 --> 02:39:07.580
Orlando Sequera: 90 user story points, 90.5, almost but 90 points, 90 user story points per iteration. So we shouldn't commit to deliver more than 90 with the same capacity. Okay, this is also another way that helps teams to

1467
02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:15.630
Orlando Sequera: set themselves for success, and it's a way that we can another technique that we can use to track progress.

1468
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:17.190
Okay.

1469
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:21.289
Orlando Sequera: we also have other ways to measure

1470
02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:34.009
Orlando Sequera: a progress as well. This is more for flow. If we're following more of a a lean approach, we can compare the work in progress that hasn't been completed.

1471
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:51.509
Orlando Sequera: A. And this is where the lead time, the the duration of the time work. Item, goes through the entire process compared to the cycle time, and then the throughput. So this is specifically for lean approaches. That's what we mean by continuous flow.

1472
02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:59.859
Orlando Sequera: And that's basically one way that we have to track progress. If we are following a continuous flow or lean approach.

1473
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:10.460
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect that we have to take into account when it comes to money. Turning performance is budget challenges. This happens all the time.

1474
02:40:11.580 --> 02:40:14.170
Orlando Sequera: If we have new requirements.

1475
02:40:14.930 --> 02:40:17.289
Orlando Sequera: That usually means that

1476
02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:18.830
Orlando Sequera: there's going to be an impact

1477
02:40:18.860 --> 02:40:28.039
Orlando Sequera: on your budget. You're gonna need more money to complete those requirements. Not necessarily everything in every single situation. But in most cases you're gonna need

1478
02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:29.900
Orlando Sequera: more money and more time.

1479
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:42.989
Orlando Sequera: This also has an impact on your risks that might be some risk associated with that. And then this might bring changes to cost estimates. Okay. So that happens all the time

1480
02:40:43.090 --> 02:40:44.310
Orlando Sequera: for that.

1481
02:40:44.650 --> 02:40:46.720
Orlando Sequera: That's where we use

1482
02:40:47.350 --> 02:40:50.300
Orlando Sequera: this metrics that can help us to

1483
02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:57.809
Orlando Sequera: a measure, project, progress, and address any of those changes, and also

1484
02:40:58.350 --> 02:41:06.640
Orlando Sequera: make any corrections that we have to make to our performance. Okay, and value management.

1485
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:08.469
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Remind you, Mansion.

1486
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:14.929
Orlando Sequera: these are metrics that we use to understand that are going to allow us to compare our

1487
02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:20.360
Orlando Sequera: for our performance, our actuals against what we plan for.

1488
02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:27.190
Orlando Sequera: Okay, they're going to help us to evaluate the health of our schedule, and also of our budget.

1489
02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:29.670
Orlando Sequera: and they're going to help us to

1490
02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:43.599
Orlando Sequera: if we're going down the route, the the wrong path. We have a major delays with our budget measures, or major major delays with our scheduled with our budget, a major cost overruns.

1491
02:41:43.930 --> 02:41:50.530
Orlando Sequera: By using and ready management we're going to prevent that from happening, because we're going to have ways to predict

1492
02:41:50.620 --> 02:42:03.729
Orlando Sequera: the future it behavior. If we continue to go down this path we're going to end up with major cost. Overrun some major delays. By using our 5 min from going to, we can prevent that accident from happening.

1493
02:42:03.850 --> 02:42:04.920
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1494
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:07.620
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to value management.

1495
02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:13.320
Orlando Sequera: we have to take into account mainly

1496
02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:16.650
Orlando Sequera: a 3 important variables.

1497
02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:18.919
Orlando Sequera: First, one is

1498
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:20.589
Orlando Sequera: the plan value

1499
02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:24.040
Orlando Sequera: what we call the plan value. This is

1500
02:42:24.580 --> 02:42:26.310
Orlando Sequera: what we plan.

1501
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:37.560
Orlando Sequera: The work that we plan and we have is the authorized budget assigned to projects to schedule work. This is what we plan for when we build those activities in our

1502
02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:46.040
Orlando Sequera: project schedule, for example, this the and those were authorized because we went through. We have a scheduled baseline. This is the

1503
02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:53.750
Orlando Sequera: actual authorized scheduled work that we have. This is what we plan for. Okay, then, we have the earned value

1504
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:56.070
Orlando Sequera: and value is

1505
02:42:57.470 --> 02:42:59.000
Orlando Sequera: how much work

1506
02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:07.430
Orlando Sequera: the amount of work that you have been able to complete at any point in time in your project. Express

1507
02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:10.060
Orlando Sequera: in money terms. Okay.

1508
02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:13.699
Orlando Sequera: So for example, and i'm gonna use a quick example, and then

1509
02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:24.630
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna talk about the actual cost. That's very simple. To understand is, how much money have you spent at a particular point in time. So plan value. Let's assume that your

1510
02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.150
Orlando Sequera: your project consists of building 10 houses, not just 1 10 houses. Okay.

1511
02:43:30.180 --> 02:43:31.469
Orlando Sequera: and you have.

1512
02:43:31.730 --> 02:43:34.659
Orlando Sequera: That is your project got to be 10 houses in

1513
02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:37.850
Orlando Sequera: a in

1514
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:39.690
Orlando Sequera: one year.

1515
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:42.249
Orlando Sequera: That is your project schedule. One year

1516
02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:44.890
Orlando Sequera: you have to build 10 houses

1517
02:43:45.350 --> 02:43:46.410
Orlando Sequera: by

1518
02:43:46.430 --> 02:43:52.859
Orlando Sequera: month. Number 6. How many houses should you have completed to be on time?

1519
02:43:54.010 --> 02:43:55.509
Orlando Sequera: And I'm going to open up the

1520
02:43:55.540 --> 02:43:56.310
Orlando Sequera: chat!

1521
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:57.890
Orlando Sequera: The

1522
02:43:58.160 --> 02:43:59.069
Orlando Sequera: for that!

1523
02:44:05.330 --> 02:44:07.150
Orlando Sequera: How many houses have you

1524
02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:10.559
Orlando Sequera: should you have completed 5 houses, right?

1525
02:44:10.810 --> 02:44:12.039
Orlando Sequera: 5 houses?

1526
02:44:12.990 --> 02:44:19.819
Orlando Sequera: That is the plan. Yeah, correct. So I see that most of you are on the right side. So that is your plan. Value

1527
02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:21.530
Orlando Sequera: should be

1528
02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:25.289
Orlando Sequera: by 50%.

1529
02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:31.560
Orlando Sequera: But the ear value, maybe that is your actual. That is what actually happened. Perhaps

1530
02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:33.890
Orlando Sequera: perhaps your

1531
02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.270
Orlando Sequera: you have been able to complete

1532
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:38.090
Orlando Sequera: 3 houses

1533
02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:41.529
Orlando Sequera: or 2 or 6 could be

1534
02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:43.479
Orlando Sequera: could be more than what you plan for.

1535
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:47.600
Orlando Sequera: Okay, 6 for that's your actual. So they?

1536
02:44:47.630 --> 02:44:50.200
Orlando Sequera: How much work were you able to complete

1537
02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:57.359
Orlando Sequera: they 3 houses, for example? And oh, I forgot to tell you, let's assume that our budget is a 1 million dollars, or

1538
02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:08.660
Orlando Sequera: for the sake of a of the example. Right? So your schedule one year, your budget for the project a 1 million dollars and your project is to build 10 houses, so

1539
02:45:09.290 --> 02:45:13.890
Orlando Sequera: your own value in that situation. Let's assume that you were able to complete only

1540
02:45:16.810 --> 02:45:18.719
Orlando Sequera: 3 houses, so

1541
02:45:18.970 --> 02:45:22.769
Orlando Sequera: our budget is a 1 million dollars. What will be the

1542
02:45:23.190 --> 02:45:28.130
Orlando Sequera: actual earned value? How can I express? Let's say that we completed only

1543
02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:31.690
Orlando Sequera: we only completed 3 houses in 5 months.

1544
02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:36.430
Orlando Sequera: What is that express in dollars?

1545
02:45:36.490 --> 02:45:39.560
Orlando Sequera: It's assumed that we're using us dollars for for this exercise.

1546
02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:42.809
Orlando Sequera: $300,000. Correct.

1547
02:45:43.350 --> 02:45:45.870
Orlando Sequera: Correct. That is your own value.

1548
02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.180
Orlando Sequera: And what is your plan? Value express in us dollars now that we know that the budget is

1549
02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:57.789
Orlando Sequera: a what is the what is the plan? Value in dollars plan value $500,000.

1550
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:00.010
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1551
02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:03.409
Orlando Sequera: I see that most of you are getting it. But i'm going to clarify.

1552
02:46:03.530 --> 02:46:05.990
Orlando Sequera: How are we calculating that because

1553
02:46:06.270 --> 02:46:09.249
Orlando Sequera: our budget is to a budget is a 1 million dollars.

1554
02:46:09.890 --> 02:46:10.940
Orlando Sequera: Our

1555
02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:13.020
Orlando Sequera: a

1556
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:16.230
Orlando Sequera: plan value is at 6 months

1557
02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:18.289
Orlando Sequera: we should have completed

1558
02:46:19.410 --> 02:46:24.240
Orlando Sequera: 5 houses right half of it 50. But if you divide a 1 million dollars

1559
02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:39.180
Orlando Sequera: between, and this is very linear, by the way, just for the sake of purposes, the the the the example. If you divide the 1 million dollars between 1010 houses that you have to complete is a $100 a $100,000 each house, so we only completed 3.

1560
02:46:39.230 --> 02:46:40.220
Orlando Sequera: Then

1561
02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:41.350
Orlando Sequera: your

1562
02:46:41.470 --> 02:46:47.810
Orlando Sequera: houses are you? You have Your own value is $300,000, but your plan value is

1563
02:46:48.010 --> 02:46:50.929
Orlando Sequera: $500,000, because you should have completed

1564
02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.019
Orlando Sequera: 5 homes.

1565
02:46:53.180 --> 02:47:13.140
Orlando Sequera: That is the easy way to understand plan value. That's what we plan for expressing dollars and value. That's the work that we have been able to complete express in money terms not just dollars in money terms, right? It could be any currency. And then actual cost is, how much money have you spent at a particular

1566
02:47:13.150 --> 02:47:26.240
Orlando Sequera: pointing time in your project? That's the simple and easy way to understand, plan, value, earn value, and actual cost. How much money you have to spend. That is actual cost. When it comes to earning value.

1567
02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.149
Orlando Sequera: We have to understand the goal with our values. To understand is our project

1568
02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:38.089
Orlando Sequera: progressing on schedule? Are we

1569
02:47:38.610 --> 02:47:44.320
Orlando Sequera: ahead of schedule behind schedule, or are we under? Are we right

1570
02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:49.609
Orlando Sequera: on schedule, or are we behind scheduled? So 3 scenarios is either ahead of schedule

1571
02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:51.050
Orlando Sequera: ideally.

1572
02:47:51.220 --> 02:47:53.370
Orlando Sequera: at least on schedule

1573
02:47:53.590 --> 02:48:12.160
Orlando Sequera: or behind schedule. So let's use the same values that the same values that we use. For our example, let's assume for a minute, and the first way that we measure our project performance when it comes to schedule is with a variance what we call scheduled variance. Okay, so

1574
02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:13.649
Orlando Sequera: let's assume that

1575
02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:23.020
Orlando Sequera: same concept, right? Same example. We have a 1 million dollars for a budget. We have one year to complete 10 houses

1576
02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:29.029
Orlando Sequera: month Number 6. At the end of month, month, number 6. We said that our

1577
02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.519
Orlando Sequera: we we we should have been able to complete at least

1578
02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:37.439
Orlando Sequera: 5 houses, but we were able to determine that

1579
02:48:37.690 --> 02:48:42.260
Orlando Sequera: we were not able to do that. We completed only

1580
02:48:42.330 --> 02:48:44.340
Orlando Sequera: rehouses. So

1581
02:48:44.470 --> 02:48:47.590
Orlando Sequera: what will be the scheduled variance in that

1582
02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:49.420
Orlando Sequera: in that situation.

1583
02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:53.040
Orlando Sequera: and i'm going to open up

1584
02:48:54.250 --> 02:48:55.140
Orlando Sequera: the chat

1585
02:48:59.830 --> 02:49:05.739
Orlando Sequera: so it will be. What is our? It will be negative, so that the earned value is

1586
02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:10.669
Orlando Sequera: 300,000 minus 500,000 is negative.

1587
02:49:14.730 --> 02:49:18.470
Orlando Sequera: 200,000. So we have a negative scheduled variance.

1588
02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:22.989
Orlando Sequera: That means is that good or bad? I'm gonna ask you. That question is that good or bad?

1589
02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:29.210
Orlando Sequera: That's bad, and that means what? When we have a negative variance, what does it mean?

1590
02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:33.009
Orlando Sequera: The project is behind schedule.

1591
02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:35.550
Orlando Sequera: But what if we completed

1592
02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:39.499
Orlando Sequera: our earned value? We were able to complete

1593
02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:41.340
Orlando Sequera: 6 houses.

1594
02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:44.750
Orlando Sequera: What is our own value? If we complete the 6 houses

1595
02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:48.329
Orlando Sequera: that will be

1596
02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:50.539
Orlando Sequera: 600,000 right?

1597
02:49:51.090 --> 02:49:53.440
Orlando Sequera: And then what will be your scheduled variance?

1598
02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:57.390
Orlando Sequera: A 100,000 positive

1599
02:49:58.450 --> 02:50:01.189
Orlando Sequera: positive means that, are we

1600
02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:06.429
Orlando Sequera: a hip or behind schedule? We have a positive variance. We are ahead of schedule. That's good.

1601
02:50:06.730 --> 02:50:12.970
Orlando Sequera: And what if our earned value? At the end of 5 month of 6 months we completed 5 houses.

1602
02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:14.789
Orlando Sequera: so our earned value.

1603
02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:15.740
Orlando Sequera: if

1604
02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:26.299
Orlando Sequera: 500,000 we don't have any variance. What does it mean? We are right on time. Okay, I want you to understand this the easiest way possible. That's what it is.

1605
02:50:26.740 --> 02:50:29.869
Orlando Sequera: Exactly. That's so. You guys are correct.

1606
02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:31.530
Orlando Sequera: but

1607
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:36.150
Orlando Sequera: one thing is that we have to come up with a way, or

1608
02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:45.910
Orlando Sequera: experts. Not not not us. Experts have to come up with a way that was apples to apples to every single project, because in many cases projects had

1609
02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:53.770
Orlando Sequera: projects are going to have different durations. They're going to have different budgets, so we needed to have to have an approach that was

1610
02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:59.399
Orlando Sequera: going to be the same for every single project, regardless of the amount, because $500,000

1611
02:50:59.510 --> 02:51:00.440
Orlando Sequera: variance

1612
02:51:00.610 --> 02:51:10.810
Orlando Sequera: in. If the budget is 200 milliondollars. Maybe it's not going to be the same impact as is if the budget is going to be a a 1 million dollars, right? So

1613
02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:19.100
Orlando Sequera: in order to do that we had to come up with a standardized approach that can help us to understand apples to apples.

1614
02:51:19.390 --> 02:51:36.739
Orlando Sequera: and a metric that was applied to every single project, regardless of the amount, so we could understand specifically how the projects were performing. And that's where the scheduled performance index came up to play. We have. We can divide

1615
02:51:36.830 --> 02:51:38.369
Orlando Sequera: the earned value

1616
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:41.110
Orlando Sequera: by the plan value.

1617
02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:47.580
Orlando Sequera: and we're gonna get we're gonna get a specific amount. So if we are.

1618
02:51:48.210 --> 02:51:52.349
Orlando Sequera: if we divide, let's assume that our own value we were only able to complete

1619
02:51:52.530 --> 02:51:53.800
Orlando Sequera: 3 houses.

1620
02:51:53.980 --> 02:52:03.819
Orlando Sequera: and that is going to be $300,000 for the same example that we're using, and our prime value is $500,000. So what is the FBI?

1621
02:52:04.330 --> 02:52:05.590
Orlando Sequera: You divide

1622
02:52:05.660 --> 02:52:09.310
Orlando Sequera: a number at 300,000, divided by 500,000,

1623
02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:11.329
Orlando Sequera: and i'm going to open up the chat.

1624
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:17.639
Orlando Sequera: And I'm going to tell you without doing any calculation. It's going to be 0 Point something

1625
02:52:18.690 --> 02:52:22.879
Orlando Sequera: because your numerator is lower than your denominator

1626
02:52:23.010 --> 02:52:24.610
Orlando Sequera: is 0 point 6.

1627
02:52:24.660 --> 02:52:32.160
Orlando Sequera: That means that's bad for your project. That's bad for your project. That means that your project is behind scheduled. If it's less.

1628
02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:34.239
Orlando Sequera: then one is back.

1629
02:52:34.880 --> 02:52:42.869
Orlando Sequera: If behind scheduled. Your project is behind schedule. Okay, less than one is bad. The price we hand schedule. But what if you complete it?

1630
02:52:44.000 --> 02:53:00.919
Orlando Sequera: 6 houses Your earned value was is 600,000 divided by 500,000. What it's gonna be more than one. I'm gonna tell you right away. 1.2, some. Would you calculate that's good. That means that your project is ahead of scheduled. So this is how we do it with

1631
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:02.910
Orlando Sequera: a

1632
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:09.540
Orlando Sequera: with actual a with project status reports. This is how we do it. We use the metric.

1633
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:11.820
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we use the metric.

1634
02:53:12.260 --> 02:53:13.199
Orlando Sequera: and

1635
02:53:13.290 --> 02:53:16.849
Orlando Sequera: the same goes for the cost. This is for the schedule.

1636
02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:22.799
Orlando Sequera: Put the same goals for the cost, but it's a little bit different. We take into account instead of plan value.

1637
02:53:23.010 --> 02:53:33.169
Orlando Sequera: In order to calculate the cost variance we take into account. How much money have we may have we been able to spend, which is the actual cost easy to understand.

1638
02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:39.499
Orlando Sequera: but is the same principle. If it's cost variance. You take into account your own value how much

1639
02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:41.660
Orlando Sequera: work express in

1640
02:53:42.210 --> 02:53:50.660
Orlando Sequera: the particular currency I tend to save dollars. But it's not only dollars a minus your actual cost, the amount of money that you have

1641
02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:51.490
Orlando Sequera: 2,

1642
02:53:52.370 --> 02:53:59.210
Orlando Sequera: that you have that you have spent so far so, and the same principle. If your earned value

1643
02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:07.919
Orlando Sequera: cool equals your actual cost, the money that you have spent no variance. That means that your project is on budget. But if your

1644
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:24.630
Orlando Sequera: and value is lower than your actual cost, how much money you have to spend, let's assume that in this go back to the same principle. The same example that we use our own value is $300,000. We have spent $700,000. So far, what is our cost? Variance?

1645
02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:31.230
Orlando Sequera: $300,000. It's our own value, and we have spent

1646
02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:40.809
Orlando Sequera: $700,000, minus $400,000. It's gonna be our cost. Fairness, negative negative, 400,000. That is, that good or bad?

1647
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:45.260
Orlando Sequera: That's bad right? That means that we are.

1648
02:54:48.730 --> 02:54:54.700
Orlando Sequera: No, we're not behind. We are over budget. We are over budget. We are over. Budget.

1649
02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:55.699
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1650
02:54:55.980 --> 02:54:57.499
Orlando Sequera: pay attention to that.

1651
02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:06.509
Orlando Sequera: And what about If our and value is $500,000, and we have spent so far only $200,000.

1652
02:55:07.890 --> 02:55:09.220
Orlando Sequera: Is that good or bad?

1653
02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:11.410
Orlando Sequera: That's good, right?

1654
02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:15.590
Orlando Sequera: And yes hour. It will be $300,000 Positive

1655
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:20.190
Orlando Sequera: we are under budget. That's good. Okay. So again.

1656
02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:32.309
Orlando Sequera: But we had to use the same approach that we had to follow that with the follow before for every single project that it was applicable to every single project. I'm gonna post the chat again.

1657
02:55:35.380 --> 02:55:43.230
Orlando Sequera: We have to use that approach that will work for every single project. So Cpi is going to be your own value, divided by your actual cost.

1658
02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:47.030
Orlando Sequera: And if you're

1659
02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:56.180
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna open up the chat again If your earned value is $300,000, and your actual cost is 500,000. What is your Cpi

1660
02:55:56.370 --> 02:56:00.259
Orlando Sequera: without doing the calculation and it I know that it's going to be 0 point. Something

1661
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.660
Orlando Sequera: okay.

1662
02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:05.520
Orlando Sequera: Is that good or bad?

1663
02:56:07.630 --> 02:56:08.369
Orlando Sequera: What's that

1664
02:56:09.850 --> 02:56:11.289
Orlando Sequera: for your project? Your

1665
02:56:11.380 --> 02:56:12.480
Orlando Sequera: over budget

1666
02:56:13.310 --> 02:56:21.369
Orlando Sequera: you're spending more than what you're supposed to. So again the same principle. But what if your earned value is 600,000, and your actual cost is

1667
02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:23.589
Orlando Sequera: 500,000.

1668
02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:26.439
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to venture to say that it's going to be 1 point something

1669
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:30.410
Orlando Sequera: 1.2 is that good or bad?

1670
02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:34.550
Orlando Sequera: That's good. That means that you are

1671
02:56:34.610 --> 02:56:35.949
Orlando Sequera: under budget.

1672
02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:40.180
Orlando Sequera: Okay. But what if your in value and your actual costs are the same?

1673
02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:41.910
Orlando Sequera: What's going to be your Cpi?

1674
02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:53.260
Orlando Sequera: No, it's gonna be one same number divided by the same number. It's gonna be one. That means that you are right on budget. Okay, that is the easiest way to understand

1675
02:56:53.550 --> 02:56:54.949
Orlando Sequera: and value management.

1676
02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:56.949
Orlando Sequera: but we also have.

1677
02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:00.670
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna post the chat.

1678
02:57:03.330 --> 02:57:08.129
Orlando Sequera: We also have to make some determination. Those are indicators to understand the health our

1679
02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:14.529
Orlando Sequera: performance when it comes to budget, and we also have to understand a

1680
02:57:14.570 --> 02:57:20.189
Orlando Sequera: our help when it comes to our budget and our schedule. But with their value management. We get a little bit more.

1681
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:25.410
Orlando Sequera: We can predict what's what's gonna happen in the future.

1682
02:57:25.620 --> 02:57:29.979
Orlando Sequera: We can predict if we continue down this path.

1683
02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:38.489
Orlando Sequera: what's gonna happen in the future. So we can do a prediction. That's where the estimated completion formula comes into play.

1684
02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:40.990
Orlando Sequera: and they are based on

1685
02:57:41.620 --> 02:57:50.360
Orlando Sequera: the Cpi. Do need to calculate the Cpi first, the current spending efficiency, how efficient we're being with our with the way we're spending our money

1686
02:57:50.370 --> 02:58:06.100
Orlando Sequera: and our budget at completion. By the way, Bud did, a completion equals your overall project budget. Don't: let that confuse your B I. C. Equals your project. Budget. Okay, so estimate a completion is a prediction. If we continue down this path

1687
02:58:06.170 --> 02:58:09.059
Orlando Sequera: we are going to end up somewhere. Okay.

1688
02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:16.039
Orlando Sequera: we are gonna end up somewhere, and we depending on the Cpi based on the Cpi. So the formula will be.

1689
02:58:16.140 --> 02:58:27.880
Orlando Sequera: You're gonna divide your overall project budget completion, divided by your Cpi, whatever it is, so your budget at completion. Let's assume that it's a 1 million dollars divided by

1690
02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:31.850
Orlando Sequera: a let's assume that you are.

1691
02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:36.199
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna open up the chat divided by 0 point 6

1692
02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:43.609
Orlando Sequera: without doing any calculation. I'm gonna tell you that it's gonna be more eac. It's gonna be more than a 1 million dollars.

1693
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:45.769
Orlando Sequera: I'm told you that right away.

1694
02:58:47.730 --> 02:58:52.329
Orlando Sequera: So you divide a 1 million dollars divided by one by 0 Point 6.

1695
02:58:54.610 --> 02:58:58.339
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be more than a 1 million dollar. It's going to be over a 1 million dollars.

1696
02:58:59.170 --> 02:59:12.110
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so you that means that if you continue down that path you're gonna your project is gonna end up, costing you more. That exactly 1.7 million dollars exactly. If you continue down this path

1697
02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:25.639
Orlando Sequera: we have, we're gonna end up spending not a 1 million dollars. When i'm understanding a 1 million point 7. And let me tell you that's a that's a lot of explanation that you have to give to your stakeholders. If that's a situation, so we better fix

1698
02:59:25.680 --> 02:59:29.840
Orlando Sequera: the way we're spending money in our project. We were to fix our Cpi

1699
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:33.340
Orlando Sequera: A, and then we also can predict

1700
02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:46.729
Orlando Sequera: the cost required to complete the remainder of the project. That's where we use the estimate to complete. But i'm gonna make you calculate another. Another example for the eac before we go to, etc. If

1701
02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:56.559
Orlando Sequera: If our Cpi is 1.2 divide, 1 million divided by 1.2, what is the result? Without the calculation? I can tell you that it's less than a 1 million dollars.

1702
02:59:57.290 --> 02:59:58.739
Orlando Sequera: It's 900 and something

1703
03:00:00.500 --> 03:00:02.850
Orlando Sequera: $833,000.

1704
03:00:02.930 --> 03:00:04.620
Orlando Sequera: If that is the case

1705
03:00:05.860 --> 03:00:09.940
Orlando Sequera: you, if you continue down this path you're going to end up

1706
03:00:10.730 --> 03:00:15.830
Orlando Sequera: on their budget. You're going to spend 188, 830,000dollars.

1707
03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:25.460
Orlando Sequera: That's gonna be music to the ears of your stakeholders. Okay, so you can predict the future estimate. A completion is a forecast

1708
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:29.949
Orlando Sequera: of the future based on the current spending efficiency.

1709
03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:30.789
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1710
03:00:30.870 --> 03:00:37.159
Orlando Sequera: and the estimate to complete is going to help you to understand, based on your

1711
03:00:37.190 --> 03:00:55.740
Orlando Sequera: now that you calculated your eac where you're going to end up, based on your current spending efficiency with your Cpi, You're gonna be able to determine how much one do you have? Do you need to complete the remainder of the project. It's going to be your eac, your forecasted budget minus your actual cost.

1712
03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:56.880
Okay.

1713
03:00:57.560 --> 03:01:01.949
Orlando Sequera: I have to explain this the simplest way possible. I'm. Going to post the chat.

1714
03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:03.929
Orlando Sequera: and for

1715
03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:25.189
Orlando Sequera: and value management we also use it in agile projects as well. We also it's an agile project. It. We can help to understand, based on the items that we plan that we said that we committed to complete compare to what we completed, or or the rate of completion with our.

1716
03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:26.740
Orlando Sequera: with our actual

1717
03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:28.770
Orlando Sequera: a velocity.

1718
03:01:28.930 --> 03:01:29.740
Orlando Sequera: it

1719
03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:35.389
Orlando Sequera: following and value management. We can understand how many rations our plan, how many

1720
03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:52.149
Orlando Sequera: user story points we have to we? And then based on the release budget that we have available. So we can use the same principle whether we're going with an agile approach, or whether we're going with a predictive approach and value is applicable to any of your

1721
03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:55.659
Orlando Sequera: a, any of your actual.

1722
03:01:55.950 --> 03:01:57.280
Orlando Sequera: any of the

1723
03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:01.520
Orlando Sequera: life cycles that you can. The approaches that you can use

1724
03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:08.820
Orlando Sequera: agile and value methods. A couple of things agile and value methods are

1725
03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:11.260
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more complex.

1726
03:02:11.290 --> 03:02:16.839
Orlando Sequera: and they're going beyond the scope of the exam. The exam is not really about

1727
03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:24.799
Orlando Sequera: trying to determine whether you're an agile expert. You need to know enough agile to be dangerous, and we're covering that above and beyond. But

1728
03:02:25.250 --> 03:02:33.540
Orlando Sequera: the you can apply. The goal here is that you can also apply and value management to add your projects for you to know that. Okay.

1729
03:02:38.310 --> 03:02:42.359
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to managing and leaving resources, we have to include

1730
03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:44.660
Orlando Sequera: all the resources that we have

1731
03:02:44.890 --> 03:02:50.939
Orlando Sequera: theme and external contractors. We have to pay attention to risks. We have to check our contracts.

1732
03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:55.959
Orlando Sequera: and we have to a. As our contracts are completed. This is also about

1733
03:02:56.170 --> 03:03:05.810
Orlando Sequera: performance right? We have to check any deliberals that have been completed. We have to make sure that the payments are being made accordingly, as

1734
03:03:06.430 --> 03:03:20.310
Orlando Sequera: per the contract whenever any deliver will have been completed and based on the terms of the contract we have to make the payments when we come back from break. I'm going to review the questions, and we'll address any

1735
03:03:20.980 --> 03:03:34.550
Orlando Sequera: questions related to to earn value management, and I know that some of you Might we wondering, do I need to memorize all the formulas. I'm going to be getting formula questions in the exam. We're going to talk about that when we come back from break.

1736
03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:35.410
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1737
03:03:35.550 --> 03:03:46.959
Orlando Sequera: So, but this is important about the performance. We also have to take pay attention to other areas. It's not just Cove schedule and budget in our project we have to monitor procurement. We have to monitor those contracts. Okay.

1738
03:03:48.130 --> 03:03:49.790
Orlando Sequera: and our resources.

1739
03:03:51.130 --> 03:03:52.969
Orlando Sequera: We also have to

1740
03:03:53.240 --> 03:04:01.990
Orlando Sequera: and controller resources. What we are using is not just the people it's about equipment material supplies. Make sure that

1741
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:07.639
Orlando Sequera: whenever you need resources available, they are available. That's why you do this coordination with

1742
03:04:08.230 --> 03:04:27.600
Orlando Sequera: functional managers, or whomever those team members report to to make sure that they are available when you need them. That's part of your planning. And here you're monitoring to make sure that your resources are indeed available when you need them. Otherwise your schedule is gonna be affected.

1743
03:04:27.610 --> 03:04:28.410
Orlando Sequera: Your

1744
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:29.880
Orlando Sequera: a.

1745
03:04:30.270 --> 03:04:34.360
Orlando Sequera: Your budget might be effective at at Sarah. So you're monitoring here that

1746
03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:38.060
Orlando Sequera: what you plan for is actually happening in the

1747
03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:40.119
Orlando Sequera: you also have to

1748
03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:41.330
Orlando Sequera: focus on

1749
03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:48.270
Orlando Sequera: updating it. Your resource allocation. You get a keeping track of what has been used today

1750
03:04:48.740 --> 03:04:52.110
Orlando Sequera: what is still needed and review

1751
03:04:52.400 --> 03:05:01.279
Orlando Sequera: constantly they month. Do you have to monitor your your expenditures that is important to track your to monitor and control your budget.

1752
03:05:01.370 --> 03:05:14.769
Orlando Sequera: If if you're dealing with resource shortages, how can what are the strategies that you have in place, and you can even identify this as a risk and your risk register and address it. Okay, if you know that resource availability is

1753
03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:17.210
Orlando Sequera: a particular risk in your organization.

1754
03:05:17.470 --> 03:05:24.929
Orlando Sequera: but you gotta make sure that your resources are used accordingly, and they are released whenever they completed their project activities.

1755
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:35.760
Orlando Sequera: Inform stakeholders of issues with with relevant resources that goes that coordination with other functional managers, many changes whenever they occur.

1756
03:05:36.360 --> 03:05:38.399
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect

1757
03:05:38.470 --> 03:05:39.360
Orlando Sequera: that

1758
03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:42.260
Orlando Sequera: you have to keep into account. If

1759
03:05:43.390 --> 03:05:45.789
Orlando Sequera: you have to monitor those contracts.

1760
03:05:45.870 --> 03:05:49.949
Orlando Sequera: A any you might also have dispute.

1761
03:05:50.220 --> 03:05:57.889
Orlando Sequera: There is when it comes to when it comes to handling disputes. I want to mention something about in closing, but

1762
03:05:58.640 --> 03:06:08.199
Orlando Sequera: have to be. You have to monitor performance, and all disputes have to be addressed a as possible. Okay, so we are

1763
03:06:08.380 --> 03:06:10.039
Orlando Sequera: going to.

1764
03:06:10.310 --> 03:06:16.549
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna be addressing that when we have to pretty close to. But every single procurement has to be close in your project

1765
03:06:18.170 --> 03:06:19.310
Orlando Sequera: also.

1766
03:06:20.760 --> 03:06:23.919
Orlando Sequera: Well, that's what we have for the first breaks.

1767
03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:31.920
Orlando Sequera: So they are. There are a few questions we are. We have a few minutes before the break. I'm going to address

1768
03:06:32.250 --> 03:06:33.580
Orlando Sequera: a

1769
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:38.169
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to address some of the questions.

1770
03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:49.760
Orlando Sequera: Let's go back to a slide. 61, I see.

1771
03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:11.779
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So I think there are multiple questions here on

1772
03:07:12.060 --> 03:07:15.490
Orlando Sequera: a the chart. So one thing that I wanted to point out

1773
03:07:15.880 --> 03:07:16.789
Orlando Sequera: is

1774
03:07:16.930 --> 03:07:18.329
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to cost

1775
03:07:18.620 --> 03:07:19.890
Orlando Sequera: cost variance.

1776
03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:22.690
Orlando Sequera: Your.

1777
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:25.639
Orlando Sequera: if it's more than one is good.

1778
03:07:26.580 --> 03:07:39.999
Orlando Sequera: So this is positive. This is not over budget there, this is there's a mistake in this light. We're gonna we're gonna work in in in addressing that, but more than one is positive. Some of you cut up on that.

1779
03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:50.079
Orlando Sequera: A more than one is good for your project, as we were able to determine anything. Any Cpi that is more than one means that you are under budget.

1780
03:07:50.270 --> 03:07:54.380
Orlando Sequera: Okay, it's the opposite Here this is inverse, and then.

1781
03:07:55.200 --> 03:08:12.900
Orlando Sequera: if it's less than one, if the product is going to be over. But it is bad if it's 0 point, 6 or 0 point 8. That's but for your project you're overstanding. So this is inverted here. We'll make that correction, my apologies, but those of you that cut up on that are correct.

1782
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:20.510
Orlando Sequera: Any cpi or spi. That is more than one means. If it's Cpi, it means that you are

1783
03:08:20.540 --> 03:08:40.399
Orlando Sequera: under budget. Okay, it's good for your project. You're spending less money than you're supposed to be spending. Let's assume that, for example, your a Cpi is 1.0 7 for your project. That means that for every dollar or every euro that you're spending on your project. You are getting

1784
03:08:40.690 --> 03:08:44.640
Orlando Sequera: a dollar and 7 cents, or a Eur and 7 cents

1785
03:08:44.900 --> 03:08:52.409
Orlando Sequera: in return. That means that that's music to the ears of any stakeholders. So it is. This is inverted. So

1786
03:08:53.170 --> 03:09:02.290
Orlando Sequera: your is your project is below budget. It's on their budget is great if it's more than one is positive if it's less than one.

1787
03:09:02.320 --> 03:09:14.569
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume that a 0 point 8, 6, that is, that for your project that means that for every dollar that you're spending, you are getting 86 cents in return that's bad for your project.

1788
03:09:14.690 --> 03:09:31.459
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so my apologies. That was there was an oversight on that slide for those of you that cut up on that a. I wanted to make the clarification. But going back to the example, you guys got it correct, so more than one is good, less than one is bad for both

1789
03:09:31.470 --> 03:09:36.210
Orlando Sequera: Spi and Cpi. We're going to take a break. Now

1790
03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:40.950
Orlando Sequera: we're ready for our break, and when we come back i'll start by addressing

1791
03:09:41.630 --> 03:09:45.049
Orlando Sequera: some of the questions that I see in the Q. And a. But I wanted to

1792
03:09:45.090 --> 03:09:54.169
Orlando Sequera: a wrap up the first session by correcting that mistake. Okay, Cpi: More than one Spi: More than one is good.

1793
03:09:54.190 --> 03:09:59.960
Orlando Sequera: Cpi a an Spi less than one is bad for your project.

1794
03:10:00.930 --> 03:10:01.729
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1795
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:04.710
Orlando Sequera: so we're gonna take a

1796
03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:10.600
Orlando Sequera: 1 h break. We're going to be back in an hour. Please make sure that you stay logged in

1797
03:10:10.730 --> 03:10:11.960
Orlando Sequera: a

1798
03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:15.950
Orlando Sequera: during the hour break and we're going to.

1799
03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:18.929
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be playing some important videos.

1800
03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:24.660
Orlando Sequera: And when we come back we're gonna continue with the class, so enjoy your break. We'll be back in an hour from now.

1801
03:10:26.380 --> 03:10:27.900
Orlando Sequera: Thank you very much. Everyone.

1802
03:10:36.020 --> 03:10:36.680
Orlando Sequera: Hmm.

1803
03:10:39.350 --> 03:10:41.409
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with our class.

1804
03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:44.899
Orlando Sequera: But before we jump into the next stop

1805
03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:47.590
Orlando Sequera: I would like to go over.

1806
03:10:50.820 --> 03:10:54.999
Orlando Sequera: Let's find one more time just to clarify where we are

1807
03:10:55.480 --> 03:10:58.099
Orlando Sequera: with earn value management, and the way

1808
03:11:00.970 --> 03:11:04.620
Orlando Sequera: the way I'm going to do it is one more time with

1809
03:11:04.690 --> 03:11:06.279
Orlando Sequera: make simple.

1810
03:11:06.700 --> 03:11:10.760
Orlando Sequera: So i'm going to give you some information. We're going to use the same example

1811
03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:12.499
Orlando Sequera: that we use before.

1812
03:11:12.770 --> 03:11:16.620
Orlando Sequera: So I'm. Going to give you the background information for our project.

1813
03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:19.110
Orlando Sequera: Our

1814
03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:26.970
Orlando Sequera: project is consists of building 10 houses 10 single one-story houses

1815
03:11:27.250 --> 03:11:31.890
Orlando Sequera: we have determined. Our schedule is one year to complete

1816
03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:33.390
Orlando Sequera: the 10 houses

1817
03:11:33.540 --> 03:11:40.989
Orlando Sequera: and we also have a budget. That is, a 1 million dollars for our project. We determine this in our

1818
03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:45.630
Orlando Sequera: planning efforts. Okay, how do we do that with all the processes

1819
03:11:45.810 --> 03:11:49.029
Orlando Sequera: and the tools and techniques that we cover in the class

1820
03:11:49.230 --> 03:11:50.459
earlier.

1821
03:11:51.080 --> 03:11:56.899
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we were able to determine that to complete this same houses we need a 1 million dollars and it's gonna take us

1822
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:59.490
Orlando Sequera: a year. Okay. So

1823
03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:03.129
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to let me go back, one more slide

1824
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:10.210
Orlando Sequera: to.

1825
03:12:10.580 --> 03:12:12.100
Orlando Sequera: So this one.

1826
03:12:15.350 --> 03:12:17.240
Orlando Sequera: my apologies

1827
03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:21.050
Orlando Sequera: next one.

1828
03:12:21.550 --> 03:12:22.889
Orlando Sequera: Okay, here we are.

1829
03:12:23.170 --> 03:12:24.340
Orlando Sequera: Plan value.

1830
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:32.189
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we have 3 important components here. We have our plan value. We have our own value, and we have our actual cost.

1831
03:12:32.380 --> 03:12:34.009
Orlando Sequera: So the plan value

1832
03:12:34.330 --> 03:12:35.699
Orlando Sequera: to understand it

1833
03:12:35.830 --> 03:12:38.390
Orlando Sequera: it in a very simple way

1834
03:12:38.470 --> 03:12:43.259
Orlando Sequera: at is what we based on our planning. Where should we be

1835
03:12:43.290 --> 03:12:46.159
Orlando Sequera: at any given point in time in our project.

1836
03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:58.589
Orlando Sequera: expressing that in monetary value, in dollars or euros, or whatever currency we're using for a project right so where should we be At At the end

1837
03:12:58.710 --> 03:13:01.259
Orlando Sequera: of month Number 6.

1838
03:13:01.530 --> 03:13:03.350
Orlando Sequera: In regards to our project.

1839
03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:05.520
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna open up the chat.

1840
03:13:08.250 --> 03:13:15.450
Orlando Sequera: How many houses should we should we build By the end of a month. Number 6, 5 houses, right? 50%

1841
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:19.039
Orlando Sequera: expressing us dollars or euros.

1842
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:20.289
Orlando Sequera: That will be

1843
03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:26.259
Orlando Sequera: $500,000. And why is that? Well, we have

1844
03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:33.079
Orlando Sequera: a 1 million dollars, divided by 10 is a $100,000 per home right very straight for very linear.

1845
03:13:33.250 --> 03:13:38.879
Orlando Sequera: I saw a question in the Q. And a. Before we left. Oh, but wait a second. What about contingencies?

1846
03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:49.700
Orlando Sequera: Remember? We already took that into account when we built this schedule? I'm gonna post the chat for a second. We already build that into this they they bought it. I'm sorry.

1847
03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:54.460
Orlando Sequera: actually in the schedule, too. We already took care of that. We it took care of that.

1848
03:13:54.650 --> 03:13:55.820
Orlando Sequera: This is

1849
03:13:56.000 --> 03:14:10.820
Orlando Sequera: real life. This is happening right now. What's happening in the project? Okay. So we plan that ideally by the end of month Number 6, we should be completed with 50 of the project. Why is that? Because it's a year.

1850
03:14:10.830 --> 03:14:20.070
Orlando Sequera: and we have 10 houses to build ideally. Is that going to be the case in reality? No, not necessarily. Maybe maybe not.

1851
03:14:20.270 --> 03:14:23.519
Orlando Sequera: So. That's where the ear value comes into play.

1852
03:14:23.770 --> 03:14:24.660
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1853
03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:36.539
Orlando Sequera: is the amount of work that has been completed, expressed in monetary terms. So let's assume that after at the end of month, number 6, we completed

1854
03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:37.920
Orlando Sequera: 4 houses.

1855
03:14:38.010 --> 03:14:44.939
Orlando Sequera: What is the earned value. I'm. Going to open up the chat again. What is the earned value? If we completed poor houses.

1856
03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:54.060
Orlando Sequera: the chat is $400,000 correct.

1857
03:14:55.400 --> 03:14:59.390
Orlando Sequera: and then the third element is the actual cost

1858
03:14:59.600 --> 03:15:04.140
Orlando Sequera: is basically, how much money have we spent at a particular

1859
03:15:04.220 --> 03:15:10.069
Orlando Sequera: pointing time in our project? That's all it is, how much only have we spent that is the actual cost?

1860
03:15:10.450 --> 03:15:16.560
Orlando Sequera: A. At a particular at any particular point in time in our project. That's what actual cost is so. Now

1861
03:15:18.610 --> 03:15:19.739
Orlando Sequera: one more time

1862
03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:26.870
Orlando Sequera: we have to track measure. We use and value management to track measure. Let's start

1863
03:15:26.910 --> 03:15:33.220
Orlando Sequera: to track, to measure performance, to track for your performance. Let's start with the scheduled right?

1864
03:15:34.780 --> 03:15:36.960
Orlando Sequera: Is the project for residents schedule.

1865
03:15:37.250 --> 03:15:41.440
Orlando Sequera: For this we can answer this question calculating a variance.

1866
03:15:42.020 --> 03:15:46.059
Orlando Sequera: So we use a scheduled variance. What is called a scheduled variance

1867
03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:49.869
Orlando Sequera: is the formula is your own value

1868
03:15:49.920 --> 03:15:52.759
Orlando Sequera: minus your plan value.

1869
03:15:53.000 --> 03:16:00.289
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that is, the formula is to earn value in our example is $400,000 minus.

1870
03:16:00.580 --> 03:16:02.009
Orlando Sequera: They plan value.

1871
03:16:02.530 --> 03:16:05.399
Orlando Sequera: What is the plan? Value 500,000 right?

1872
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:07.660
Orlando Sequera: What is the scheduled variance?

1873
03:16:09.270 --> 03:16:10.660
Orlando Sequera: Feel free to use a chat

1874
03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:18.150
Orlando Sequera: minus a $100,000 is negative. It's not positive. It's negative because it is

1875
03:16:18.570 --> 03:16:24.920
Orlando Sequera: $400,000, minus 500,000. The the scheduled variance is negative.

1876
03:16:24.980 --> 03:16:27.220
Orlando Sequera: It's minus 100,000.

1877
03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:29.920
Orlando Sequera: Is our project

1878
03:16:29.970 --> 03:16:31.310
Orlando Sequera: based on that

1879
03:16:31.630 --> 03:16:32.849
Orlando Sequera: piece? Our project

1880
03:16:33.070 --> 03:16:41.850
Orlando Sequera: is that good or bad for the project. Let me ask you first that, good or bad for the pro. We have a negative variance. That's bad, a negative variance. It's always bad. Remember that.

1881
03:16:42.070 --> 03:16:43.320
Orlando Sequera: And also

1882
03:16:44.270 --> 03:16:48.740
Orlando Sequera: does that mean that our project is behind schedule or ahead of schedule?

1883
03:16:50.310 --> 03:16:53.240
Orlando Sequera: It means that it's behind schedule. Okay.

1884
03:16:53.300 --> 03:16:54.270
Orlando Sequera: What if

1885
03:16:54.720 --> 03:16:57.589
Orlando Sequera: what what won't happen? If for

1886
03:16:57.810 --> 03:17:01.769
Orlando Sequera: Aaron Valley was $500,000, what is the variance?

1887
03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:07.170
Orlando Sequera: 0? No variance? That means that we are

1888
03:17:07.220 --> 03:17:12.200
Orlando Sequera: right on time. So at the end of month. Number 6. We completed 5 houses.

1889
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:16.960
Orlando Sequera: What we plan for is what actually happened. Okay, we are right on time.

1890
03:17:17.160 --> 03:17:18.669
Orlando Sequera: But what if

1891
03:17:18.730 --> 03:17:23.990
Orlando Sequera: we completed 7 houses in 6 months. What is their in value?

1892
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:31.639
Orlando Sequera: What is the earn value? If we completed 7 houses.

1893
03:17:32.200 --> 03:17:34.059
Orlando Sequera: $700,000,

1894
03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.429
Orlando Sequera: what will be the scheduled variance.

1895
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:41.069
Orlando Sequera: It will be

1896
03:17:41.350 --> 03:17:49.759
Orlando Sequera: plus or positive 200,000 correct. That's a positive variance. What does it mean? He said. It's a positive variance, good or bad, for the project.

1897
03:17:51.880 --> 03:17:56.899
Orlando Sequera: It's good. It means that we are ahead of schedule. Okay, perfect.

1898
03:17:57.080 --> 03:17:58.000
Orlando Sequera: Now.

1899
03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:00.940
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna post the chat for a second.

1900
03:18:04.580 --> 03:18:10.470
Orlando Sequera: since every project is different, and we need a standardized approach.

1901
03:18:10.730 --> 03:18:25.860
Orlando Sequera: For as or I'm. Also for stakeholders. Because remember when opera manager and they're looking at projects. It's not just your project your progress one of many projects that the organization is currently undertaking. So they needed a standardized approach

1902
03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:29.869
Orlando Sequera: that will mean the same to the project, regardless of

1903
03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:41.790
Orlando Sequera: they budget, and regardless of the duration, because a 1 million dollars might not be it, it's going to be different if your if your project is 20 billiondollars, right?

1904
03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:51.200
Orlando Sequera: So a. Compared to where your B whether your budget is 2 million dollars. So they needed a standardized approach. And that's where the scheduled performance

1905
03:18:51.260 --> 03:19:09.790
Orlando Sequera: index. The FBI came into play because is applicable to any project, and it's going to mean it's going to be apples to apples in every single situation. It's a it's an index that measures efficiency in this case of the schedule. So the way we calculate the Spi very simple. Instead of

1906
03:19:10.030 --> 03:19:24.350
Orlando Sequera: calculating the variance. What we're going to do is instead of subtracting the plan value from the earned value we're going to divide it. So we we have our own value. We're going to divide it by our plan value. That's how we're going to calculate this.

1907
03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:27.040
Orlando Sequera: Get your performance index. So

1908
03:19:27.090 --> 03:19:29.730
Orlando Sequera: if our own value is

1909
03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:36.310
Orlando Sequera: $300,000, and our plan value is $500,000. I'm gonna open up the chat again.

1910
03:19:38.260 --> 03:19:39.190
Orlando Sequera: What

1911
03:19:39.320 --> 03:19:44.370
Orlando Sequera: is that? Good or bad for the product? And without doing any calculation. When I say that is 0 point, something.

1912
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:47.219
Orlando Sequera: What's the spi?

1913
03:19:48.080 --> 03:19:50.080
Orlando Sequera: 300,000 divided by

1914
03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:52.360
Orlando Sequera: 500,000 point 6.

1915
03:19:52.820 --> 03:19:57.089
Orlando Sequera: That's back for your project. That means that you are behind schedule.

1916
03:19:57.740 --> 03:19:59.710
Orlando Sequera: That's back for your project. Okay?

1917
03:20:01.170 --> 03:20:03.210
Orlando Sequera: A: what? If your

1918
03:20:03.780 --> 03:20:06.620
Orlando Sequera: and value is 700,000,

1919
03:20:07.080 --> 03:20:14.740
Orlando Sequera: and your plan. Value is 500,000. We come that that's what we plan for. With the with the conditions of our project we were able to finish 7 houses.

1920
03:20:18.620 --> 03:20:23.539
Orlando Sequera: That's 1.4. That's more. That's good, right? So we are ahead of schedule.

1921
03:20:23.560 --> 03:20:26.060
Orlando Sequera: 1.4. So that's

1922
03:20:26.220 --> 03:20:32.449
Orlando Sequera: that means that we are ahead of schedule. So always more than one is good

1923
03:20:33.010 --> 03:20:38.440
Orlando Sequera: means that you are ahead of schedule. When it comes to the Spi, less than one is bad.

1924
03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:42.350
Orlando Sequera: It means that you're behind schedule. And what if our

1925
03:20:42.650 --> 03:20:49.090
Orlando Sequera: erm value is 500,000, or plan values? 500,000? What's gonna be our Sbi?

1926
03:20:52.080 --> 03:20:55.009
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be one right same number divided by the same number.

1927
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:59.570
Orlando Sequera: It'll be one. That means that we are right on schedule. Okay.

1928
03:21:00.220 --> 03:21:01.119
Orlando Sequera: Now.

1929
03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:03.139
Orlando Sequera: i'm going to post the chat

1930
03:21:03.940 --> 03:21:06.319
Orlando Sequera: for a second. And now we're going to move on to

1931
03:21:07.700 --> 03:21:08.570
Orlando Sequera: cost

1932
03:21:09.060 --> 03:21:09.960
Orlando Sequera: cost.

1933
03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:18.489
Orlando Sequera: And here's where we encountered the editorial mistake. My apologies for that. But we do the same with cost. We're going to calculate the variance.

1934
03:21:18.620 --> 03:21:21.190
Orlando Sequera: But in this case we're going to replace

1935
03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:30.750
Orlando Sequera: instead of plan value, we're going to use actual cost, and that's basically the aggregation of all the costs incur until that particular time in the project.

1936
03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:49.820
Orlando Sequera: How much money have we spent in the project? There's no mystery, no mystery, just a how much money you have to spend the social information given to you that's there's there's no mystery when it comes to actual cost. Okay, to calculate the difference is your earned value. Let's assume that your earned value is

1937
03:21:50.490 --> 03:21:54.110
Orlando Sequera: $400,000, and your actual cost is

1938
03:21:54.190 --> 03:21:58.869
Orlando Sequera: $700,000. What is your cost? Variance? I'm. Going to open up the chat again.

1939
03:22:01.210 --> 03:22:02.430
Orlando Sequera: and value

1940
03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:03.440
Orlando Sequera: is

1941
03:22:04.770 --> 03:22:06.150
Orlando Sequera: 400,000.

1942
03:22:06.490 --> 03:22:07.449
Orlando Sequera: Your

1943
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:15.870
Orlando Sequera: actual cost is 700,000. It's gonna be minus 300,000. Right? Is that good or bad? That's bad. That means that we are.

1944
03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:24.639
Orlando Sequera: We are over Budget. We are over spending. Okay, that's bad.

1945
03:22:24.900 --> 03:22:29.600
Orlando Sequera: We are over Budget. We are spending. That's back. Okay, this

1946
03:22:29.620 --> 03:22:45.580
Orlando Sequera: we're. This is inverted. We have to address it. But I wanna make sure a negative variance is bad. It means that we are over spending. That's what it means. Okay, please make sure that you have that you have that clear, Understand? Understanding of that, this is inverted. They should be

1947
03:22:45.610 --> 03:22:49.379
Orlando Sequera: flip, and we're gonna fix it. My apologies for that. But

1948
03:22:49.470 --> 03:22:50.699
Orlando Sequera: negative variance

1949
03:22:50.730 --> 03:22:53.410
Orlando Sequera: is bad. It means that we are overspending.

1950
03:22:54.340 --> 03:22:56.500
Orlando Sequera: What if our own value is

1951
03:22:56.590 --> 03:23:00.780
Orlando Sequera: $700,000, and our actual cost is

1952
03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:03.919
Orlando Sequera: $300,000? What is the cost variance.

1953
03:23:08.260 --> 03:23:14.949
Orlando Sequera: It'll be 400,000 positive right? So that's a positive variance. Is that good or bad for your project.

1954
03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:21.410
Orlando Sequera: and that means that you are on their budget.

1955
03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:23.280
Orlando Sequera: Exactly.

1956
03:23:23.540 --> 03:23:24.770
Orlando Sequera: So that's good.

1957
03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:27.779
Orlando Sequera: And then we also have

1958
03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:31.680
Orlando Sequera: another metric that can help us to understand

1959
03:23:32.740 --> 03:23:34.619
Orlando Sequera: the health of our

1960
03:23:35.050 --> 03:23:36.760
Orlando Sequera: budget in this.

1961
03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:39.330
Orlando Sequera: In this case I'm. Going to post a chat.

1962
03:23:39.500 --> 03:23:46.189
Orlando Sequera: It is the Cpi because we needed to have an approach that worked for every single project.

1963
03:23:46.220 --> 03:23:47.720
Orlando Sequera: Okay to that.

1964
03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:55.930
Orlando Sequera: What's that post to apples to every single project. So we calculate the Cpi again divide in the earned value by the actual cost.

1965
03:23:56.170 --> 03:23:56.980
Orlando Sequera: So

1966
03:23:57.010 --> 03:23:58.380
Orlando Sequera: if our

1967
03:23:58.470 --> 03:24:00.679
Orlando Sequera: and value, when I open up the chat again.

1968
03:24:00.730 --> 03:24:03.289
Orlando Sequera: if our own value is

1969
03:24:04.170 --> 03:24:06.039
Orlando Sequera: $400,000,

1970
03:24:06.140 --> 03:24:08.410
Orlando Sequera: and our actual cost is

1971
03:24:08.430 --> 03:24:11.319
Orlando Sequera: $600,000, what is our Cpi.

1972
03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:23.320
Orlando Sequera: and i'm going to say that a Sierra point something without doing any calculation. I see that some of you are a 0 point 6, 7. It's less than one.

1973
03:24:23.390 --> 03:24:25.600
Orlando Sequera: Is that good or bad for your project?

1974
03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:42.870
Orlando Sequera: That's bad. That means that for every dollar that you're spending on your doll on your project we're get. You're getting 66 cents in return. That's bad. That means that you are over Budget. So this has to be flipped. What we see in the slide has to be flipped.

1975
03:24:43.460 --> 03:24:47.140
Orlando Sequera: Your project is over. Project. That's bad. But what if

1976
03:24:47.820 --> 03:24:48.800
Orlando Sequera: your

1977
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:52.470
Orlando Sequera: what would be the Cpi if your

1978
03:24:53.530 --> 03:24:55.199
Orlando Sequera: and value is

1979
03:24:55.330 --> 03:25:00.899
Orlando Sequera: $600,000, and your actual cost is $400,000.

1980
03:25:01.230 --> 03:25:04.710
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to without doing any calculations. It's going to be 1 point something

1981
03:25:05.300 --> 03:25:07.170
Orlando Sequera: i'll tell you right away.

1982
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:12.799
Orlando Sequera: I see some of you are saying that it's 1.5. Just gonna perform a calculation.

1983
03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:14.460
Orlando Sequera: So is that good or bad?

1984
03:25:16.030 --> 03:25:17.529
Orlando Sequera: That's good for your project.

1985
03:25:19.250 --> 03:25:21.239
Orlando Sequera: That means that you, for

1986
03:25:21.440 --> 03:25:27.580
Orlando Sequera: if it's more than one, it's good for you is that you are under budget. It's under budget. Okay.

1987
03:25:27.660 --> 03:25:35.829
Orlando Sequera: So that's good for your and what if our end value is 500,000, and we have spent so far $500,000 in the project.

1988
03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:43.690
Orlando Sequera: Cpi is one means that we are right on Budget.

1989
03:25:43.780 --> 03:25:49.670
Orlando Sequera: Okay, Just wanted to make sure that we had that we were clear on that. I'm gonna post a chat

1990
03:25:50.100 --> 03:25:51.050
Orlando Sequera: again.

1991
03:25:53.250 --> 03:26:00.719
Orlando Sequera: and then that is to understand what's happening right now. What's happening with our project. But we also can forecast

1992
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:04.780
Orlando Sequera: we can predict the future if we continue down that path.

1993
03:26:04.860 --> 03:26:11.680
Orlando Sequera: and this is where the estimate of completion help us, is going to help us to understand.

1994
03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:17.160
Orlando Sequera: If we continue down this path. This is what's going to happen. This is where we're going to end up.

1995
03:26:17.240 --> 03:26:18.140
Orlando Sequera: So

1996
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:26.329
Orlando Sequera: for estimate of completion or the forecasted budget where we're gonna end up at. If we continue down this path

1997
03:26:26.430 --> 03:26:27.630
Orlando Sequera: we have.

1998
03:26:28.270 --> 03:26:42.010
Orlando Sequera: we meet the budget at completion. That is the overall project budget. We already have that information. Let's take it from our example is a 1 million dollars. We already have that information. Okay? And then the Cpi.

1999
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:43.069
Orlando Sequera: We're going.

2000
03:26:43.150 --> 03:26:50.509
Orlando Sequera: We we have to calculate it, and we're gonna we? We have it already. Let's assume that our Cpi is 0 point 8, 5

2001
03:26:50.740 --> 03:26:55.780
Orlando Sequera: in our budget. That completion is 1 million dollars. What is

2002
03:26:56.120 --> 03:26:57.960
Orlando Sequera: the the estimate

2003
03:26:58.150 --> 03:26:59.380
Orlando Sequera: at completion.

2004
03:27:00.170 --> 03:27:04.610
Orlando Sequera: and I'm going to tell you without doing any calculation. It's going to be more than a 1 million dollars

2005
03:27:06.060 --> 03:27:09.320
Orlando Sequera: 1 million dollars. Cpi 0 point 8, 5.

2006
03:27:10.190 --> 03:27:12.329
Orlando Sequera: I see that some of your experience one

2007
03:27:14.090 --> 03:27:19.689
Orlando Sequera: 1 million 17,000dollars, so your $117,000

2008
03:27:19.740 --> 03:27:20.570
Orlando Sequera: over.

2009
03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:21.699
Orlando Sequera: So

2010
03:27:21.860 --> 03:27:24.210
Orlando Sequera: if you don't address

2011
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:26.480
Orlando Sequera: your current spending

2012
03:27:26.770 --> 03:27:28.859
Orlando Sequera: in your project. You're gonna end up

2013
03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:36.970
Orlando Sequera: way over a 1 million dollars. But what if your Cpi is 1 0, 1.0 7

2014
03:27:37.110 --> 03:27:41.589
Orlando Sequera: same bac a 1 million dollars, and your Cpi is 1.0 7.

2015
03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:43.940
Orlando Sequera: What's going to be your eac

2016
03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:48.179
Orlando Sequera: and i'm going to tell you right away. It's going to be less than a 1 million dollars.

2017
03:27:51.180 --> 03:28:01.689
Orlando Sequera: My $134,000. Okay, some of you are calculating so that's music to the years of any stakeholder that's why this metrics are so important.

2018
03:28:01.720 --> 03:28:08.270
Orlando Sequera: Okay, metrics are so important because we need to keep track of the health of our project. And then

2019
03:28:08.310 --> 03:28:10.490
Orlando Sequera: we can also predict

2020
03:28:11.530 --> 03:28:13.050
Orlando Sequera: how much money

2021
03:28:13.690 --> 03:28:20.660
Orlando Sequera: it's needed to complete the remainder of the project. That is where we use the estimate to complete.

2022
03:28:20.730 --> 03:28:31.780
Orlando Sequera: and the formula is your once you calculate your estimate of completion or your forecasted budget. By the way, this is going to be more realistic than your

2023
03:28:31.790 --> 03:28:46.980
Orlando Sequera: bac, because this is taken into account their current rate of spending your eac. It's more realistic. It's more accurate, not realistic, more accurate than your bac, your bac. You did it with planning efforts, what you knew at the moment. But

2024
03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:56.960
Orlando Sequera: Eac is reality. It's what's happening in your project. Taking into account your current rate of spending. Okay, so.

2025
03:28:57.030 --> 03:28:59.369
Orlando Sequera: in order to understand how much it's gonna cost.

2026
03:29:00.420 --> 03:29:03.440
Orlando Sequera: how much money you need to complete the rest of the project.

2027
03:29:03.580 --> 03:29:19.869
Orlando Sequera: That's where you're gonna be using your etc. And your, etc. Is simply your forecasted budget, your eac, your estimate of completion minus the money that you have already spent in your project, which is your actual cost.

2028
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:23.530
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so just wanted to make sure that we were

2029
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:25.380
Orlando Sequera: clear on

2030
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:28.059
Orlando Sequera: and value management.

2031
03:29:28.330 --> 03:29:38.349
Orlando Sequera: By the way, you can still use our value management for other. It's not just for predictive. This approach that we just cover is mainly for predictive.

2032
03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:48.480
Orlando Sequera: That's what a that's to provide the the the context for the exam, but earn value. Management is also applied to adjunct projects.

2033
03:29:49.360 --> 03:29:54.659
Orlando Sequera: Excuse me, but you we don't need to to go that deeper into that.

2034
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:56.369
Orlando Sequera: The Pmp. Exam

2035
03:29:56.960 --> 03:30:06.809
Orlando Sequera: doesn't go that far when it comes doesn't expect you to know in detail how everybody management is applicable to to add your projects. But I can tell you that

2036
03:30:06.860 --> 03:30:21.989
Orlando Sequera: they it takes into account. You compare the number of user story points completed to what you plan for at the beginning of the iteration, and you keep that in mind. So you use it. You compare actuals to plan values, same principle.

2037
03:30:22.040 --> 03:30:22.730
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2038
03:30:23.210 --> 03:30:25.519
Orlando Sequera: So i'm going to.

2039
03:30:26.160 --> 03:30:29.979
Orlando Sequera: I wanted to make sure that we were on the same page when it comes to

2040
03:30:33.020 --> 03:30:40.749
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to and value management. I'm gonna check. I'm gonna review the Q a. For any questions.

2041
03:30:44.780 --> 03:30:50.590
Orlando Sequera: It's once, like 52 burn charge, and your 16 is bad, because it's close to velocity. Well, not necessarily

2042
03:30:50.640 --> 03:30:55.319
Orlando Sequera: because of that, it's just a historical record. That's what the velocity is.

2043
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:10.599
Orlando Sequera: Is there any information, garner from the intersection of the earned value? Chart from different lines? It just to illustrate that it's going to fluctuate throughout your project. That was the whole point

2044
03:31:10.770 --> 03:31:11.990
Orlando Sequera: of that slide.

2045
03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:28.750
Orlando Sequera: There's another question and value manager. And what does it say? If Budget is a 1 million dollars. You complete 3 houses midway through the project, but the cost was

2046
03:31:28.760 --> 03:31:41.240
Orlando Sequera: 500,000. That is your actual cost. But you need to cut. You're missing the earned value and value the 3 houses that you completed. How can you express that in monetary terms

2047
03:31:41.740 --> 03:31:44.270
Orlando Sequera: based on the example that will be

2048
03:31:44.910 --> 03:31:46.130
Orlando Sequera: that will equal

2049
03:31:46.230 --> 03:31:52.810
Orlando Sequera: $300,000, because if it's a 1 million dollars, 10 houses each one is worth a 100,000.

2050
03:32:00.880 --> 03:32:02.629
Orlando Sequera: Okay, another question

2051
03:32:03.150 --> 03:32:18.229
Orlando Sequera: and value measure slide. What if the learning curve is also need to be into account? No, this is very linear. This is very linear you already took that into account in planning, and you're already addressing that. However, however.

2052
03:32:18.520 --> 03:32:19.699
Orlando Sequera: you

2053
03:32:20.780 --> 03:32:28.180
Orlando Sequera: when you calculate the earn value management, let's assume that you determine. Well, we were able to complete only 4 houses.

2054
03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:31.619
Orlando Sequera: and we plan for 5.

2055
03:32:32.220 --> 03:32:34.969
Orlando Sequera: There. There might be a. V.

2056
03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:43.490
Orlando Sequera: The explanation for that, do you? And value is just showing you where you are environmentally just showing you where you are, hey? It should be here

2057
03:32:43.970 --> 03:32:47.010
Orlando Sequera: at 5 houses, but you only completed 4.

2058
03:32:47.070 --> 03:32:52.539
Orlando Sequera: That might be valid. There might be a valid explanation for that, but it's just showing you where you are.

2059
03:32:52.750 --> 03:33:12.360
Orlando Sequera: It's not taken into account other variables. It's just showing you the based on earned value and plan value. That's it. Comparing your actuals, what happened to what you plan for? There might be a valid explanation for that. That's what you have to work on with your team members and with your stakeholders, because you're going to get

2060
03:33:12.370 --> 03:33:14.259
Orlando Sequera: You're going to get asked on that question.

2061
03:33:14.560 --> 03:33:15.190
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2062
03:33:19.040 --> 03:33:30.859
Orlando Sequera: A. Is their formulas different to apply to those cases. No, that's why we analyze all their variables to put them into context. This is just taking, taking, comparing your actuals against your plan values

2063
03:33:33.700 --> 03:33:34.600
Orlando Sequera: at

2064
03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:35.880
Orlando Sequera: another question

2065
03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:45.639
Orlando Sequera: at point in time we must have partial completion of other houses. Or yes, you have partial completion. But you're adding

2066
03:33:45.860 --> 03:33:50.519
Orlando Sequera: that partial completion express in dollars. That is your own value.

2067
03:33:50.580 --> 03:33:51.660
Orlando Sequera: and

2068
03:33:52.470 --> 03:33:53.640
Orlando Sequera: that's how you do it.

2069
03:34:05.950 --> 03:34:12.749
Orlando Sequera: Do these calculations also also assume that you have a contract that is not fixed price.

2070
03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:15.070
Orlando Sequera: Do we address contracts with

2071
03:34:15.740 --> 03:34:26.580
Orlando Sequera: procurement? We're not taking that into account right now we are. We estimated the budget. When you build the budget. You estimate it the cost of each house. So we already

2072
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:36.629
Orlando Sequera: we already address that in planning we are an execution of a project. Make sure that you also understand where we are in the project. We are an execution right now. Okay.

2073
03:34:38.110 --> 03:34:40.649
Orlando Sequera: So we already took care of that. We already.

2074
03:34:40.730 --> 03:34:44.260
Orlando Sequera: That's how we were able to to determine the budget, for the project

2075
03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:56.409
Orlando Sequera: Will procurement cost changes that would affect budget powder, risk, register. Yes.

2076
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:59.109
Orlando Sequera: Will that be part of the calculations here. No.

2077
03:35:00.980 --> 03:35:02.489
Orlando Sequera: we're just comparing

2078
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:08.889
Orlando Sequera: your actual to what you plan for. That's all we're doing.

2079
03:35:11.420 --> 03:35:14.689
Orlando Sequera: Another important question for the exam. And I see this coming up

2080
03:35:14.930 --> 03:35:16.379
Orlando Sequera: during the exam.

2081
03:35:16.890 --> 03:35:26.460
Orlando Sequera: Do we need to memorize the formulas for the exam? And are we going to be applying this formulas in detail in the exam. The short answer is.

2082
03:35:26.540 --> 03:35:36.690
Orlando Sequera: No, however, I'm gonna put a big, a big asterisk here a big caveat. You need to know mainly the interpretation of the results

2083
03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:40.110
Orlando Sequera: the type of questions that you might get. Are

2084
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:50.939
Orlando Sequera: you are working on Project X, Yc: this is an example, and that's why I want you to go to a test Prep and take questions. There are many and value mentioned related questions.

2085
03:35:51.330 --> 03:35:53.040
Orlando Sequera: You're working in

2086
03:35:53.170 --> 03:36:01.890
Orlando Sequera: a Project Xyc: right now, and your Cpi is 0 point 8, 6, and your spi is 1.0 2.

2087
03:36:02.270 --> 03:36:04.740
Orlando Sequera: What can you tell about that project?

2088
03:36:05.140 --> 03:36:16.340
Orlando Sequera: Usually that's the type of questions that you're going to be getting okay. So what can you say about the project? And they're going to give you the conditions and you have to select the right answer. So what can you say about the project? I want to open up the chat.

2089
03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:17.310
Orlando Sequera: Your

2090
03:36:17.530 --> 03:36:20.850
Orlando Sequera: Cpi is 0 point 8, 6, and your

2091
03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:23.460
Orlando Sequera: spi is

2092
03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:27.090
Orlando Sequera: 1.0 2.

2093
03:36:27.350 --> 03:36:29.010
Orlando Sequera: What can you say about the project

2094
03:36:32.380 --> 03:36:42.250
Orlando Sequera: over Budget and ahead of schedule? Correct. That's what you can tell about the project with that information, so please make sure that for the exam. And I'm going to post the chat.

2095
03:36:42.520 --> 03:36:49.750
Orlando Sequera: Please make sure that for the exam. You understand clearly the interpretation of the results.

2096
03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:52.870
Orlando Sequera: It doesn't hurt to know the formulas.

2097
03:36:53.030 --> 03:37:02.959
Orlando Sequera: They're not that complicated. And over time by repetition you can learn them. But more importantly, we need to know what a cpi of 1.0 2 means

2098
03:37:02.990 --> 03:37:08.340
Orlando Sequera: what an Sp: I have 0 point. 8, 2 means. We need to know that in regards to our project.

2099
03:37:08.650 --> 03:37:09.410
Orlando Sequera: and

2100
03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:16.079
Orlando Sequera: and the same Ha! How that gonna impact the our eac. So

2101
03:37:16.370 --> 03:37:26.469
Orlando Sequera: we need to understand more importantly the definitions, then the interpretation of the results than anything else in previous versions of the Pmp. Exam.

2102
03:37:26.710 --> 03:37:39.210
Orlando Sequera: Yes, you have to know the formulas really well, but this exam is different. To start in 2021 is different. You need to know the interpretation of the results, for the scenario questions

2103
03:37:39.240 --> 03:37:44.500
Orlando Sequera: it doesn't it doesn't hurt. It does not hurt. If you're able to learn the

2104
03:37:45.090 --> 03:37:47.449
Orlando Sequera: by all means go ahead and do it. But more.

2105
03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:51.330
Orlando Sequera: You need to know the interpretation of the results.

2106
03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:52.300
Orlando Sequera: Okay

2107
03:37:52.900 --> 03:37:54.910
Orlando Sequera: in your resources that

2108
03:37:55.040 --> 03:38:01.060
Orlando Sequera: both in per sepio and in Github for those number CPU users. You have a list of

2109
03:38:01.140 --> 03:38:12.449
Orlando Sequera: the formulas for the Pmp. Exam. You have it there consolidated, put together for you, so you can review them and understand the interpretation. Okay.

2110
03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:16.739
Orlando Sequera: all right. So let's go ahead and continue with the content.

2111
03:38:18.110 --> 03:38:19.330
Orlando Sequera: We have

2112
03:38:24.690 --> 03:38:26.330
Orlando Sequera: few more.

2113
03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:31.029
Orlando Sequera: We have a lot of content still, some content to go over. So let's continue.

2114
03:38:32.470 --> 03:38:39.659
Orlando Sequera: And another aspect that we have to take into account in when it comes to project. Performance is quality.

2115
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:43.619
Orlando Sequera: Quality is, as we learned before, is

2116
03:38:43.900 --> 03:38:47.809
Orlando Sequera: closely related to the acceptance criteria of our

2117
03:38:47.900 --> 03:38:54.650
Orlando Sequera: deliverables, and it is very important in the product approaches that we have to produce the project deliverables.

2118
03:38:54.890 --> 03:39:02.829
Orlando Sequera: What project teams evaluate the quality of a deliverable? Remember how well are we meeting their requirements. We do that through inspection and testing

2119
03:39:02.910 --> 03:39:06.709
Orlando Sequera: project activities are going to go through reviews and audits as well.

2120
03:39:06.780 --> 03:39:10.869
Orlando Sequera: It's really important. The main goal of quality is to

2121
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:16.419
Orlando Sequera: focus on prevention and detection of possible errors and defects.

2122
03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:17.760
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2123
03:39:17.930 --> 03:39:18.820
Orlando Sequera: So

2124
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:21.350
Orlando Sequera: that's what we do with quality.

2125
03:39:26.540 --> 03:39:30.320
Orlando Sequera: In order to evaluate and manage quality in our projects.

2126
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:33.620
Orlando Sequera: We are going to.

2127
03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:37.799
Orlando Sequera: It's where you see comes into play co quality control.

2128
03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:46.990
Orlando Sequera: right? So we're going to use quality control. If we're following a predictive approach. We're going to use quality control to ensure that

2129
03:39:47.130 --> 03:40:01.260
Orlando Sequera: our deliverables. What the team members are producing with the project work is meeting functional and non functional requirements, because that's the whole point of quality. We're going to be able to identify possible improvements.

2130
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:18.440
Orlando Sequera: continuous improvement. We talked about that before we have to make sure that we are aligned with compliance requirements, because remember non-compliance, can it's a make or break deal for your project. It can. It can have a major impact on your project negative. If we.

2131
03:40:18.450 --> 03:40:33.269
Orlando Sequera: in in the event of a non-compliance, we're gonna give feedback on any variances, and we're going to be able to identify potential approaches to address non-compliance. And this is an ongoing effort that we perform with

2132
03:40:34.130 --> 03:40:35.960
Orlando Sequera: quality control

2133
03:40:36.250 --> 03:40:36.960
Orlando Sequera: But

2134
03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:39.449
Orlando Sequera: we also have quality assurance.

2135
03:40:39.580 --> 03:40:45.800
Orlando Sequera: Okay, quality assurance happens before quality, assurance. I'm. Going to explain the the big difference between

2136
03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:48.569
Orlando Sequera: quality control and quality, assurance.

2137
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:50.900
Orlando Sequera: quality, assurance. Qa.

2138
03:40:51.970 --> 03:40:52.910
Orlando Sequera: What

2139
03:40:53.450 --> 03:40:59.990
Orlando Sequera: we look at with Qa is how well are we following the

2140
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:05.300
Orlando Sequera: the guidelines, the policies, the templates

2141
03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:07.550
Orlando Sequera: that we said that we were going to use.

2142
03:41:07.650 --> 03:41:26.450
Orlando Sequera: or the quality aspect of our project? They those opa that we review before the quality policy. That's a major opa, and any guideline anything that is applicable to our project. That's what we do with Qa: I'm. Going to use an example, a simple example.

2143
03:41:26.650 --> 03:41:34.829
Orlando Sequera: A restaurant, a restaurant is going to allow us to understand the difference between Q. A. And Qc. So Qa. In a restaurant is.

2144
03:41:35.020 --> 03:41:43.560
Orlando Sequera: for example, we look at the kitchen of the restaurant. All the employees work in the restaurant, not only the kitchen employees they have to.

2145
03:41:44.310 --> 03:42:01.809
Orlando Sequera: They have to follow the guidelines that come from the Department of Health right, the Health Department. They have guidelines, strict guidance that anyone that works at a restaurant has to follow. They have to wash their hands with warm water for at least 20 s. They what they have to wear

2146
03:42:01.820 --> 03:42:11.099
Orlando Sequera: nets for her nets for their hair. They have to wear gloves. They have to wear masks in some cases, etc. Right? So

2147
03:42:12.090 --> 03:42:21.640
Orlando Sequera: that is how well we followed. Those are, and then we have some guidance for storing food and for cleaning and sanitizing new 10 sales.

2148
03:42:21.730 --> 03:42:29.370
Orlando Sequera: and we also have guidance for keeping keeping the the the kitchen surfaces clean.

2149
03:42:29.480 --> 03:42:30.240
Orlando Sequera: So

2150
03:42:30.680 --> 03:42:33.179
Orlando Sequera: Qa is going to help us to

2151
03:42:33.240 --> 03:42:37.660
Orlando Sequera: make sure that we are following that guidance. We're gonna perform an audit.

2152
03:42:37.770 --> 03:42:40.599
Orlando Sequera: And what we're going to look at is our

2153
03:42:40.910 --> 03:42:58.099
Orlando Sequera: our processes. How well are we following those quality processes that we have to follow? That's what we do with Qa in, and it's more from a. From a. From a proactive standpoint. Because if we have good Qa processes in place.

2154
03:42:58.170 --> 03:42:59.610
Orlando Sequera: that means that

2155
03:42:59.700 --> 03:43:00.590
Orlando Sequera: when

2156
03:43:01.490 --> 03:43:04.090
Orlando Sequera: when the deliverables are produced

2157
03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:07.509
Orlando Sequera: when Qc. Comes into play.

2158
03:43:07.540 --> 03:43:12.469
Orlando Sequera: then if you, if you have good Qa, it's going to translate into good Qc.

2159
03:43:12.510 --> 03:43:14.140
Orlando Sequera: Qc. In the restaurant.

2160
03:43:14.230 --> 03:43:31.039
Orlando Sequera: is with the deliverables. Where are the Liberals in the restaurant? Well, what a the meals that are prepared! How quickly are the meals being served to the customers are the tables clean it, the silver were, and dishes are they clean? So that is.

2161
03:43:31.050 --> 03:43:49.189
Orlando Sequera: you see it's customer facing whether the Liberals in the hand of the customer. So if we have dirty issues, that's a defect, that's a problem that we have to address, or if the service is taken, if if if it's taking too long for the service to bring the meals to the customers. That's the problem. That's: a. Qc. Problem: okay. So

2162
03:43:49.280 --> 03:43:54.439
Orlando Sequera: you a. Is how Well, we follow the quality, procedures and guidelines, you see, is

2163
03:43:55.160 --> 03:44:07.399
Orlando Sequera: about the deliverables in the hands of the customer. Any defects, any errors in front of the in in front of the customer. So that is the difference between the 2. We're talking about Qc. Here.

2164
03:44:07.420 --> 03:44:13.330
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and we do that in both approaches. We do it in predictive. We also do it in adjo.

2165
03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:17.670
Orlando Sequera: We go over in agile. We have.

2166
03:44:17.740 --> 03:44:23.020
Orlando Sequera: we have metrics that we have to meet, we make commitments, and we measure a

2167
03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:35.060
Orlando Sequera: how well things are going in our agile projects, and this is where they they! They! They lean 6. Sigma, the world can come and help us make sure that the number of defects is cap to a minimum.

2168
03:44:35.380 --> 03:44:36.090
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2169
03:44:36.250 --> 03:44:38.449
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more about a quality audit

2170
03:44:40.270 --> 03:44:42.299
Orlando Sequera: quality Audits can be done

2171
03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:46.980
Orlando Sequera: in a scheduled way, or they can be done a

2172
03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:48.250
Orlando Sequera: randomly

2173
03:44:48.330 --> 03:44:51.349
Orlando Sequera: they can cover. We're trying to look at

2174
03:44:51.550 --> 03:44:55.459
Orlando Sequera: how well we're following the quality management policy

2175
03:44:55.690 --> 03:45:03.179
Orlando Sequera: we take into account the the cost of quality, the quality process, design. And we use analytical methods. Okay.

2176
03:45:03.330 --> 03:45:17.950
Orlando Sequera: with a quality audit, so is the the goal is to understand, how well are we following the quality processes and procedures that we said that we were going to follow for our project. And, by the way, Where, where are those?

2177
03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:22.159
Orlando Sequera: Why did you process some procedures that we have to follow for a project? What

2178
03:45:22.300 --> 03:45:25.470
Orlando Sequera: artifact that we create that covers

2179
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:33.699
Orlando Sequera: a the quality, procedures and and guidelines for a project where we're what do I have to review what I have to check for that?

2180
03:45:36.920 --> 03:45:39.280
Orlando Sequera: No quality. We're talking about quality.

2181
03:45:42.580 --> 03:45:44.169
Orlando Sequera: The quality management plan.

2182
03:45:44.260 --> 03:45:46.450
Orlando Sequera: Correct the quality management plan.

2183
03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:48.799
Orlando Sequera: That's correct.

2184
03:45:50.900 --> 03:45:52.989
Orlando Sequera: All right. Great job. I'm going to pause the chat

2185
03:45:56.850 --> 03:45:58.079
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2186
03:45:58.280 --> 03:46:00.809
Orlando Sequera: quality control. Do you have multiple tools

2187
03:46:01.050 --> 03:46:02.110
Orlando Sequera: and

2188
03:46:02.480 --> 03:46:05.430
Orlando Sequera: we have a few here. You might have some

2189
03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:09.930
Orlando Sequera: data gathering techniques for probably control, like checklist or check sheets.

2190
03:46:10.040 --> 03:46:29.959
Orlando Sequera: You can use some statistical sampling, following statistical rules, in which imagine, if you're working in a manufacturing, setting, and you're producing a 1 million Parts, and to review every single part, it'd be very time consuming. So, using the statistical principles, you can get a sample of the entire population. And what happens to that

2191
03:46:30.220 --> 03:46:34.010
Orlando Sequera: sample is going to be applicable to the entire population.

2192
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:38.569
Orlando Sequera: You can also send questioners and surveys. You can perform

2193
03:46:40.220 --> 03:46:45.750
Orlando Sequera: performance reviews. You can perform root costs analysis to understand the root cost of

2194
03:46:45.970 --> 03:46:59.310
Orlando Sequera: any problem. And you can also use some data representation techniques like cost and effect diagram, scatter diagrams, histograms, predator charts and control charts. So let's go over them in a little bit more detail

2195
03:47:02.390 --> 03:47:07.439
Orlando Sequera: to gather data. You can use check sheets to collect data. You can plot this data.

2196
03:47:07.700 --> 03:47:14.569
Orlando Sequera: You can understand the significant ones using the pareto chart which is gonna be able to allow you to isolate

2197
03:47:14.600 --> 03:47:15.340
Orlando Sequera: they

2198
03:47:15.450 --> 03:47:19.279
Orlando Sequera: more. The most important. The root cost of the problem is usually

2199
03:47:19.320 --> 03:47:24.040
Orlando Sequera: 20%. The prom of the the cost is account for 80% of the problems.

2200
03:47:24.340 --> 03:47:28.689
Orlando Sequera: and you can also use the cost and effect analysis to understand

2201
03:47:29.400 --> 03:47:33.770
Orlando Sequera: problems and possible solutions, and also a scatter analysis.

2202
03:47:34.400 --> 03:47:38.649
Orlando Sequera: One tool that is widely used in quality

2203
03:47:39.140 --> 03:47:40.710
Orlando Sequera: control is

2204
03:47:41.650 --> 03:47:46.550
Orlando Sequera: the Ishika. What diagram, which unfortunately has

2205
03:47:46.890 --> 03:47:48.869
Orlando Sequera: 3 or 4 different names.

2206
03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:55.660
Orlando Sequera: This is the Ishikawa diagram, also known as the Constant effect diagram.

2207
03:47:55.710 --> 03:48:03.400
Orlando Sequera: also known as the fishbone diagram, actually 4 names, also known as the yy diagram. Okay.

2208
03:48:03.580 --> 03:48:05.680
Orlando Sequera: it resembles a fish phone.

2209
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:09.889
Orlando Sequera: The last name of the author that came up with this tool is Ishikawa

2210
03:48:10.340 --> 03:48:12.319
Orlando Sequera: A, and

2211
03:48:13.060 --> 03:48:32.260
Orlando Sequera: it's also called Why, Why? And it's also called a cost and effect diagram. So it's going to help you to break down the problem into different areas to different branches. So you can then start asking the questions to try to determine which one is the root cause of a problem.

2212
03:48:32.270 --> 03:48:38.019
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's what you are able to achieve when you use the Ishikawa

2213
03:48:38.190 --> 03:48:45.670
Orlando Sequera: diagram, also known as Fish Pond diagram, also known as cost and effect diagram, also known as yy diagram.

2214
03:48:46.380 --> 03:48:47.220
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2215
03:48:47.490 --> 03:48:49.230
Orlando Sequera: then we have

2216
03:48:49.280 --> 03:48:56.380
Orlando Sequera: scatter diagrams, and here you're trying to understand a relationship between 2 variables.

2217
03:48:57.080 --> 03:49:06.770
Orlando Sequera: Sometimes there might be a correlation, or sometimes there might not be a correlation at all. But that's what you're trying to determine. This is another tool that is using quality control.

2218
03:49:07.410 --> 03:49:18.560
Orlando Sequera: Another tool that we use in quality control is what we call control charts. It's basically which you're going to have a graphic representation of

2219
03:49:18.690 --> 03:49:21.950
Orlando Sequera: that. That's what we have with this.

2220
03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:23.630
Orlando Sequera: The blue line here.

2221
03:49:23.650 --> 03:49:29.970
Orlando Sequera: going up and down with the different plot points. That is a process. And we what you try

2222
03:49:30.030 --> 03:49:35.750
Orlando Sequera: to understand, based on certain specific limits, you usually have an upper control limit

2223
03:49:36.350 --> 03:49:43.660
Orlando Sequera: and a lower control limit. And then what is called a mean you're trying to understand if your process is

2224
03:49:43.730 --> 03:49:45.060
Orlando Sequera: under control.

2225
03:49:45.290 --> 03:49:56.399
Orlando Sequera: So in this case, if you have one plot point that is, outside of any of the control limits, upper control or lower control, your process is out of control.

2226
03:49:56.540 --> 03:49:57.260
Orlando Sequera: hey?

2227
03:49:57.340 --> 03:50:00.240
Orlando Sequera: Also pay attention to the rule of 7.

2228
03:50:00.970 --> 03:50:03.999
Orlando Sequera: The rule of 7 me means basically

2229
03:50:04.240 --> 03:50:10.660
Orlando Sequera: in very simple terms. It's not a quality Exam: this is, we just need to know when

2230
03:50:10.930 --> 03:50:14.519
Orlando Sequera: when a control chart is out of control

2231
03:50:14.730 --> 03:50:27.410
Orlando Sequera: or a process is out of control based on the control chart. If you have 7 plot points trending up or trending down, even within the opera control limit and the lower control limit. Your

2232
03:50:27.490 --> 03:50:30.440
Orlando Sequera: process is also out of control.

2233
03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:34.050
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's what the rule of 7 means. That's

2234
03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:37.250
Orlando Sequera: as deep as we need to go when it comes to quality.

2235
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:38.330
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2236
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:41.599
Orlando Sequera: all right. We also have another tool.

2237
03:50:41.930 --> 03:50:44.379
Orlando Sequera: We have what is called a histogram

2238
03:50:45.010 --> 03:50:48.500
Orlando Sequera: and pareto chart. It's going to help us to evaluate

2239
03:50:48.570 --> 03:50:49.400
Orlando Sequera: they.

2240
03:50:50.100 --> 03:50:55.560
Orlando Sequera: And whenever we have a problem with trying to isolate, which one is the most

2241
03:50:55.610 --> 03:51:14.319
Orlando Sequera: is a what 20 of the of the possible. If we're facing a problem, what 20% off the the the cost of the possible causes of the problem is is the corporate of 80% of the problems so based on this is applicable to a restaurant complaints. That is the permanent that we have

2242
03:51:14.350 --> 03:51:16.630
Orlando Sequera: basically telling us this predator.

2243
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:20.520
Orlando Sequera: So the complaints are coming from the items being overpriced.

2244
03:51:20.560 --> 03:51:24.689
Orlando Sequera: So basically what is telling us here is that we have to

2245
03:51:24.820 --> 03:51:25.770
Orlando Sequera: a

2246
03:51:27.350 --> 03:51:44.010
Orlando Sequera: our prices in our menu, that's all is telling us so it doesn't address any root cost of the problem, or it does let alone a possible solution. It's just pointing out where are the most problems compared to a the possible areas

2247
03:51:44.020 --> 03:51:48.720
Orlando Sequera: associated with that problem. That's what we get with the pareto, chart or histogram.

2248
03:51:49.470 --> 03:51:51.390
Orlando Sequera: What else we have? A quality

2249
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:55.069
Orlando Sequera: quality is, as we have said before.

2250
03:51:56.050 --> 03:52:03.289
Orlando Sequera: in a in of projects, is linked to the acceptance criteria. How well are we meeting that acceptance criteria?

2251
03:52:03.350 --> 03:52:08.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And this is important. We to use this. This criteria can be updated

2252
03:52:08.970 --> 03:52:11.010
Orlando Sequera: and a

2253
03:52:11.410 --> 03:52:17.430
Orlando Sequera: but we always gotta make sure that's how we manage quality in adaptive projects.

2254
03:52:17.610 --> 03:52:20.060
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to

2255
03:52:20.440 --> 03:52:22.209
Orlando Sequera: very fine deliverables.

2256
03:52:22.980 --> 03:52:29.799
Orlando Sequera: the project teams. If we're following a Nigel approach. Correct team is gonna verify deliverable based on quality standards

2257
03:52:29.830 --> 03:52:34.089
Orlando Sequera: based on the level of tolerance and quality metrics.

2258
03:52:34.290 --> 03:52:39.869
Orlando Sequera: There the Liberals are gonna be presenting like and accepted by the customer we're gonna perform.

2259
03:52:40.210 --> 03:52:58.519
Orlando Sequera: This is what we mean by scope validation. We do it in that we're going to present the deliverables at the end of each iteration in the we're going to capture that sign off that acceptance from the customers, some that they will turn, maybe accept it. Some of them are not going to be accepted. But that's

2260
03:52:59.480 --> 03:53:15.379
Orlando Sequera: and verify the Liberals, because we have to go through that's called verification process with the team members. That's our first safety net that we have when it comes to quality in address and also in predictive. So it's internally with the team. We verify the deliberals.

2261
03:53:15.890 --> 03:53:19.079
Orlando Sequera: and then internally with the team. And then we validate

2262
03:53:19.100 --> 03:53:29.230
Orlando Sequera: that deliverables with the customer. That's the difference between verification that is done by the team members. The validation is done with the customers.

2263
03:53:29.260 --> 03:53:29.910
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2264
03:53:31.400 --> 03:53:32.440
Orlando Sequera: also.

2265
03:53:35.190 --> 03:53:38.510
Orlando Sequera: as we go through this processes.

2266
03:53:38.590 --> 03:53:41.930
Orlando Sequera: you probably have seen, as some of you have pointed, that out

2267
03:53:42.230 --> 03:53:43.490
Orlando Sequera: there are

2268
03:53:43.710 --> 03:53:45.229
Orlando Sequera: going to be risks

2269
03:53:45.270 --> 03:53:47.980
Orlando Sequera: that are going to that might come up

2270
03:53:48.030 --> 03:53:53.620
Orlando Sequera: based on when we are monitoring the performance of our project. Absolutely so. This is huge.

2271
03:53:53.690 --> 03:53:57.489
Orlando Sequera: especially when it comes to quality risk. Monitoring

2272
03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:07.379
Orlando Sequera: is ongoing and risk. Analysis is an ongoing process, and they have an impact on quality. So we got. We have to take that into account.

2273
03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:09.600
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to

2274
03:54:09.650 --> 03:54:13.539
Orlando Sequera: that the fragile approaches we take into account

2275
03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:27.870
Orlando Sequera: risk management. We try, we try to uncover and address. Uncertainty so risks as early as possible in our project, and part of the the work that the team is going to be doing in each iteration is also addressing risks

2276
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:30.509
Orlando Sequera: as early as possible in the project.

2277
03:54:30.640 --> 03:54:34.979
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and we do the same in the predictive approach.

2278
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:39.229
Orlando Sequera: We have to address those risks as they as they come over

2279
03:54:39.730 --> 03:54:40.410
Orlando Sequera: all right

2280
03:54:44.610 --> 03:54:49.479
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to monitoring risks. And this is specific to predictive

2281
03:54:49.900 --> 03:54:52.000
Orlando Sequera: the guidance that we should follow.

2282
03:54:52.970 --> 03:55:06.049
Orlando Sequera: The decision making process should be based on current information about overall risk exposure to our project and individual risks. We have to continuously monitor the status of those risks.

2283
03:55:06.230 --> 03:55:08.370
Orlando Sequera: We have to constantly

2284
03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:11.020
Orlando Sequera: evaluate

2285
03:55:11.220 --> 03:55:20.839
Orlando Sequera: and try to identify new risks because risks evolve risks are not static. They are dynamic. They evolve over time.

2286
03:55:20.880 --> 03:55:21.600
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2287
03:55:21.780 --> 03:55:23.510
Orlando Sequera: any written

2288
03:55:24.170 --> 03:55:29.509
Orlando Sequera: any risk that we, at the new risk that we identify. We need to add them to our risk register.

2289
03:55:29.740 --> 03:55:36.730
Orlando Sequera: We have to also reassess current risks. What what do we mean by that reassess, the probability of impact?

2290
03:55:37.680 --> 03:55:41.399
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Sorry, reassess, the probability of a current or likelihood

2291
03:55:41.870 --> 03:55:43.720
Orlando Sequera: and reassess the impact

2292
03:55:43.780 --> 03:55:46.020
Orlando Sequera: that can also evolve over time

2293
03:55:46.260 --> 03:55:52.089
Orlando Sequera: and any risks that we were able to address that materialize and address a.

2294
03:55:52.480 --> 03:55:57.919
Orlando Sequera: we close them in our race register. Okay. And this is an ongoing

2295
03:55:58.220 --> 03:55:59.039
Orlando Sequera: task.

2296
03:55:59.250 --> 03:56:01.509
Orlando Sequera: This is what we call monitoring risks

2297
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:07.359
Orlando Sequera: and a few guidelines, questions that can help us to to do that.

2298
03:56:07.580 --> 03:56:10.690
Orlando Sequera: our our project assumptions still valid.

2299
03:56:11.240 --> 03:56:17.949
Orlando Sequera: And this is where some of the questions that that some of you have a about in value management.

2300
03:56:18.080 --> 03:56:28.319
Orlando Sequera: the price increase of some of the materials that we're using. Those are assumptions that we made. We have to validate their assumptions, those assumptions.

2301
03:56:28.420 --> 03:56:30.900
Orlando Sequera: And because that can also change.

2302
03:56:31.100 --> 03:56:44.840
Orlando Sequera: we are working with supplier a, and we learn in the past. They work. They deliver on time. But now supplier a is being affected by the global supply chain issues, and they're not going to be delivering on time. Let's validate Those assumptions

2303
03:56:45.020 --> 03:56:46.119
Orlando Sequera: have

2304
03:56:46.180 --> 03:56:50.350
Orlando Sequera: change, or have they been retired? So that's why we evaluate risks.

2305
03:56:51.090 --> 03:56:55.959
Orlando Sequera: Are we following risk management policies and procedures as we should.

2306
03:56:56.350 --> 03:56:56.940
Good

2307
03:56:57.390 --> 03:56:59.500
Orlando Sequera: have we been able.

2308
03:56:59.910 --> 03:57:02.159
Orlando Sequera: since we identified new risks?

2309
03:57:02.650 --> 03:57:06.130
Orlando Sequera: Have we modified our contingency reserves

2310
03:57:06.280 --> 03:57:11.400
Orlando Sequera: Initially, we have only 10. We had only 10 risks identified. Now we have 25

2311
03:57:11.540 --> 03:57:19.859
Orlando Sequera: have continuously, research being modified. We need money, and we need time to address those risks. They materialize. Now we have more? Have

2312
03:57:19.970 --> 03:57:28.210
Orlando Sequera: Have we don't? Have we done that? We have more money and more time to address those possible new risks? Do we need to perform a risk. Audit.

2313
03:57:28.390 --> 03:57:29.000
hey?

2314
03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:33.359
Orlando Sequera: All right, and that takes us to.

2315
03:57:34.440 --> 03:57:35.890
Orlando Sequera: They reserves.

2316
03:57:37.130 --> 03:57:39.050
Orlando Sequera: We have to perform

2317
03:57:39.140 --> 03:57:40.860
Orlando Sequera: a reserve analysis.

2318
03:57:40.940 --> 03:57:42.220
Orlando Sequera: to understand

2319
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:45.249
Orlando Sequera: the amount of risk on the project.

2320
03:57:45.320 --> 03:57:49.309
Orlando Sequera: and the amount of money that we need in our

2321
03:57:49.760 --> 03:57:55.419
Orlando Sequera: scale, in in our, in our budget, and also in the amount of time that we need in our schedule

2322
03:57:55.760 --> 03:57:57.260
Orlando Sequera: to address

2323
03:57:58.220 --> 03:57:59.510
Orlando Sequera: those risks

2324
03:57:59.590 --> 03:58:03.360
Orlando Sequera: that remain in our risk Register. Okay.

2325
03:58:04.080 --> 03:58:06.010
Orlando Sequera: some of you, by

2326
03:58:06.090 --> 03:58:09.300
Orlando Sequera: wonder. Well how much money on top of what we

2327
03:58:09.370 --> 03:58:12.760
Orlando Sequera: the budget to address.

2328
03:58:12.860 --> 03:58:14.610
Orlando Sequera: to address possible risks

2329
03:58:14.770 --> 03:58:21.710
Orlando Sequera: for contingency reserves? Do we need to have? I have seen that, as I mentioned before, it changes from

2330
03:58:21.800 --> 03:58:27.610
Orlando Sequera: organization, to organization, industry to industry. I have seen in some cases that is 5%,

2331
03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:31.310
Orlando Sequera: some other places I have seen. I have seen 10%.

2332
03:58:31.480 --> 03:58:33.590
Orlando Sequera: It changes. Okay, but

2333
03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:35.859
Orlando Sequera: those are the values that I have seen.

2334
03:58:36.080 --> 03:58:37.030
Orlando Sequera: Then

2335
03:58:37.650 --> 03:58:48.770
Orlando Sequera: remember that we also have management reserves. It's not only contingency reserves, so what we're doing here is to go back. This we did. We do initially in planning.

2336
03:58:49.100 --> 03:58:56.319
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we determine how much money, how much buffer we need in continuous to reserves for those risks that we identify.

2337
03:58:56.400 --> 03:59:02.949
Orlando Sequera: and also how much money and how much time do we need in the management reserves

2338
03:59:03.900 --> 03:59:06.930
Orlando Sequera: to address risks that we were not able to identify.

2339
03:59:06.990 --> 03:59:07.680
Orlando Sequera: But

2340
03:59:08.260 --> 03:59:18.840
Orlando Sequera: over time. As we work in our project, we have to reevaluate that and review the reserves. This is what we're doing here. Oh, well! When we we were conducting our planning efforts

2341
03:59:18.890 --> 03:59:29.230
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of our project, we accounted for 25 risks or 50 risks, for now we have a 100 open risks in our project.

2342
03:59:29.540 --> 03:59:32.500
Orlando Sequera: So we have to review the the reserves

2343
03:59:33.040 --> 03:59:42.369
Orlando Sequera: we have to review the contingency reserves on the management reserves, and whether to determine whether we need more money on time or we are okay.

2344
03:59:42.500 --> 03:59:46.279
Orlando Sequera: right? So that is, that's what we do here.

2345
03:59:46.910 --> 03:59:47.990
Orlando Sequera: Then.

2346
03:59:49.090 --> 03:59:49.660
Okay.

2347
03:59:50.570 --> 03:59:54.409
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the the race register. This is a living document.

2348
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:56.369
Orlando Sequera: Any new risk that

2349
03:59:56.650 --> 04:00:04.270
Orlando Sequera: it's identified at any point in the project at any moment has to be added to your risk register. You gotta remind your

2350
04:00:04.410 --> 04:00:11.619
Orlando Sequera: your team members and also your stakeholders external stakeholders. That risk identification did not end

2351
04:00:11.770 --> 04:00:19.990
Orlando Sequera: when when we were planning. We? We're working on planning efforts. It's an ongoing effort. Okay, Any new brisks

2352
04:00:20.090 --> 04:00:32.159
Orlando Sequera: that anybody is able to identify that could affect the project. They need to make its way to the risk register. This is ongoing through the entire life cycle of the project, and any existing risks.

2353
04:00:32.860 --> 04:00:36.980
Orlando Sequera: If the probability of occurrence changes or

2354
04:00:37.140 --> 04:00:38.289
Orlando Sequera: the impact

2355
04:00:38.330 --> 04:00:42.349
Orlando Sequera: changes that needs to be updated as well in the risk register.

2356
04:00:49.870 --> 04:00:50.660
Orlando Sequera: So

2357
04:00:52.150 --> 04:00:55.319
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to risks in your projects.

2358
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:57.530
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna open up the chat for

2359
04:00:57.700 --> 04:01:02.060
Orlando Sequera: a few seconds. Which ones do you think of? The most serious?

2360
04:01:05.320 --> 04:01:06.260
Orlando Sequera: The chat is.

2361
04:01:07.210 --> 04:01:08.150
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Past

2362
04:01:09.600 --> 04:01:14.369
Orlando Sequera: negative race Exactly. And any race that could impact your

2363
04:01:15.250 --> 04:01:19.100
Orlando Sequera: have any impacts that could have any risk that could affect your

2364
04:01:19.160 --> 04:01:25.109
Orlando Sequera: If your broadcast, your scheduled, etc., your scope, etc. So correct

2365
04:01:25.320 --> 04:01:26.600
Orlando Sequera: compliance

2366
04:01:27.610 --> 04:01:30.579
Orlando Sequera: issues, etc. Great job.

2367
04:01:33.420 --> 04:01:34.860
Orlando Sequera: I'm: going to post a chat

2368
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:36.250
Orlando Sequera: correct

2369
04:01:37.120 --> 04:01:38.320
Orlando Sequera: in. Now.

2370
04:01:41.560 --> 04:01:42.750
Orlando Sequera: again.

2371
04:01:43.740 --> 04:02:03.189
Orlando Sequera: one super important aspect. This is a category of of risk category. Okay, and it's also a type of requirement that we have to address compliance. We mentioned that on day one and we're mentioning now that again on day 5 is super important to keep in mind for the exam and for your

2372
04:02:03.200 --> 04:02:14.010
Orlando Sequera: for your daily tasks as a project manager, compliance, and non-compliance are the highest priority in any risk management project

2373
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:28.229
Orlando Sequera: a environment in any risk, match and product environment. The anything related to compliance, risk, compliance, related risk are huge, because this is 1 one of the things that can make or break your project. Okay. So

2374
04:02:29.550 --> 04:02:32.989
Orlando Sequera: it is important to have either a designated stakeholder

2375
04:02:33.400 --> 04:02:44.370
Orlando Sequera: or a group of stakeholders that are accountable for each compliance, requirement for your project, and also that are authorized to sign off and approve any compliance requirements.

2376
04:02:44.720 --> 04:02:51.410
Orlando Sequera: Many of these approval, final approvals may not be possible until shortly before project completion. That's

2377
04:02:51.470 --> 04:02:54.969
Orlando Sequera: in most cases, that's what happens, because

2378
04:02:54.990 --> 04:03:08.089
Orlando Sequera: compliance is subject to ongoing, testing, ongoing verification ongoing validation. During the project. So you might have to wait until the very end of the project in some cases to get those final approvals, and that's fine. Right

2379
04:03:08.130 --> 04:03:15.710
Orlando Sequera: A. And then they continue. This continued review is going to help you to catch any potential threats.

2380
04:03:15.880 --> 04:03:25.420
Orlando Sequera: to compliance and determine the right or the best course of action to address the non-compliance before it has an impact on your project.

2381
04:03:25.720 --> 04:03:36.870
Orlando Sequera: whether it is on your scheduled, your cost or any other area of your project. Okay, that is the benefit that comes with this compliance. Sign off so you can take

2382
04:03:37.010 --> 04:03:40.490
Orlando Sequera: action before an accident. The accident happens.

2383
04:03:41.690 --> 04:03:47.200
Orlando Sequera: Do you also have to take into account business value. This is tied up to

2384
04:03:48.160 --> 04:03:56.450
Orlando Sequera: A. The ways of working with this as accurate, and you also value is important. We get a monitor and make sure that we are

2385
04:03:56.580 --> 04:03:58.439
Orlando Sequera: covering. We are.

2386
04:03:59.720 --> 04:04:04.339
Orlando Sequera: it add in value with our project. Right? We have to make sure. Always

2387
04:04:04.450 --> 04:04:17.050
Orlando Sequera: it's. It's a it. Keep. Keep us in check. Keep the team, keep you yourself as a Pm. That Are we adding value? We are. Are we building? Are we adding value to the organization. What we're doing this is huge.

2388
04:04:17.060 --> 04:04:34.679
Orlando Sequera: This is super super super, important for you as a project manager always ask that question as a validation to the work that is being done by the team. Are we adding value with what we're doing with the project? So it's always good to go through that check in process with value.

2389
04:04:35.680 --> 04:04:37.449
Orlando Sequera: All right, so

2390
04:04:37.680 --> 04:04:39.479
Orlando Sequera: so far we have covered.

2391
04:04:40.220 --> 04:04:46.069
Orlando Sequera: This is what we cover in this lesson. It's about monitoring value that in the scope

2392
04:04:46.540 --> 04:05:06.409
Orlando Sequera: Measure Ongoing progress based on methodology, modify the schedule as needed based on the methodology we're looking at the performance. This is where things are happening in the project. Okay, think things are being done. We'll coordinate with the products on operations. We pay attention to budget variations and we're we're governing process

2393
04:05:06.650 --> 04:05:08.360
Orlando Sequera: to adjust as needed.

2394
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:11.989
Orlando Sequera: We look at and examine the business value throughout the project.

2395
04:05:12.080 --> 04:05:18.730
Orlando Sequera: and we continually survey product deliver quality and recommend options for improvement based on quality gaps

2396
04:05:19.390 --> 04:05:21.650
Orlando Sequera: I would like to

2397
04:05:24.010 --> 04:05:25.420
Orlando Sequera: address

2398
04:05:25.900 --> 04:05:32.579
Orlando Sequera: would like to address any questions before we come break. We're gonna take a break in a few minutes, but i'm gonna take a look at

2399
04:05:32.660 --> 04:05:35.460
Orlando Sequera: the Q. And a. And address

2400
04:05:35.500 --> 04:05:37.700
Orlando Sequera: questions before we go on break

2401
04:05:44.810 --> 04:05:46.220
all right.

2402
04:05:52.230 --> 04:06:03.210
Orlando Sequera: During the exam any calculations require not can Mo. In most cases the answer is, no. But you need to know the interpretation. You need to know what those values mean.

2403
04:06:04.090 --> 04:06:06.690
Orlando Sequera: It doesn't hurt to know the formulas, but

2404
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:12.820
Orlando Sequera: in this version of the exam it's more about interpretations, more of our critical thinking.

2405
04:06:23.170 --> 04:06:29.899
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the Q. A. How does spa change. If earn value, doesn't match, plan, value.

2406
04:06:35.190 --> 04:06:42.639
Orlando Sequera: sole fire houses, and no, it's up. You build. You build. The project is to build, not to sell fire. Houses is to build

2407
04:06:42.740 --> 04:06:44.900
Orlando Sequera: 10 houses in

2408
04:06:45.860 --> 04:06:47.050
Orlando Sequera: in a year.

2409
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.850
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

2410
04:06:49.500 --> 04:06:55.810
Orlando Sequera: No, no, no, you're You're mixing a few things here. You're it's it's your You're overthinking it. A little bit.

2411
04:06:55.910 --> 04:07:02.609
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna read the question again. How does spa change? If earn value doesn't match plan value? Well, you gotta calculate

2412
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:03.989
Orlando Sequera: and value first

2413
04:07:04.290 --> 04:07:06.829
Orlando Sequera: and then calculate your plan. Value.

2414
04:07:07.530 --> 04:07:10.399
Orlando Sequera: plan values what you plan for, and value is

2415
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:29.080
Orlando Sequera: how much work has been completed. Expressed in monetary terms. You completed 4 houses, $400,000 for that particular exempt. The rest of the question says: Sold 5 houses in 6 months. No, that's not your project. Your product is not selling houses. It's building houses. That is.

2416
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:38.169
Orlando Sequera: you're mixing a few variables that are not applicable to the scenario. It pulls down. Everybody mentioned Bolst down to compare actual what happens

2417
04:07:38.430 --> 04:07:44.319
Orlando Sequera: in reality to what you plan for. That's all it is, that's all. It is nothing else.

2418
04:07:49.830 --> 04:08:00.030
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat. But if we are overspending and ahead of schedule that is in bad. If you're over we'll tell that to your stakeholder that you're over spending you spending more money. I,

2419
04:08:00.110 --> 04:08:03.389
Orlando Sequera: I am a 100% sure that they are going to disagree.

2420
04:08:04.430 --> 04:08:09.769
Orlando Sequera: If you're over spending you're in trouble. Your schedule is not in trouble, but your budget is

2421
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:14.269
Orlando Sequera: in value, isn't it bad

2422
04:08:15.100 --> 04:08:16.750
Orlando Sequera: to be either

2423
04:08:17.110 --> 04:08:19.599
Orlando Sequera: over on on their budget. No.

2424
04:08:20.180 --> 04:08:27.710
Orlando Sequera: a. If you are over budget, it means that you are over spending. If you're under budget, it means that you are

2425
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:29.510
Orlando Sequera: understanding.

2426
04:08:30.120 --> 04:08:34.560
Orlando Sequera: and that's good for your project as a Pm. Wouldn't you want to be as close

2427
04:08:34.930 --> 04:08:43.540
Orlando Sequera: to budget as possible. Yes, but there's always gonna be a variance. There's always gonna be a variance if you are under spending.

2428
04:08:43.650 --> 04:08:47.089
Orlando Sequera: if you are under. But it is good because you are getting more.

2429
04:08:47.410 --> 04:08:53.679
Orlando Sequera: You're not. You're spending less than what you said that you were going to spend. If you tell that to your stakeholders. They're going to like it

2430
04:08:57.290 --> 04:09:14.550
Orlando Sequera: if I hire someone, and every time they complete a job for me it is on their budget or completed early, I will think they are send back, and no, necessarily we're not. That is not the case here. Remember that we're using estimation techniques to be as accurate as possible. So we're not. Send back in anything here.

2431
04:09:15.040 --> 04:09:20.329
Orlando Sequera: It's just it's it's You're mixing a couple of things that are not a

2432
04:09:20.600 --> 04:09:22.110
Orlando Sequera: that are not applicable.

2433
04:09:23.920 --> 04:09:25.570
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2434
04:09:28.110 --> 04:09:30.320
Orlando Sequera: slide 61.

2435
04:09:30.350 --> 04:09:47.940
Orlando Sequera: It's confusing, because when it comes to cost variance or budget, it's fair to have a lower number to be under budget. But for efficiency to have a higher number, but it shows our budget. No, we clarified that this slide was incorrect in that, for the Cpi over budget

2436
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:52.609
Orlando Sequera: is that it goes on the on the opposite side. We already clarify that

2437
04:09:53.930 --> 04:10:02.519
Orlando Sequera: over budget is bad for cost variance, and it's also that for Cpi, if it's 0 point, something less than one.

2438
04:10:02.650 --> 04:10:09.389
Orlando Sequera: If it's less than one, for your Cpi is bad. It's over Budget, you're overspending. Okay, Make sure that you understand that

2439
04:10:14.480 --> 04:10:24.200
Orlando Sequera: it seems that to get earned value you need to understand per unit cost. Not necessarily. But you need to understand how much work have you completed express in monetary terms.

2440
04:10:27.400 --> 04:10:35.670
Orlando Sequera: What is an acceptable variance percentage between planning and execution? That's what you decide. That's what you define with the threshold

2441
04:10:35.880 --> 04:10:37.849
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna come from the organization.

2442
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:44.190
Orlando Sequera: That is part of your a opa. That's why we incorporated that to our

2443
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:45.860
Orlando Sequera: budget

2444
04:10:46.030 --> 04:10:49.050
Orlando Sequera: A to a

2445
04:10:49.130 --> 04:10:56.330
Orlando Sequera: our budget management plan and our schedule management plan. You need to understand that from the organization they're going to give you those guidelines.

2446
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:10.690
Orlando Sequera: Would you happen to have a resource that includes a diagram showing what project plans and documents are completed during each phase.

2447
04:11:14.440 --> 04:11:17.240
Orlando Sequera: You can review the resources

2448
04:11:17.680 --> 04:11:18.659
Orlando Sequera: for that.

2449
04:11:21.610 --> 04:11:25.179
Orlando Sequera: That's the Pmo. Wrangle. Q. A. Qc.

2450
04:11:25.200 --> 04:11:29.940
Orlando Sequera: You gotta get the guidelines from. They might give you some of the templates

2451
04:11:30.110 --> 04:11:41.740
Orlando Sequera: for. Or if you, if you have a quality department in the organization, get the information from that quality policy is important, and it changes from industry to industry. Organization to organization

2452
04:11:43.730 --> 04:11:46.130
Orlando Sequera: clearly makes a huge difference. Absolutely

2453
04:11:55.630 --> 04:12:06.049
Orlando Sequera: slight. 70 says, Control quality. You're saying Qc. Quality control well in in it's the same context where we have to control our quality. Right? We do that. That's Qc. Why, it we control.

2454
04:12:10.850 --> 04:12:19.169
Orlando Sequera: as you'll see. Is this the shops lifestyle center project that we're using in the as an example in our slides.

2455
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:27.740
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between Q. A. And Qc.

2456
04:12:27.900 --> 04:12:35.629
Orlando Sequera: One more time. Absolutely, Qa. Is, how well are we following the quality procedures, quality guidelines?

2457
04:12:36.290 --> 04:12:55.799
Orlando Sequera: A. The quality policy. Remember the restaurant example. Have we following the quality guidance that are needed? Are we washing our hands that we were in the her nets? Are we storing the food properly? Are we keeping all the kitchen surfaces sanitized as needed. Are we keeping the restaurant sanitized as needed?

2458
04:12:56.200 --> 04:13:00.289
Orlando Sequera: How well are we following those guidelines? That is Q. A.

2459
04:13:00.340 --> 04:13:01.050
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2460
04:13:01.380 --> 04:13:12.180
Orlando Sequera: But Qc. Is about the delivery. It's customer face, and they're deliverable right in the restaurant. It will be our the meals being served on a in a timely manner.

2461
04:13:12.650 --> 04:13:31.749
Orlando Sequera: are the tables and silver were clean, and that are the dishes clean are the meals being prepared as per the customer. Specifications like? If it's stake, is it well done? They want it well done. Are they getting well done or not? Are they getting medium rare? So that is Qc. Do? And

2462
04:13:31.760 --> 04:13:33.169
Orlando Sequera: And if you're not.

2463
04:13:33.200 --> 04:13:35.250
Orlando Sequera: align with your

2464
04:13:36.160 --> 04:13:54.000
Orlando Sequera: it with your customers. If requirements, then that will be a defect. Let's assume that a customer asks for well, don't steak, and they will serve medium rare. That will be a defect if chances are that it's gonna be sent back to the kitchen until it gets cooked, and that will be a defect and

2465
04:13:54.150 --> 04:14:03.310
Orlando Sequera: cooking the stake again. That's re-work. Right? So that's the difference. Qc. Is about a. The deliverables it themselves

2466
04:14:03.440 --> 04:14:13.190
Orlando Sequera: is customer facing Qa. Is more it is related to. How well are we following the quality, guidance, and procedures that we said that we were going to follow?

2467
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:14.859
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2468
04:14:18.960 --> 04:14:20.580
Orlando Sequera: Let me go back.

2469
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:28.060
Orlando Sequera: Who perform the quality control, audit

2470
04:14:28.600 --> 04:14:45.190
Orlando Sequera: the team, does it board order depending on the industry. You might have external entities that can do that. It changes from organization to organization, but the team does it. It's called verification. Is it also quality quality control

2471
04:14:50.840 --> 04:15:03.380
Orlando Sequera: control charts? We cover enough what we need to know for the exam. I will recommend to watch the replay. We don't need to go that deep into that. It's just a tool that allows us to understand. If if a process is out of control.

2472
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:05.879
Orlando Sequera: at what point? That's the project.

2473
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:11.960
Orlando Sequera: Do the project? Do we ask if a risk out of is needed? Usually Don't ask for that. It happens you wanna

2474
04:15:12.030 --> 04:15:14.109
Orlando Sequera: It can happen

2475
04:15:14.360 --> 04:15:16.540
Orlando Sequera: randomly, or it can happen.

2476
04:15:16.580 --> 04:15:18.140
Orlando Sequera: or it can be scheduled.

2477
04:15:19.400 --> 04:15:25.529
Orlando Sequera: How it's Risk monitoring don in agile approach. As this prints are completed, Remember what we mentioned before

2478
04:15:25.630 --> 04:15:38.390
Orlando Sequera: risks that are identified. They come. They are part of the backlog. They prioritize, prioritized by the team, and they're also incorporated to their iteration backlog, so they can be addressed as early as possible in the project.

2479
04:15:44.390 --> 04:15:48.500
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Having a hard time differentiating between product and product product it's about

2480
04:15:49.170 --> 04:15:55.900
Orlando Sequera: functionality and specification project is the work that we have to complete to produce

2481
04:15:56.350 --> 04:16:07.650
Orlando Sequera: those product requirements project work. So that is, I will recommend you to review the recordings of the session. So I think we have cover that

2482
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:12.119
Orlando Sequera: properly.

2483
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:30.130
Orlando Sequera: What triggers the risk audit Rule 7. No rule of 7 only points out that a process is out of control.

2484
04:16:34.380 --> 04:16:47.349
Orlando Sequera: You mentioned a quality management plan, but I don't see any mention of this in the slides. No. We talked about the quality management plan earlier. When we mentioned quality, we have to create a plan for every single area. So we did mention the quality management plan

2485
04:16:47.820 --> 04:16:50.750
Orlando Sequera: is this: this is part of quality. We do that in planning.

2486
04:16:57.290 --> 04:16:58.600
Orlando Sequera: If we have

2487
04:16:59.460 --> 04:17:07.699
Orlando Sequera: plus 5% negative variance, it will be call as bad planning. Not necessarily. It depends on the threshold that you have in the organization.

2488
04:17:12.770 --> 04:17:18.140
Orlando Sequera: since risk registers keeping updated will continue to be updated as well. Yes, if you start.

2489
04:17:18.230 --> 04:17:20.709
Orlando Sequera: identify more risks. Yes.

2490
04:17:23.950 --> 04:17:26.859
Orlando Sequera: what if your plan value is higher span

2491
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:29.800
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of the project?

2492
04:17:32.500 --> 04:17:38.049
Orlando Sequera: A. You is what you plan for right express in monetary value.

2493
04:17:46.430 --> 04:17:54.550
Orlando Sequera: Can you go? Can you quickly go over slide Number 84? What do you think of a risk and a project? Which one do you think of the most serious?

2494
04:17:55.230 --> 04:17:58.730
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to agree with compliance that can make a break

2495
04:17:59.170 --> 04:18:07.820
Orlando Sequera: a project, but also risk from the scale it risks associated with the main constraint of the organization. If the main constraint, the organization is

2496
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:14.610
Orlando Sequera: schedule, for example, those are are also at the top of my will be at the top of my priorities. But

2497
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:18.249
Orlando Sequera: compliance is huge that can make a break your project.

2498
04:18:20.140 --> 04:18:21.240
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2499
04:18:21.820 --> 04:18:26.539
Orlando Sequera: all right. So let's go ahead. We'll still have a couple of minutes

2500
04:18:27.210 --> 04:18:28.440
Orlando Sequera: a

2501
04:18:28.460 --> 04:18:44.389
Orlando Sequera: another question, as we, as we have seen in current times, with with Covid and inflation, is it better to add a buffer to the estimated cost in case of unforeseen circumstances, or just use current nose

2502
04:18:44.400 --> 04:18:51.290
Orlando Sequera: for a current accurate estimate. No, you can add that Buffer and that buffer has a name management reserves.

2503
04:18:51.540 --> 04:18:57.710
Orlando Sequera: but if you're able to identify them, then they are your contingency reserve. So we do that

2504
04:19:02.680 --> 04:19:09.510
Orlando Sequera: I get lost in the initial charge for a/C. Actual cost is the money that you have spent in your project.

2505
04:19:16.960 --> 04:19:19.799
Orlando Sequera: Qa: You can also look this up.

2506
04:19:20.160 --> 04:19:23.789
Orlando Sequera: It is quality, assurance of making sure that it is compliant. Yes.

2507
04:19:23.970 --> 04:19:37.250
Orlando Sequera: if you have good quality assurance, good. Qa. Translates into good Qc. Less defects, so it's better to take the time to do things the right way. Train our people in following the right guidelines.

2508
04:19:37.340 --> 04:19:52.470
Orlando Sequera: If they use specialized equipment in the kitchen, make sure that they're trained. They use how they know how to use the dishwasher machine or this washing machine they are train on. They got on the guidelines from the Health Department in watching their hands.

2509
04:19:52.500 --> 04:19:55.540
Orlando Sequera: So take the time and invest in your

2510
04:19:56.290 --> 04:19:58.110
Orlando Sequera: in your

2511
04:19:58.880 --> 04:20:02.770
Orlando Sequera: in your Qa. That's gonna translate to better. Qc.

2512
04:20:10.540 --> 04:20:19.619
Orlando Sequera: Q. A. Slightly different, depending on on the industry that you're working with Absolutely, absolutely. But the principle is the same. The application is going to be different.

2513
04:20:24.140 --> 04:20:30.679
Orlando Sequera: What happens to the unused management and continuous yourself at the end of the pretty great question. Break question if

2514
04:20:31.280 --> 04:20:32.699
Orlando Sequera: if you

2515
04:20:32.800 --> 04:20:42.469
Orlando Sequera: you can always. And we're gonna talk about that in a minute with change control process, it is possible to create a change, request, and use.

2516
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:45.539
Orlando Sequera: We have come to a point that the level of uncertainty

2517
04:20:45.790 --> 04:20:48.409
Orlando Sequera: has decreased. We haven't.

2518
04:20:48.440 --> 04:20:57.880
Orlando Sequera: identified any other risk, and we have money available in the contingency reserves and the management reserves. We can create a change request

2519
04:20:58.210 --> 04:21:04.389
Orlando Sequera: that gets routed to the change control board, and we can add that money to our, to our budget

2520
04:21:04.420 --> 04:21:09.890
Orlando Sequera: and re baseline our budget. It is possible to do that. It is possible to it happens a lot

2521
04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:10.810
Orlando Sequera: actually

2522
04:21:11.360 --> 04:21:12.869
Orlando Sequera: great question

2523
04:21:15.460 --> 04:21:22.220
Orlando Sequera: in procurement. Innovative and flexible contracts can account for the unpredictable

2524
04:21:22.270 --> 04:21:25.090
Orlando Sequera: on predictability in the suppliers

2525
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:34.739
Orlando Sequera: material labor which can alleviate risk. Yes, yes, you try to tie the type of contract to the situation, to make it as flexible as possible. That is

2526
04:21:35.470 --> 04:21:36.709
Orlando Sequera: a true statement.

2527
04:21:37.450 --> 04:21:39.090
Orlando Sequera: A

2528
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:47.310
Orlando Sequera: left over money. Get started to bonuses.

2529
04:21:47.580 --> 04:21:49.439
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily, but

2530
04:21:51.230 --> 04:21:52.050
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2531
04:21:52.090 --> 04:21:58.760
Orlando Sequera: all right. So I think we're cut up with the questions. Now we're going to take a 10 min break, and we'll be back

2532
04:21:59.430 --> 04:22:02.250
Orlando Sequera: in 10 min, and we're going to continue

2533
04:22:02.350 --> 04:22:03.400
Orlando Sequera: with our

2534
04:22:03.460 --> 04:22:04.340
Orlando Sequera: less.

2535
04:22:29.230 --> 04:22:31.709
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with our class.

2536
04:22:34.170 --> 04:22:43.119
Orlando Sequera: And the next topic that we're going to be covering is managing project issues and impediments. So we're going to be covering now.

2537
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:46.220
Orlando Sequera: and here we have.

2538
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:49.490
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be addressing

2539
04:22:51.100 --> 04:22:52.400
Orlando Sequera: a

2540
04:22:54.170 --> 04:22:57.910
Orlando Sequera: impediments, obstacles, and blockers, right

2541
04:22:58.200 --> 04:22:59.440
Orlando Sequera: mainly

2542
04:23:00.570 --> 04:23:04.829
Orlando Sequera: they the the Exam Continental, and that's why we're I mentioned this.

2543
04:23:05.320 --> 04:23:06.360
Orlando Sequera: They

2544
04:23:06.560 --> 04:23:09.059
Orlando Sequera: mentioned in the exam Content outline

2545
04:23:09.080 --> 04:23:10.379
Orlando Sequera: all 3 of them

2546
04:23:10.620 --> 04:23:14.979
Orlando Sequera: impediments, obstacles, and blockers in essence.

2547
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:17.570
Orlando Sequera: Anything that prevents

2548
04:23:17.690 --> 04:23:22.250
Orlando Sequera: your team members from doing the work. That's what is. Consider

2549
04:23:23.490 --> 04:23:34.169
Orlando Sequera: impediment, obstacle and blocker right. So impediment and blocker they are synonyms. They both mean a must to obstacle that prevents the team from achieving the the objectives right?

2550
04:23:35.380 --> 04:23:36.230
Orlando Sequera: So

2551
04:23:36.430 --> 04:23:38.280
Orlando Sequera: this is where

2552
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:44.159
Orlando Sequera: what we have to do as servant leaders, we have to help our teams

2553
04:23:44.320 --> 04:23:58.359
Orlando Sequera: to remove in removing any impediments, any obstacles, any blockers, anything that is preventing them from doing the work. That is part of Georgia as a servant leader in helping your teams

2554
04:23:58.480 --> 04:24:00.660
Orlando Sequera: it to be able to

2555
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:03.310
Orlando Sequera: complete their work.

2556
04:24:03.350 --> 04:24:04.090
Orlando Sequera: So

2557
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:12.549
Orlando Sequera: one thing that I wanted to point out you might be wondering. Can you give us some examples of that? Well, it could be that for a specific task.

2558
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:23.270
Orlando Sequera: They need a specific piece of equipment. Let's assume, for example, that we're trying to develop the software for the accounting department, and

2559
04:24:23.470 --> 04:24:24.890
Orlando Sequera: they need to

2560
04:24:25.040 --> 04:24:34.689
Orlando Sequera: the task or not. The task they they they're developing is the monthly sales report, and it has to be generated in a Pdf. Format.

2561
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:42.410
Orlando Sequera: We don't have a tool that can allow our developers to generate. Pdf. Format reports.

2562
04:24:42.600 --> 04:24:43.960
Orlando Sequera: That will be

2563
04:24:44.020 --> 04:24:45.770
Orlando Sequera: an obstacle in this case.

2564
04:24:45.820 --> 04:24:49.529
Orlando Sequera: and your job as a servant leader. If you're a team lead

2565
04:24:50.160 --> 04:24:57.839
Orlando Sequera: and the pro or the project manager. You have to help your team in members in getting that software. That is

2566
04:24:57.890 --> 04:25:02.700
Orlando Sequera: your job is part of your job to make sure that they have the tools and

2567
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:05.379
Orlando Sequera: have but another.

2568
04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:13.719
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect that another form of obstacle that might be affecting the team is

2569
04:25:13.890 --> 04:25:32.350
Orlando Sequera: something that we mentioned yesterday. We have a stakeholder that is constantly calling the team members directly asking for updates on the work that is being done, and it's affecting the team, the team members performance. It's affecting their ability to concentrate on work

2570
04:25:32.360 --> 04:25:38.030
Orlando Sequera: on the items that need to be addressed so that could be an I that's another obstacle. So in that case

2571
04:25:38.080 --> 04:25:43.319
Orlando Sequera: we have to address that obstacle that that will be communicating with your

2572
04:25:43.680 --> 04:25:44.789
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder.

2573
04:25:44.910 --> 04:25:48.629
Orlando Sequera: providing the awareness, Mr. Stakeholder, miss a stakeholder.

2574
04:25:48.990 --> 04:25:55.120
Orlando Sequera: I am your point of contact. You Would you would like to to know about the status of the project? Please

2575
04:25:55.580 --> 04:26:02.609
Orlando Sequera: feel free to contact me. That is part of my responsibility. I am the one I am the the spokesperson of the team.

2576
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:18.339
Orlando Sequera: and they'll be more than happy to provide you with information. If I don't have it available right away, i'll make sure that I get it for you. So that is also another type of auster obstacle that they might face. We are in charge of removing that. So it's tied up to

2577
04:26:18.530 --> 04:26:25.240
Orlando Sequera: serve and leadership. Make sure that you are able to keep that in mind

2578
04:26:26.200 --> 04:26:38.840
Orlando Sequera: obstacle is a it's a long term that's very common in project management. So please make sure that we are. That's what we mean with impediments, obstacles, and blockers. And that's what we have to address.

2579
04:26:38.960 --> 04:26:45.300
Orlando Sequera: We have to remove those impediments, obstacles and blockers that are preventing the team from completing the work.

2580
04:26:45.650 --> 04:26:46.560
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2581
04:26:53.330 --> 04:26:56.380
Orlando Sequera: actually, when it comes to issues

2582
04:26:58.030 --> 04:27:00.130
Orlando Sequera: going back to our

2583
04:27:00.690 --> 04:27:02.379
Orlando Sequera: definition of risk.

2584
04:27:02.440 --> 04:27:06.380
Orlando Sequera: So i'm going to ask you this question. Please feel free

2585
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:11.690
Orlando Sequera: to use the chat. I'm. Going to open up the chat for

2586
04:27:11.710 --> 04:27:13.519
Orlando Sequera: for a few seconds

2587
04:27:15.230 --> 04:27:18.259
Orlando Sequera: is our risks and issues the same.

2588
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:20.020
Orlando Sequera: What what do you think?

2589
04:27:21.080 --> 04:27:22.500
Orlando Sequera: No, correct?

2590
04:27:22.520 --> 04:27:25.569
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between issues and risks?

2591
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:39.120
Orlando Sequera: It's a materialized for it. Correct? You guys are right on track, an issue something that already happened. There's no uncertainty. It happened

2592
04:27:39.310 --> 04:27:47.889
Orlando Sequera: so exactly exactly correct. I'm gonna post the chat now. Great job, Great job. No issues happen. Risk

2593
04:27:48.160 --> 04:27:52.149
Orlando Sequera: Haven't happened. They they may or may not happen. Okay.

2594
04:27:52.390 --> 04:27:55.419
Orlando Sequera: so great job. I think the most of you got it.

2595
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:56.300
Orlando Sequera: and

2596
04:27:56.710 --> 04:28:00.889
Orlando Sequera: there's no more uncertainty when it comes to an issue.

2597
04:28:01.450 --> 04:28:05.660
Orlando Sequera: An impediment is going to be an obstacle that is preventing the team to

2598
04:28:05.890 --> 04:28:20.350
Orlando Sequera: complete their objectives. It could be lack of equipment, lack of material, lack of time. It could be an a, a, a stakeholder that is not letting them do their work. They can. They can come in many way, shapes or form. So

2599
04:28:20.450 --> 04:28:26.719
Orlando Sequera: if we're following a predictive approach we're going to, and we encounter an issue.

2600
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:30.130
Orlando Sequera: Then what we do is we have to create another

2601
04:28:30.290 --> 04:28:43.929
Orlando Sequera: register that we call the issue lock, because issues are very important. We we need to track them separately. We need that. We're gonna work in conjunction with our risk register. But we need a specific list of issues, and we call that issue log

2602
04:28:44.130 --> 04:28:53.309
Orlando Sequera: in agile projects. We have what is called an impediment lock. It's the same principle. It's just a. It's just a list of

2603
04:28:53.330 --> 04:28:58.840
Orlando Sequera: impediments that we're encountering in our project, and we're keeping track of them. Okay.

2604
04:29:00.600 --> 04:29:02.179
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2605
04:29:02.880 --> 04:29:04.709
Orlando Sequera: risks and issues

2606
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:09.469
Orlando Sequera: with risks again.

2607
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:17.279
Orlando Sequera: We're looking at the future is some is something that may or may not happen. Uncertainty, right may

2608
04:29:17.430 --> 04:29:19.070
Orlando Sequera: or may not happen.

2609
04:29:19.140 --> 04:29:21.519
Orlando Sequera: or I should probably say may not happen.

2610
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:23.440
Orlando Sequera: It happened okay.

2611
04:29:23.820 --> 04:29:29.539
Orlando Sequera: As we learn, risks can be positive or negative, and we document risks

2612
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:35.929
Orlando Sequera: in the risk register and the responses we call them risk responses.

2613
04:29:36.690 --> 04:29:37.500
Orlando Sequera: When

2614
04:29:37.770 --> 04:29:40.040
Orlando Sequera: negative risks come to fruition

2615
04:29:40.680 --> 04:29:43.119
Orlando Sequera: they become issues. Okay.

2616
04:29:43.410 --> 04:29:45.049
Orlando Sequera: they become issues.

2617
04:29:45.350 --> 04:29:52.109
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna give you an example a of a risk and an issue just the the way we face it

2618
04:29:52.530 --> 04:29:54.050
Orlando Sequera: makes it at risk

2619
04:29:54.480 --> 04:29:55.980
Orlando Sequera: or an issue

2620
04:29:56.790 --> 04:30:01.240
Orlando Sequera: as supplier might go. And i'm gonna ask you. Actually, I want to ask you.

2621
04:30:01.540 --> 04:30:03.860
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna i'm past the chat for a second.

2622
04:30:04.960 --> 04:30:09.600
Orlando Sequera: A supplier might go on strike. Is that an issue or a risk?

2623
04:30:13.560 --> 04:30:23.520
Orlando Sequera: That's a risk might go on strike might, might, might go on strike. May or may not my gone strike? That will make it a risk.

2624
04:30:23.620 --> 04:30:31.680
Orlando Sequera: But what if I would? What if I were to say a supplier has gone on strike? Is that an issue or a risk?

2625
04:30:32.810 --> 04:30:42.719
Orlando Sequera: That's our issue? Right? There's no more uncertainty. It happened. They are on strike right now. So that is the difference between a new at risk and an issue with a simple example.

2626
04:30:43.020 --> 04:30:44.160
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2627
04:30:44.770 --> 04:30:45.590
Orlando Sequera: So

2628
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:48.269
Orlando Sequera: when it comes, and i'm going to press the chat

2629
04:30:48.470 --> 04:30:50.890
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to issues.

2630
04:30:51.090 --> 04:31:03.059
Orlando Sequera: We are focused on the present. There's no more. Insert the we have to act. They're always going to be negative, because an issue is a negative risk that came to fruition, a threat.

2631
04:31:03.180 --> 04:31:15.749
Orlando Sequera: a negative risk or threat that came to fruition. They have to be documented separately in what we call issue log and their responses for issues. We call them workarounds

2632
04:31:16.370 --> 04:31:18.439
Orlando Sequera: and issues also

2633
04:31:18.620 --> 04:31:21.610
Orlando Sequera: have multiple categories, as risks.

2634
04:31:21.730 --> 04:31:26.680
Orlando Sequera: They can be related to quality communications, procurement.

2635
04:31:26.760 --> 04:31:28.369
Orlando Sequera: scope, change control.

2636
04:31:30.620 --> 04:31:35.140
Orlando Sequera: and these are multiple areas of our project. So they can come.

2637
04:31:35.190 --> 04:31:39.390
Orlando Sequera: They these are the areas. Of course, risk management

2638
04:31:39.440 --> 04:31:46.299
Orlando Sequera: schedule control cost control, project variance analysis. So these are the areas in a project that are prone to issues.

2639
04:31:47.130 --> 04:31:49.580
Orlando Sequera: If we're following a predictive approach. That is.

2640
04:31:49.860 --> 04:31:50.780
Orlando Sequera: and

2641
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:53.130
Orlando Sequera: what do we do about

2642
04:31:53.950 --> 04:31:56.100
Orlando Sequera: issue resolution?

2643
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.949
Orlando Sequera: So

2644
04:31:58.610 --> 04:32:03.570
Orlando Sequera: this is important. And this is also another component of those

2645
04:32:03.640 --> 04:32:06.129
Orlando Sequera: project status reports that I mentioned.

2646
04:32:06.460 --> 04:32:20.280
Orlando Sequera: You have to also address issues and provide status on issues. So you create your issue log. It's Another registers very similar to to the risk register. It's another spreadsheet that you're going to create just

2647
04:32:20.410 --> 04:32:24.470
Orlando Sequera: or issues negative risks that materialize

2648
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:38.040
Orlando Sequera: the same way that we do with risks. We have to assign an owner to each issue. This is the individual. The owner is the individual that is going to track that issue to completion.

2649
04:32:38.430 --> 04:32:44.019
Orlando Sequera: We should a good practices to give realistic due dates

2650
04:32:44.120 --> 04:32:45.670
Orlando Sequera: to the issues

2651
04:32:45.900 --> 04:32:47.470
Orlando Sequera: they should become

2652
04:32:47.490 --> 04:33:07.060
Orlando Sequera: at regular topic. They are. This is a this is something that happens in every organization. Issues are covered during every status meeting, and we have our job as project managers is try to keep these issues under control. The number of issues open under control. Otherwise that's a major

2653
04:33:07.400 --> 04:33:15.850
Orlando Sequera: problem for your project. We gotta keep it under control, and if we need to escalate them we cannot wait. We have to be proactive

2654
04:33:15.869 --> 04:33:26.849
Orlando Sequera: if we need someone else. Intervention to solve them, make sure that it happens in a timely manner so very similar to the risk register. But in this case we have.

2655
04:33:27.290 --> 04:33:29.739
Orlando Sequera: we can have the the

2656
04:33:30.130 --> 04:33:35.690
Orlando Sequera: the description. When we open the actual issue.

2657
04:33:35.900 --> 04:33:49.030
Orlando Sequera: they do they, but it has to be realistic. If something, if it's something complex, you shouldn't give it at the the 2 days, you know a due date. It's gonna be. We're gonna closer in 2 days, and we know right of the right. That is something complex.

2658
04:33:49.509 --> 04:34:01.139
Orlando Sequera: It is something high priority made low priority. We have to prioritize as much as possible, assign an owner. This is the individual that is responsible to track this issue to completion.

2659
04:34:01.180 --> 04:34:18.619
Orlando Sequera: They their response, and you might have TV. These if you don't know the response. But you're gonna need to work with other people to get the response. Then the status and any comments as more information becomes available. So this is gonna be part of your bread and butter as a project manager. It's important that we keep

2660
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:23.150
Orlando Sequera: this issue lock up to date at all times as well.

2661
04:34:26.119 --> 04:34:32.920
Orlando Sequera: Hey? For adjunct we can discover impairments using scrum.

2662
04:34:32.939 --> 04:34:38.829
Orlando Sequera: and the steps that we follow are that we discover the problem or cost. We try to solve it.

2663
04:34:39.000 --> 04:34:47.210
Orlando Sequera: and the scrum master is in charge as a servant leader to find the resolution with the concerned parties.

2664
04:34:47.330 --> 04:34:48.390
Orlando Sequera: It can

2665
04:34:48.500 --> 04:35:07.349
Orlando Sequera: be with dealing with conflict somewhere else in the organization or in resolution, can help your organization grow in agility. So, as a servant leader, the the team leave or scrum master is going to be in charge of helping solving impediments. That's what we do, as several leaders is we? If we are following

2666
04:35:07.360 --> 04:35:08.730
Orlando Sequera: an agile approach.

2667
04:35:09.619 --> 04:35:12.090
Orlando Sequera: A. When it comes to reviewing pediments.

2668
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:15.629
Orlando Sequera: we have to track those impediments

2669
04:35:15.900 --> 04:35:20.369
Orlando Sequera: the same that we do in predictive. We have to track ratio. So here we have to track our impediments.

2670
04:35:20.560 --> 04:35:24.009
Orlando Sequera: we might have to reprioritize

2671
04:35:24.050 --> 04:35:25.510
Orlando Sequera: our product backlog.

2672
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:30.410
Orlando Sequera: So we also have to look because we got to pay attention to possible promise, and

2673
04:35:30.860 --> 04:35:38.839
Orlando Sequera: that those to be brought up, and if they need to be addressed as part of the workload of the team in the next iteration we have to do that

2674
04:35:38.880 --> 04:35:44.090
Orlando Sequera: the daily stand-up meeting is a great way to keep

2675
04:35:44.630 --> 04:35:50.460
Orlando Sequera: deeper ourselves up to date when it comes to impediments, because

2676
04:35:50.689 --> 04:35:56.549
Orlando Sequera: what we cover in the daily stand-up meeting. We cover 3 things, and it's mainly the team members

2677
04:35:56.669 --> 04:35:57.650
Orlando Sequera: that are

2678
04:35:57.880 --> 04:35:59.909
Orlando Sequera: coordinating with each other.

2679
04:36:00.009 --> 04:36:15.520
Orlando Sequera: They are answering 3 questions. The first one is what they worked on the day before. The the second one is what they're gonna be working on today, and the third one is if they have an impediments, blockers, or obstacles that are preventing them from doing their work.

2680
04:36:15.529 --> 04:36:26.489
Orlando Sequera: So that is part of the content that is covered in the daily stand up in as servant leaders that we are. We're we're going to take that information from there.

2681
04:36:27.259 --> 04:36:30.760
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to address and remove those

2682
04:36:30.900 --> 04:36:34.030
Orlando Sequera: impediments, blockers, and obstacles.

2683
04:36:38.250 --> 04:36:39.120
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2684
04:36:45.380 --> 04:36:48.009
Orlando Sequera: And I'm: sure that this is not

2685
04:36:48.200 --> 04:36:52.119
Orlando Sequera: something new to you. I'm sure that most of you a deal

2686
04:36:52.140 --> 04:37:01.070
Orlando Sequera: have some a a risk, and also some issue a solving mechanism in place.

2687
04:37:01.419 --> 04:37:02.230
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2688
04:37:02.360 --> 04:37:05.630
Orlando Sequera: So what we have covered so far is

2689
04:37:06.050 --> 04:37:12.489
Orlando Sequera: we have talked about project issues. Now we understand clearly the definition, the difference

2690
04:37:12.509 --> 04:37:17.399
Orlando Sequera: a and also a definition of an issue. What is the difference between a risk and an issue?

2691
04:37:17.700 --> 04:37:19.040
Orlando Sequera: How can we

2692
04:37:19.099 --> 04:37:20.500
Orlando Sequera: attack the issue?

2693
04:37:20.570 --> 04:37:32.639
Orlando Sequera: A collaborative, relevant stakeholders? And then we talked about impediments, obstacles, and blockers as servant leaders. See, I want you to start seeing how that topic of several leadership comes into play

2694
04:37:33.009 --> 04:37:40.119
Orlando Sequera: throughout the entire content. So that's why I mentioned before. Look at the questions from the perspective of a servant leader.

2695
04:37:40.210 --> 04:37:49.629
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we have to help the team in removing those impediments, obstacles, or blockers, anything that is preventing them from completing the work.

2696
04:37:53.200 --> 04:37:58.379
Orlando Sequera: Now we are going to talk about changes. This topic is important

2697
04:37:58.490 --> 04:38:03.189
Orlando Sequera: also for the Pmp. Exam. Because change is going to happen.

2698
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:12.920
Orlando Sequera: Change is going to happen, but as long as we have a process in place that allows us to manage those changes, regardless of the approach. Whether it is

2699
04:38:12.960 --> 04:38:17.769
Orlando Sequera: a predictive approach or an adaptive approach, we can manage project changes.

2700
04:38:17.840 --> 04:38:24.219
Orlando Sequera: but we have to understand and acknowledge the fact that change is going to happen.

2701
04:38:24.490 --> 04:38:25.160
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2702
04:38:25.520 --> 04:38:28.099
Orlando Sequera: So everything starts with

2703
04:38:28.950 --> 04:38:32.609
Orlando Sequera: the definition of what constitutes a change in a project.

2704
04:38:32.910 --> 04:38:35.540
Orlando Sequera: We have to define that in our change minute.

2705
04:38:36.300 --> 04:38:51.450
Orlando Sequera: What is a change? Change can come from anywhere. It can be internal, from to the project. It can be external to the team put internal to the organization, or it may. He might come even from outside the organization, right

2706
04:38:51.630 --> 04:39:04.959
Orlando Sequera: from, for example, a new regulation. That's why we take into account enterprise, environmental factors, right? A change is something that changes one of the baselines that we have for our project.

2707
04:39:05.080 --> 04:39:14.059
Orlando Sequera: and also the project attitude towards change is going to depend on the life cycle that we chose. Whether we go agile or whether we go

2708
04:39:14.950 --> 04:39:16.490
Orlando Sequera: a predictive.

2709
04:39:17.700 --> 04:39:18.750
Orlando Sequera: they have

2710
04:39:19.250 --> 04:39:24.030
Orlando Sequera: both approaches, have different ways to manage change, but they still manage

2711
04:39:24.210 --> 04:39:30.220
Orlando Sequera: That we still have an approach to manage changes. To change is is always going to happen. Okay.

2712
04:39:32.210 --> 04:39:35.360
Orlando Sequera: what can cost a change in a project.

2713
04:39:35.669 --> 04:39:37.520
Orlando Sequera: The first one is.

2714
04:39:38.980 --> 04:39:43.869
Orlando Sequera: we might have inaccurate initial estimates that might happen.

2715
04:39:44.560 --> 04:39:49.350
Orlando Sequera: Remember that an estimate is nothing but an approximation.

2716
04:39:49.440 --> 04:40:02.739
Orlando Sequera: And if we have team members that are not really experience, or they don't have all the information. That's why we work at the beginning of our project in gathering all those opa's organization process assets.

2717
04:40:03.290 --> 04:40:15.509
Orlando Sequera: I I'll also make sure that we understand all the Aefs enterprise and marital factors that can help us in, and we validate our assumptions. And I'm talking full predictive right now

2718
04:40:16.090 --> 04:40:18.440
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that we can come up with

2719
04:40:19.170 --> 04:40:24.780
Orlando Sequera: our estimates as accurately as possible. Okay. But still things change.

2720
04:40:24.840 --> 04:40:26.740
Orlando Sequera: and it is possible that

2721
04:40:26.930 --> 04:40:27.880
Orlando Sequera: we

2722
04:40:28.170 --> 04:40:37.650
Orlando Sequera: didn't have all the information, and we might have some inaccurate initial estimates, and that is going to drive changes in your project, or that

2723
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:41.789
Orlando Sequera: there was a change in the specifications of your project.

2724
04:40:42.520 --> 04:40:46.200
Orlando Sequera: A. That also happens as a change in scope

2725
04:40:46.290 --> 04:40:53.829
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna drive a change in your project, or that we missed requirements that can happen, too.

2726
04:40:54.560 --> 04:40:57.189
Orlando Sequera: Remember that when we were

2727
04:40:57.260 --> 04:41:01.119
Orlando Sequera: early in the projects we use multiple techniques

2728
04:41:01.300 --> 04:41:03.050
Orlando Sequera: for requirement gathering.

2729
04:41:03.070 --> 04:41:10.439
Orlando Sequera: But we might miss some requirements that happens all the time, and that's gonna drive changes to the project.

2730
04:41:11.260 --> 04:41:19.629
Orlando Sequera: or that we have new regulations. That's an ef right they were. There are new regulations that in our industry, and we have

2731
04:41:19.840 --> 04:41:24.570
Orlando Sequera: to implement those regulations, it goes back to compliance. Right?

2732
04:41:24.690 --> 04:41:25.380
Orlando Sequera: So

2733
04:41:25.920 --> 04:41:32.149
Orlando Sequera: we have to make changes to approach. So change can come from pretty much anywhere, anywhere.

2734
04:41:32.400 --> 04:41:33.100
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

2735
04:41:34.220 --> 04:41:35.310
Orlando Sequera: And

2736
04:41:36.630 --> 04:41:37.780
Orlando Sequera: what about

2737
04:41:38.300 --> 04:41:42.780
Orlando Sequera: changes in an agile project? What do you think is the main

2738
04:41:42.910 --> 04:41:44.610
Orlando Sequera: source for changes.

2739
04:41:44.890 --> 04:41:45.820
Orlando Sequera: Their project?

2740
04:41:45.860 --> 04:41:47.109
Orlando Sequera: I'm: going to open up the

2741
04:41:50.440 --> 04:41:52.340
Orlando Sequera: based on what we have said. So far

2742
04:41:57.970 --> 04:42:00.320
Orlando Sequera: requirements

2743
04:42:01.280 --> 04:42:07.580
Orlando Sequera: could be. Yeah, it could be the stakeholders right mainly the stakeholders. It could be from anywhere as well.

2744
04:42:07.980 --> 04:42:09.330
Orlando Sequera: Exactly. So

2745
04:42:09.530 --> 04:42:12.609
Orlando Sequera: you guys are getting it. Stakeholder changes correct

2746
04:42:13.080 --> 04:42:14.710
Orlando Sequera: again. I'm gonna post the chat

2747
04:42:15.460 --> 04:42:25.630
Orlando Sequera: so great great job it can basically come from anywhere to. So, regardless of the approach it changes can come from anywhere, but it's going to be mainly the stakeholders. It could also be in your regulations.

2748
04:42:25.790 --> 04:42:29.679
Orlando Sequera: It it could also be that we miss some requirements, too, so it can.

2749
04:42:29.870 --> 04:42:32.860
Orlando Sequera: It can come from anywhere bottom line. Okay.

2750
04:42:34.380 --> 04:42:35.400
Orlando Sequera: And

2751
04:42:40.180 --> 04:42:42.250
Orlando Sequera: when when we look at

2752
04:42:42.440 --> 04:42:45.219
Orlando Sequera: going back to the project management principles

2753
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:51.950
Orlando Sequera: which one here, do you think i'm gonna give you a few seconds to read.

2754
04:42:52.210 --> 04:42:55.859
Orlando Sequera: Which of these project management principles deals with change

2755
04:43:01.680 --> 04:43:04.020
Orlando Sequera: what i'm and i'm going to open up the chat.

2756
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:21.729
Orlando Sequera: I see that a lot of you are saying all that is correct, but

2757
04:43:22.570 --> 04:43:34.950
Orlando Sequera: some of them it depends on your organization, so there's no right or wrong Answer. Some of this can be applicable. All of them can be applicable, but absolutely absolutely. This is there's no right or run Answer.

2758
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.890
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2759
04:43:36.840 --> 04:43:39.349
Orlando Sequera: so great great job, i'm gonna post the chat.

2760
04:43:39.880 --> 04:43:40.760
Orlando Sequera: and

2761
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:43.699
Orlando Sequera: being a diligent, respectful, or caring store.

2762
04:43:44.260 --> 04:43:52.740
Orlando Sequera: can be related to change, recognize evaluated response to system interactions definitely navigate complexity. Complexity drives changes

2763
04:43:52.920 --> 04:43:54.809
Orlando Sequera: they must related to your behaviors.

2764
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:56.350
Orlando Sequera: Creator.

2765
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:57.650
Orlando Sequera: Theme, environment.

2766
04:43:57.780 --> 04:44:04.489
Orlando Sequera: optimize, risk responses. So in essence you can definitely say that all of them can be related to

2767
04:44:04.730 --> 04:44:08.990
Orlando Sequera: change. So the point that we're trying to make here is that

2768
04:44:09.200 --> 04:44:14.020
Orlando Sequera: change is going to happen. The principles are there to remind you of that.

2769
04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:18.589
Orlando Sequera: and we have to be able to address changes in the project.

2770
04:44:19.280 --> 04:44:22.220
Orlando Sequera: We also have to be able to monitor.

2771
04:44:23.970 --> 04:44:31.890
Orlando Sequera: pay attention to the external business environment. As I mentioned before changes can come from outside the organization.

2772
04:44:32.000 --> 04:44:35.910
Orlando Sequera: Eef: this is another reformation. Why do we have

2773
04:44:35.980 --> 04:44:37.620
Orlando Sequera: to take into account

2774
04:44:37.680 --> 04:44:41.309
Orlando Sequera: external enterprise, environmental factors? Because

2775
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:42.790
Orlando Sequera: things change

2776
04:44:42.840 --> 04:44:44.050
Orlando Sequera: in the

2777
04:44:44.210 --> 04:44:53.210
Orlando Sequera: business environment that might have an impact in our project and in the form of a change. Okay, so we gotta pay attention to that.

2778
04:44:53.280 --> 04:44:56.519
Orlando Sequera: Going back to what I mentioned before. If there is a merge.

2779
04:44:56.770 --> 04:45:01.330
Orlando Sequera: a or an acquisition of another organization by our own organization

2780
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:02.150
Orlando Sequera: that

2781
04:45:02.620 --> 04:45:06.000
Orlando Sequera: most likely it's gonna drive changes to our project

2782
04:45:06.660 --> 04:45:07.760
Orlando Sequera: any

2783
04:45:07.890 --> 04:45:18.180
Orlando Sequera: changes in the marketplace and the economic condition in the industry. So we always have to be vigilant, so it's about changes, and Also, it's related to risk right. So we have

2784
04:45:18.200 --> 04:45:24.100
Orlando Sequera: that a risk identification, mentality. What if

2785
04:45:24.580 --> 04:45:36.799
Orlando Sequera: mentality also paying attention to changes in the environment and let's use the tools. Let's classify those. There are ways that we can classify those different

2786
04:45:37.700 --> 04:45:49.129
Orlando Sequera: sources of changes the same way that we use pestle decomposition to classify risks. We can use this from list to classify

2787
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:54.030
Orlando Sequera: those enterprise environmental factors, and make sure that we address them. Okay.

2788
04:45:54.490 --> 04:45:55.130
Orlando Sequera: So

2789
04:45:55.260 --> 04:46:02.380
Orlando Sequera: pay attention to your surroundings and even and what's happening even in the environment of the organization that is really important

2790
04:46:03.690 --> 04:46:06.070
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to managing changes.

2791
04:46:07.690 --> 04:46:12.480
Orlando Sequera: If we are following a predictive approach.

2792
04:46:12.780 --> 04:46:17.800
Orlando Sequera: change is manage using a an integrated control

2793
04:46:18.090 --> 04:46:19.870
Orlando Sequera: change control process.

2794
04:46:19.920 --> 04:46:22.039
Orlando Sequera: If we're using one more time.

2795
04:46:22.660 --> 04:46:25.740
Orlando Sequera: If we're following a predictive approach in our project.

2796
04:46:25.870 --> 04:46:28.800
Orlando Sequera: predictive waterfall or traditional.

2797
04:46:28.940 --> 04:46:35.390
Orlando Sequera: we manage changes following an integrated change control process. Okay.

2798
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:44.280
Orlando Sequera: what are the controls that we have in that integrated change control process? We have, we start with creating a change request.

2799
04:46:45.340 --> 04:46:49.589
Orlando Sequera: We have a change control board that is going to evaluate

2800
04:46:49.640 --> 04:46:59.759
Orlando Sequera: those change requests, and it's gonna make a determination. And then we're also keeping track of changes to artifacts and documents. That's how we do it in

2801
04:47:00.290 --> 04:47:09.809
Orlando Sequera: predictive. But if we are following an agile approach, it's a little bit different at the end of each iteration. We're going to keep track of

2802
04:47:10.030 --> 04:47:20.630
Orlando Sequera: changes. We're gonna reprioritize the per backlog with the product owner. Make sure that that gets done, and that's how we're going to be able to address

2803
04:47:20.970 --> 04:47:22.949
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that

2804
04:47:23.120 --> 04:47:27.869
Orlando Sequera: the functionality that adds the most value to our customer is always at the top.

2805
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:31.749
Orlando Sequera: And in the demos we're going that we have

2806
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:41.790
Orlando Sequera: during the iteration of Spring Review. At the end of it. Iteration, we're going to be getting feedback, and we're going to be performing scope validation with our

2807
04:47:42.010 --> 04:48:00.920
Orlando Sequera: with our customers, with our stakeholders. And we're gonna get feedback from them. And that's also how we manage changes, because in some cases they're going to ask us to make changes to what is to what was done, and that means that that user story has to go back to the per backlog to be addressed

2808
04:48:00.970 --> 04:48:03.040
Orlando Sequera: at a later time. Okay.

2809
04:48:03.550 --> 04:48:07.739
Orlando Sequera: a it. The key aspect is going to be to work with the product owner.

2810
04:48:07.890 --> 04:48:09.880
Orlando Sequera: everyone, the team.

2811
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:28.570
Orlando Sequera: the scrum master team members from master and a project manager. If it's if we're working with a project manager, and of course the part owner should be part of that process of backlog refinement, because remember that in agile the scope is changing. This copy is not fixed as it is in predictive.

2812
04:48:28.960 --> 04:48:34.180
Orlando Sequera: but we still have a way to address and manage changes

2813
04:48:36.430 --> 04:48:38.440
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2814
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:43.320
Orlando Sequera: they change control process. This is for predictive.

2815
04:48:44.040 --> 04:48:46.929
Orlando Sequera: This is kind of this is the flow chart

2816
04:48:47.250 --> 04:48:48.780
Orlando Sequera: that is applicable

2817
04:48:48.850 --> 04:48:54.010
Orlando Sequera: to change request. This is the actual representation of the

2818
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:57.629
Orlando Sequera: integrated change control process for predictive.

2819
04:48:57.660 --> 04:49:00.859
Orlando Sequera: Okay, everything starts with

2820
04:49:00.960 --> 04:49:17.230
Orlando Sequera: creating. We're gonna follow the flow chart. Everything everything starts whenever there is a possible change. I'm going to go back to some of the questions that some of you asked before, what is the budget changes? What if there is a what if

2821
04:49:17.280 --> 04:49:35.230
Orlando Sequera: changes in the environment? The materials are the prices are higher. If for construction we have to. That's going to have an impact on our project. This is how we address those changes. That's okay. But everything starts, or let's assume that we have it. There's a major

2822
04:49:35.240 --> 04:49:41.730
Orlando Sequera: anything that could change, or there's a new regulation that it's gonna have an impact on the project. How do we address it?

2823
04:49:41.920 --> 04:49:46.230
Orlando Sequera: Any change, any possible change to a project?

2824
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:51.099
Orlando Sequera: Remember, this is for predictive. Okay, everything starts with

2825
04:49:51.180 --> 04:49:53.399
Orlando Sequera: creating a change request

2826
04:49:54.020 --> 04:49:57.309
Orlando Sequera: we have, we have a change, request form.

2827
04:49:57.640 --> 04:50:00.059
Orlando Sequera: Then we log that change, request

2828
04:50:00.790 --> 04:50:06.639
Orlando Sequera: the change request. If it passes, the filter is basically in this filter. What happens is

2829
04:50:06.870 --> 04:50:14.910
Orlando Sequera: the change is gonna get value. There. Is this really a change or not? And where do you think that gets defined? Where do we define

2830
04:50:15.000 --> 04:50:16.480
Orlando Sequera: what is a change.

2831
04:50:17.660 --> 04:50:24.079
Orlando Sequera: Remember those multiple things that we have to create for multiple areas. I'm gonna open up the chat for a second.

2832
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:27.800
Orlando Sequera: Where do we define that

2833
04:50:29.310 --> 04:50:30.540
Orlando Sequera: in in

2834
04:50:32.840 --> 04:50:43.100
Orlando Sequera: in the Change management plan, correct in one of the plans that's going to define what is a change gonna be there? That's why we create those plans. The change management plan

2835
04:50:43.770 --> 04:50:44.490
Orlando Sequera: Correct.

2836
04:50:45.050 --> 04:50:47.520
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Going to post the chat one more time.

2837
04:50:48.260 --> 04:50:51.310
Orlando Sequera: So it's defining the plan. That's why we create the plans

2838
04:50:51.640 --> 04:50:55.100
Orlando Sequera: to those are the rules of engagement in this case for

2839
04:50:55.430 --> 04:51:10.650
Orlando Sequera: changes. Okay, we create the plans. So we know. Oh, what is the change? You can be asking that question at this point, when you are already working on your project, the happening planning, we define, what is it? What is the change that was defined, you know, change management plan. So press is a filter.

2840
04:51:10.880 --> 04:51:13.090
Orlando Sequera: If it's accepted, then

2841
04:51:13.640 --> 04:51:20.070
Orlando Sequera: next step is our deliverables affected right. We are looking at impact on the project.

2842
04:51:20.320 --> 04:51:24.059
Orlando Sequera: and if the answer is no, then usually it gets rejected.

2843
04:51:24.480 --> 04:51:31.670
Orlando Sequera: But if that deliverable, the scope is effective. In this case, the answer is. Yes, then we gotta take a look at

2844
04:51:31.800 --> 04:51:36.430
Orlando Sequera: the impact. The impact has to be reviewed, and this is usually how it's done.

2845
04:51:36.550 --> 04:51:47.129
Orlando Sequera: If it's a minor impact. And this is again also they find what is a minor impact. What is the mother impact? What is the major impact that is defined again in the Change management plan.

2846
04:51:47.330 --> 04:51:54.800
Orlando Sequera: but in this prefer the impact statement. If it's minor, it's usually the Pm. That can prefer the impact statement.

2847
04:51:55.920 --> 04:51:57.920
Orlando Sequera: If it's a moderate impact.

2848
04:51:58.200 --> 04:52:00.600
Orlando Sequera: Then it's gonna be the Pm. And

2849
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:03.480
Orlando Sequera: in in conjunction with the stakeholders.

2850
04:52:04.080 --> 04:52:07.230
Orlando Sequera: If it's a major impact, you're gonna get

2851
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:17.010
Orlando Sequera: everyone you're gonna get experts subject matter experts. You're gonna get stakeholders. Review the the Pm. Of course it's gonna be in that in that.

2852
04:52:17.980 --> 04:52:24.190
Orlando Sequera: in those conversations as well in that impact analysis, if it's, if it's a major impact, the thresholds

2853
04:52:24.240 --> 04:52:34.299
Orlando Sequera: that are going to be that are going to determine. What is a minor impact? What is the motor impact. What is the major impact? Again, All of that is defined in the Change Management plan. Okay.

2854
04:52:34.640 --> 04:52:35.520
Orlando Sequera: And

2855
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:38.430
Orlando Sequera: there there is going to be a review

2856
04:52:38.700 --> 04:52:42.159
Orlando Sequera: impact and they change control board.

2857
04:52:43.320 --> 04:52:48.440
Orlando Sequera: Right here. The Change Controller Board, which is going to be formed by

2858
04:52:48.560 --> 04:52:51.709
Orlando Sequera: these stakeholders sub their matter experts.

2859
04:52:52.330 --> 04:52:54.180
Orlando Sequera: They're going to review

2860
04:52:54.480 --> 04:52:55.690
Orlando Sequera: the impact

2861
04:52:55.840 --> 04:52:57.060
Orlando Sequera: analysis

2862
04:52:57.370 --> 04:53:04.450
Orlando Sequera: impact on what impact on the budget impact on the schedule impact on the quality impact on any area

2863
04:53:04.600 --> 04:53:10.769
Orlando Sequera: of the project. They're going to review that, and they're going to make a determination. They're going to either

2864
04:53:11.010 --> 04:53:12.180
Orlando Sequera: approve

2865
04:53:12.580 --> 04:53:14.290
Orlando Sequera: the change request.

2866
04:53:14.520 --> 04:53:17.900
Orlando Sequera: and if that happens, the change gets authorized.

2867
04:53:18.040 --> 04:53:21.270
Orlando Sequera: That means that the change has to be implemented.

2868
04:53:21.410 --> 04:53:24.949
Orlando Sequera: Okay, the change has to be built in

2869
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:32.079
Orlando Sequera: our baseline, depending on what the change is. If we're adding scope to the project. Then we have to add that to our

2870
04:53:33.140 --> 04:53:41.140
Orlando Sequera: scope, baseline, because when we have to re baseline the project, and if it has also an impact on the budget on the timeline.

2871
04:53:41.170 --> 04:53:42.530
Orlando Sequera: We have to

2872
04:53:42.790 --> 04:53:46.429
Orlando Sequera: incorporate the change to the broader and to the timeline as well.

2873
04:53:46.810 --> 04:53:52.270
Orlando Sequera: and re baseline our project and re baseline, our timeline, our schedule.

2874
04:53:52.390 --> 04:54:03.140
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and we have to execute the change and rebalance the project that's what I meant by re-balancing the project that's what we mean by rebalancing the project. Okay.

2875
04:54:03.200 --> 04:54:07.959
Orlando Sequera: if the change doesn't get authorized, the Change Control Board says, No.

2876
04:54:07.980 --> 04:54:09.700
Orlando Sequera: that's the end of life

2877
04:54:09.770 --> 04:54:12.909
Orlando Sequera: for that change. And at that particular moment.

2878
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:18.159
Orlando Sequera: and then they, their whomever send the change request. They're going to get a rejection. Notice

2879
04:54:18.210 --> 04:54:23.720
Orlando Sequera: that is, in essence, how the change control process works. Okay.

2880
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:28.109
Orlando Sequera: this is a true statement. I can tell you that for the last.

2881
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:36.149
Orlando Sequera: during my time at the Artemis one program for the last year and a half I was working mainly projects

2882
04:54:36.430 --> 04:54:40.489
Orlando Sequera: that we're dealing with a. There were changes to the software

2883
04:54:41.210 --> 04:54:44.129
Orlando Sequera: that we were implementing. And I was going

2884
04:54:45.580 --> 04:54:55.959
Orlando Sequera: Yeah, at some point in time, a on a weekly basis to change control board, to present, create a change request going through exactly this same process.

2885
04:54:56.000 --> 04:55:14.639
Orlando Sequera: And this is how it works in real life. The Change Control Board evaluates and evaluate the impact on the on the project and then impact on the scheduled impact on the budget the impact on the on the scope, and they make the determination, and if it gets approved we have to implement the change.

2886
04:55:14.650 --> 04:55:17.220
Orlando Sequera: The teams have to go ahead and implement the changes.

2887
04:55:17.380 --> 04:55:20.069
Orlando Sequera: That's that's what I mean by executing the change.

2888
04:55:20.100 --> 04:55:21.769
Orlando Sequera: and we have to

2889
04:55:21.790 --> 04:55:31.140
Orlando Sequera: change for the re re baseline our projects. So this is a true representation of what happens in real life. That's how we do it in predictive.

2890
04:55:31.470 --> 04:55:33.050
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to

2891
04:55:35.730 --> 04:55:40.089
Orlando Sequera: change request. We have mainly 4 types. Okay.

2892
04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:42.140
Orlando Sequera: we have.

2893
04:55:42.740 --> 04:55:58.879
Orlando Sequera: if we are able to determine that when we are monitoring the performance of our project, that our project is not performing according to plan and we are, and the variance is above the threshold. That's why we use on value management right to determine the level of variance.

2894
04:55:59.050 --> 04:56:09.439
Orlando Sequera: If we are about the the threshold that is allowed. We have to bring our performance back and track, and for that we need to create a corrective action.

2895
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:17.730
Orlando Sequera: That means that we have it's a change, and it's going to allow us to bring our performance back in track with what we plan for.

2896
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:19.870
Orlando Sequera: hey? That's a corrective action.

2897
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:22.700
Orlando Sequera: But if, on the other hand.

2898
04:56:22.810 --> 04:56:34.210
Orlando Sequera: we start seeing by using forecasting tools like Eac, for example, we see that if we keep down we we keep going going down this path we are going to end up

2899
04:56:34.220 --> 04:56:45.950
Orlando Sequera: over Budget significantly. We can prevent that accident from happening, for that we can create a preventive action. So we can, for example, adjust, and

2900
04:56:46.160 --> 04:56:47.280
Orlando Sequera: a

2901
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:52.870
Orlando Sequera: the rate of spending our Cpi. There is currently 0 point 7, 6.

2902
04:56:53.010 --> 04:57:00.980
Orlando Sequera: That that is a horrendous for a project to bring that back on track. So we avoid an accident from happening. Okay.

2903
04:57:01.840 --> 04:57:02.840
Orlando Sequera: or

2904
04:57:02.870 --> 04:57:19.780
Orlando Sequera: we have another type of the change request, which is a different repair. If we we have a non-conformance that has been identified in the deliberables in many of the deliberals of the project, then we can fix that that will be a different repair or a change

2905
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:29.439
Orlando Sequera: to a document or a change to a baseline change to documentation. That's another type of change request. So we have mainly 4 types of change request

2906
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:32.050
Orlando Sequera: the change Control board

2907
04:57:32.950 --> 04:57:36.470
Orlando Sequera: that important entity that is going to review.

2908
04:57:36.600 --> 04:57:46.809
Orlando Sequera: They are going to analyze the impact, and they're the ones that are going to be authorizing those changes. They're going to either authorize, approved, or reject those changes.

2909
04:57:46.920 --> 04:57:47.940
Orlando Sequera: They

2910
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:49.720
Orlando Sequera: usually deal with

2911
04:57:50.120 --> 04:57:53.900
Orlando Sequera: a medium impact on high

2912
04:57:54.200 --> 04:57:57.650
Orlando Sequera: to the changes to the project. And they're going.

2913
04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:59.739
Orlando Sequera: based on what?

2914
04:57:59.950 --> 04:58:18.880
Orlando Sequera: On the impact to the budget based on the impact to the schedule based on the impact to the scope of your project. They're going to make that determination. And who forms usually the Change Control board. You have subject matter experts. You have upper management Sponsors can be part of the the

2915
04:58:19.630 --> 04:58:25.769
Orlando Sequera: A change control board as well, and you have a decision-makers basically opera management

2916
04:58:25.850 --> 04:58:49.160
Orlando Sequera: experts, decision makers. People have that have enough authority to make an information. Yes, we're gonna implement the change. And they that means that your your budget is gonna change your schedule. It's gonna be extended or reduced or shortened, etc. They can people that have enough of 30 to make the determination, and people that have enough knowledge expertise to understand the nature of the changes.

2917
04:58:50.520 --> 04:58:51.530
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2918
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:53.700
Orlando Sequera: We also have

2919
04:58:53.740 --> 04:58:55.629
Orlando Sequera: to work with managing

2920
04:58:55.840 --> 04:59:03.840
Orlando Sequera: changes for our contracts as well. Our contracts are also gonna be changing. We have to work with our vendors to manage contract changes.

2921
04:59:04.000 --> 04:59:04.920
Orlando Sequera: and

2922
04:59:05.370 --> 04:59:07.789
Orlando Sequera: we also have to work with the organization

2923
04:59:08.040 --> 04:59:10.899
Orlando Sequera: A with procurement, with legal department

2924
04:59:11.000 --> 04:59:16.480
Orlando Sequera: to also make sure that changes are being tracked. There are 2 ways that we can do that

2925
04:59:16.760 --> 04:59:19.420
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to tracking changes for

2926
04:59:19.790 --> 04:59:21.350
Orlando Sequera: our contracts.

2927
04:59:21.380 --> 04:59:35.109
Orlando Sequera: We can have a specific contract change control system, or we can use the same integrated change control process to to also track contract changes either way. But we have to be

2928
04:59:35.160 --> 04:59:54.100
Orlando Sequera: able to track changes for that are that are applied to our contract. That might happen. Okay, it's really important. Remember that these are legally binding agreements that we have with external organizations and with vendors or suppliers or

2929
04:59:54.690 --> 04:59:55.730
Orlando Sequera: sellers

2930
04:59:55.790 --> 05:00:00.069
Orlando Sequera: that we need to track the changes of those contracts as well.

2931
05:00:00.130 --> 05:00:09.689
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's important. You can do it independently, or you can use the same integrated change control system that you have in place to track other changes for your project

2932
05:00:10.320 --> 05:00:13.999
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to contract changes. What we really mean is

2933
05:00:14.520 --> 05:00:17.980
Orlando Sequera: multiple types of changes. We have administrative changes.

2934
05:00:18.260 --> 05:00:20.199
Orlando Sequera: These are these are not.

2935
05:00:20.250 --> 05:00:23.779
Orlando Sequera: is basically how the administration of the contract is done.

2936
05:00:23.920 --> 05:00:33.479
Orlando Sequera: Do you might have contract modification, Those those could be substantial changes, and they might need to be reviewed by the legal department.

2937
05:00:33.630 --> 05:00:36.640
Orlando Sequera: for example, maybe supplemental agreements.

2938
05:00:36.810 --> 05:00:52.260
Orlando Sequera: It might be an additional agreement and a and a random to the contract a that can be probably negotiated separately. So that's another type of change, and we get established who has the authority to approve these changes? Who need to be? Who needs to be involved in this process.

2939
05:00:52.270 --> 05:01:10.560
Orlando Sequera: In these processes it's usually procurement and legal department. They have to be part of that process. You might have constructive changes changes made by the buyer through action or inaction, or they may termination of the contract. This is a. When the vendor default or or buyers needs

2940
05:01:10.610 --> 05:01:13.279
Orlando Sequera: changes. Okay, multiple changes

2941
05:01:13.320 --> 05:01:16.789
Orlando Sequera: that can come into play when it comes to contracts.

2942
05:01:18.100 --> 05:01:27.879
Orlando Sequera: A few legal concepts that are important to at least have an idea. Remember that we're working with the experts in this field with a legal department, right?

2943
05:01:28.220 --> 05:01:41.130
Orlando Sequera: A project management. Neither project management nor the program from Institute expects that you are that you need to be a legal expert in order to be a a project manager. That's not the case. But we need to have

2944
05:01:41.320 --> 05:01:45.010
Orlando Sequera: some level of understanding of some

2945
05:01:45.220 --> 05:02:03.860
Orlando Sequera: common terminology that is applied in this contract, for example, a warranty. We need to know that it One of warrant is promise, whether it's a place it or implied that the good or services are going to meet a pretty depending standard waiver, which is giving away. It's a legal provision in which

2946
05:02:03.870 --> 05:02:14.580
Orlando Sequera: one party they for free to claim without the other party becoming liable. We gotta be careful with those we have to be careful with those waivers. You might inadvertently

2947
05:02:15.200 --> 05:02:18.850
Orlando Sequera: execute a waiver, and that that's that's not an excuse.

2948
05:02:18.890 --> 05:02:21.999
Orlando Sequera: So that's why we work with our

2949
05:02:22.110 --> 05:02:37.550
Orlando Sequera: legal experts that can help us to avoid those situations. A breach of contract. That's another one failure to meet some obligations in the contract, Remember, obligations are for the seller, and also for the buyer, and there's another

2950
05:02:37.560 --> 05:02:48.180
Orlando Sequera: legal terminology, legal term season. This is letter. This is like this is a letter that is sent to individuals or businesses to ask them to stop

2951
05:02:48.240 --> 05:02:53.859
Orlando Sequera: illegal activities. Otherwise legal action is going to be taken against them.

2952
05:02:54.130 --> 05:02:56.829
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so just to know what it is.

2953
05:03:00.480 --> 05:03:02.990
Orlando Sequera: we also have

2954
05:03:03.340 --> 05:03:06.939
Orlando Sequera: something important. When we're working with

2955
05:03:07.360 --> 05:03:10.030
Orlando Sequera: project we with contracts.

2956
05:03:10.210 --> 05:03:13.370
Orlando Sequera: we might have this agreements. This can happen

2957
05:03:13.710 --> 05:03:16.340
Orlando Sequera: in any project we might have these agreements

2958
05:03:16.360 --> 05:03:20.550
Orlando Sequera: between the behind organization, you and

2959
05:03:20.660 --> 05:03:27.319
Orlando Sequera: the and a vendor, we might have a disagreement they might consider. No, we fulfill our obligation and do my feel that

2960
05:03:27.400 --> 05:03:32.289
Orlando Sequera: it's not the case that happens all the time. So there is a process that is called

2961
05:03:32.320 --> 05:03:37.379
Orlando Sequera: Claims administration that is designed to assist in settling

2962
05:03:37.450 --> 05:03:40.460
Orlando Sequera: contract disputes. Disputes might happen.

2963
05:03:40.480 --> 05:03:41.140
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2964
05:03:42.380 --> 05:03:43.440
Orlando Sequera: A.

2965
05:03:43.840 --> 05:03:52.660
Orlando Sequera: This covers the processing, educating, deciding any community, and communicating any claims that are made against the contract.

2966
05:03:52.870 --> 05:04:02.650
Orlando Sequera: they can be the result of changes that are being contested. The disagreement could be the result of the 2 parties being unable to agree on the compensation to cover

2967
05:04:02.710 --> 05:04:17.859
Orlando Sequera: the charge, and if they can come they cannot come to an agreement, they can use what is called an alternative dispute resolution that is going to be specified in the contract itself and ideally

2968
05:04:18.340 --> 05:04:19.620
Orlando Sequera: settlement.

2969
05:04:19.880 --> 05:04:21.060
Orlando Sequera: if they

2970
05:04:21.520 --> 05:04:33.590
Orlando Sequera: so through negotiation is the preferred way rather than going than going through litigation. One thing that i'm going to point out for the first time today, and we're going to revisit that when we get to

2971
05:04:33.680 --> 05:04:35.670
Orlando Sequera: procurement is that

2972
05:04:35.980 --> 05:04:37.000
Orlando Sequera: Amy

2973
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:49.369
Orlando Sequera: claims in your project you have to close all your procurements, all your procurements. Let's assume for a minute that your there is a contract with supplier a.

2974
05:04:49.520 --> 05:05:02.060
Orlando Sequera: and there is a dispute, and you went through this process of escalation negotiation didn't work. They still feel that they met the obligation, and you feel that they didn't there's a dispute. We went through

2975
05:05:02.760 --> 05:05:20.880
Orlando Sequera: a negotiation process that didn't work. We escalated that to an alternative dispute resolution with a mediator that didn't work. So the dispute is still there. But we have to close the procurement always for projects.

2976
05:05:21.080 --> 05:05:22.810
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to ask you this question.

2977
05:05:22.930 --> 05:05:25.420
Orlando Sequera: Can you? And I'm gonna open up the chat.

2978
05:05:25.450 --> 05:05:27.120
Orlando Sequera: Can you close?

2979
05:05:27.800 --> 05:05:31.330
Orlando Sequera: This dispute has to go to litigation?

2980
05:05:31.980 --> 05:05:38.769
Orlando Sequera: Unfortunately, there's no other chance Can I close that procurement in my project, or do I have to keep it open?

2981
05:05:40.410 --> 05:05:43.900
Orlando Sequera: Can I close that procurement in my project, and the chat is.

2982
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:46.120
Orlando Sequera: the chat is open.

2983
05:05:54.320 --> 05:05:57.029
Orlando Sequera: Okay? I'm gonna pause the chat for a second.

2984
05:06:02.360 --> 05:06:05.180
Orlando Sequera: Most of you are saying, Leave it open, but

2985
05:06:05.960 --> 05:06:10.690
Orlando Sequera: i'm not familiar with other countries, but at least here in the States.

2986
05:06:11.480 --> 05:06:19.920
Orlando Sequera: Well, maybe in some other countries, but I think it's pretty much the same. I don't know how it is in your country. But whenever we go to litigation that can take years

2987
05:06:20.170 --> 05:06:22.270
Orlando Sequera: that can take years

2988
05:06:22.480 --> 05:06:26.250
Orlando Sequera: in litigation, people can. This is taken to a court.

2989
05:06:26.430 --> 05:06:38.050
Orlando Sequera: and it can be escalated to a different court, and it can take years before a resolution is made our project. Can we have to close our project. So the sure answer is

2990
05:06:38.290 --> 05:06:46.470
Orlando Sequera: the way we're gonna. If that happens in your project, that might very well be a question in your exam. If you have a dispute

2991
05:06:46.520 --> 05:06:47.920
Orlando Sequera: with a vendor.

2992
05:06:48.160 --> 05:06:51.109
Orlando Sequera: and you went through all the steps of

2993
05:06:51.300 --> 05:06:59.270
Orlando Sequera: the dispute. Resolution process, including negotiation, was impossible. Settlement was impossible.

2994
05:06:59.440 --> 05:07:11.050
Orlando Sequera: You went through an alternative dispute resolution that was impossible. Can I close that procurement? The answer is, yes, the way it's done is you're going to, and this is what will happen in real life

2995
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:15.370
Orlando Sequera: if the last resort which is litigation is the only option left.

2996
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:27.640
Orlando Sequera: That's what you need to document in your procurement documentation to your project, and then it gets offloaded to the legal department. You're not the one that is going to go to litigation. Remember, we're not lawyers, right?

2997
05:07:27.710 --> 05:07:35.230
Orlando Sequera: So the legal department of your organization. They are the ones that are going to handle that open

2998
05:07:35.260 --> 05:07:41.980
Orlando Sequera: legal item, not you. So you document that this there is a dispute

2999
05:07:42.080 --> 05:07:46.090
Orlando Sequera: that we try. We followed all the escalation process

3000
05:07:46.150 --> 05:07:48.350
Orlando Sequera: to close this procuring work.

3001
05:07:48.520 --> 05:08:08.849
Orlando Sequera: They still it. The the only option left is litigation. That's what you're going to document in the procurement, and that's how you're going to close that procurement. But you always always please remember that for the exam always close procurements always even in that situation. Legally, it's going to take care of it, and that's what they do. That's their job.

3002
05:08:08.860 --> 05:08:09.580
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3003
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:12.600
Orlando Sequera: So please remember that for

3004
05:08:12.690 --> 05:08:14.159
Orlando Sequera: the exam as well.

3005
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:26.409
Orlando Sequera: We always close procurements, and another type of question. When it comes to changes we always create a change request. This is another type of a

3006
05:08:26.570 --> 05:08:29.169
Orlando Sequera: exam question that they can come at you.

3007
05:08:30.320 --> 05:08:34.000
Orlando Sequera: You are working in Project Xyc. At

3008
05:08:34.240 --> 05:08:37.080
Orlando Sequera: this particular organization, and

3009
05:08:37.780 --> 05:08:39.199
Orlando Sequera: all of this sudden

3010
05:08:39.330 --> 05:08:44.180
the CEO of the organization came down and asked: you.

3011
05:08:45.280 --> 05:08:49.399
Orlando Sequera: Orlando, we have to implement this change. We do not have time

3012
05:08:49.470 --> 05:09:05.899
Orlando Sequera: to create a change request. This is a very important change. We have to a implement, this change a: what do you do in that situation? I'm gonna ask you that question. What? I'm gonna open up the chat. What do you do in that situation? The CEO of the organization came down. They ask you

3013
05:09:06.460 --> 05:09:07.190
Orlando Sequera: a

3014
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:16.149
Orlando Sequera: ornando, you don't, we don't have time for for this integrate change controlled Mambo Jumbo. We have to implement this change right now. What do you do in that situation?

3015
05:09:21.260 --> 05:09:21.820
Oh.

3016
05:09:23.210 --> 05:09:24.170
Orlando Sequera: exactly

3017
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:27.540
Orlando Sequera: so. The good answer is going to be.

3018
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:34.749
Orlando Sequera: We have to follow this process at all time. I'm. Gonna post the chat. I see that many of you are.

3019
05:09:35.380 --> 05:09:42.470
Orlando Sequera: Many of you are getting me correct. So what you do in this situation there's going to be one of the possible answers that is going to tell you. Well.

3020
05:09:42.650 --> 05:09:54.320
Orlando Sequera: you we have to. We're several leaders, right? We're they promised. We're gonna keep our jobs. So we wanna we we have to provide the awareness to our stakeholders. Mr. Or Miss the CEO.

3021
05:09:54.530 --> 05:09:57.159
Orlando Sequera: We have to understand the impact

3022
05:09:57.480 --> 05:10:02.589
Orlando Sequera: of that change to the project. We can just go ahead and implement the change. We need to understand

3023
05:10:02.610 --> 05:10:04.699
Orlando Sequera: the impact on the scope

3024
05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:22.899
Orlando Sequera: and the impact on the budget and the impact on the schedule of that change. Otherwise we're going to be adding risk to our project. That is, along those lines that's going to be the right answer. So bottom line is, we always follow the change control process, and that is for

3025
05:10:23.260 --> 05:10:35.340
Orlando Sequera: a a predictive approach. That is right. So we're following a break, the approach Under every single circumstance we follow the change control process. They are going to try to test you. They're going to try to trick you on that

3026
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:37.769
Orlando Sequera: always for the change control process

3027
05:10:38.490 --> 05:10:41.810
Orlando Sequera: a update. We also have to.

3028
05:10:42.430 --> 05:11:01.099
Orlando Sequera: As these updates changes the as these changes are are going to start costing updates, we also need to update our project management plan a: we might need to update our scope, our timelines, our work packages in our Wbs and team member assignments

3029
05:11:01.130 --> 05:11:03.750
Orlando Sequera: it for agile teams. It's a little bit different.

3030
05:11:04.600 --> 05:11:05.980
Orlando Sequera: They might have

3031
05:11:06.550 --> 05:11:09.919
Orlando Sequera: user stories that are at the bottom of the

3032
05:11:10.180 --> 05:11:12.790
Orlando Sequera: for the backlock. Those might be

3033
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.770
Orlando Sequera: dropped

3034
05:11:14.210 --> 05:11:21.290
Orlando Sequera: to make room for a for these changes. So that happens all the time. Remember, of the and agile. The scope is an influence.

3035
05:11:21.980 --> 05:11:24.530
Orlando Sequera: and this is what we have covered. So far

3036
05:11:24.860 --> 05:11:28.679
Orlando Sequera: we have been able to cover a how to

3037
05:11:28.740 --> 05:11:33.629
Orlando Sequera: evaluating address external business environment to changes for impact on scope.

3038
05:11:33.920 --> 05:11:38.249
Orlando Sequera: and we also cover how to manage project changes.

3039
05:11:39.130 --> 05:11:42.590
Orlando Sequera: All right. So we have come to the end of

3040
05:11:42.900 --> 05:11:44.399
Orlando Sequera: Lesson 5,

3041
05:11:44.850 --> 05:11:48.299
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to start with Lesson 6.

3042
05:11:48.420 --> 05:11:58.340
Orlando Sequera: But before we do that we're gonna take a break, and when we come back. We're going to continue with this topic. So we're gonna take our last 10 min break and we'll be back in 10 min.

3043
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:13.170
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with the last lesson for our project.

3044
05:12:13.720 --> 05:12:14.900
Orlando Sequera: Now

3045
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:17.580
Orlando Sequera: we're going to talk about.

3046
05:12:17.970 --> 05:12:19.539
Orlando Sequera: close the project

3047
05:12:19.560 --> 05:12:24.210
Orlando Sequera: or face. We're gonna talk about what happens when you close the product or face.

3048
05:12:24.690 --> 05:12:27.559
Orlando Sequera: And we're gonna be addressing that as

3049
05:12:28.280 --> 05:12:31.960
Orlando Sequera: the last lesson for our content today.

3050
05:12:32.730 --> 05:12:33.680
Okay.

3051
05:12:35.210 --> 05:12:36.500
Orlando Sequera: when it comes

3052
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:37.620
Orlando Sequera: 2

3053
05:12:41.970 --> 05:12:44.929
Orlando Sequera: for the closure or face closure.

3054
05:12:44.980 --> 05:12:49.610
Orlando Sequera: we're going to learn about the reasons and activities that need to occur.

3055
05:12:50.300 --> 05:12:54.329
Orlando Sequera: A. Related to the closure of a face of a project

3056
05:12:54.350 --> 05:12:58.290
Orlando Sequera: you we can either close a face, or we can either close a project.

3057
05:12:58.680 --> 05:13:05.379
Orlando Sequera: We have to be able to explain the benefits that we gain from that project or face, and how they were managed, and also

3058
05:13:06.040 --> 05:13:13.489
Orlando Sequera: go over the reasons for knowledge transfer, remember lessons learned, and how they relate to the closure of your

3059
05:13:13.550 --> 05:13:15.129
Orlando Sequera: project or face.

3060
05:13:18.460 --> 05:13:21.930
Orlando Sequera: We're going to start with just that we're going to go over

3061
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:24.559
Orlando Sequera: project or face closure.

3062
05:13:28.010 --> 05:13:28.990
Orlando Sequera: and

3063
05:13:34.970 --> 05:13:43.370
Orlando Sequera: let me start by saying that every single project needs to be closed. Everything. Every single project is going to go through a closure face.

3064
05:13:43.490 --> 05:13:46.850
Orlando Sequera: Remember what we said before a project this

3065
05:13:47.100 --> 05:13:53.719
Orlando Sequera: we set this on day one. That's the basic definition of a project. A project is a temporary endeavor.

3066
05:13:53.930 --> 05:13:59.250
Orlando Sequera: That's the textbook definition. Temporary means. It has a definite beginning.

3067
05:13:59.780 --> 05:14:04.379
Orlando Sequera: and he has a definite end. They are not opening the

3068
05:14:05.980 --> 05:14:08.809
Orlando Sequera: why projects or faces close.

3069
05:14:09.930 --> 05:14:11.310
Orlando Sequera: it can be.

3070
05:14:11.740 --> 05:14:14.550
Orlando Sequera: and and I hope that in most cases

3071
05:14:14.580 --> 05:14:21.590
Orlando Sequera: this is what happens to your to your projects, that your stakeholders accept your deliverables.

3072
05:14:21.710 --> 05:14:26.530
Orlando Sequera: We were building that one story home. We completed the home we compared the house

3073
05:14:26.680 --> 05:14:30.599
Orlando Sequera: building a one-story house. We completed the house

3074
05:14:30.740 --> 05:14:33.369
Orlando Sequera: with the requirements based on the

3075
05:14:34.280 --> 05:14:50.279
Orlando Sequera: what was agreed upon, the scope. That was a great problem with a customer, and we follow that acceptance criteria that was set at the beginning of the project, and we were able to deliver just that, and we follow an integrated approach with the project management plan. Of course, this acceptance criteria was

3076
05:14:50.520 --> 05:14:53.810
Orlando Sequera: maybe was modified throughout the life cycle of the project.

3077
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:54.770
Orlando Sequera: In

3078
05:14:54.800 --> 05:15:04.969
Orlando Sequera: we use a requirements, traceability matrix to track the evolution of the changes of those requirements. Perhaps when we start originally the

3079
05:15:05.310 --> 05:15:06.910
Orlando Sequera: the roof, what they.

3080
05:15:07.150 --> 05:15:11.200
Orlando Sequera: the customers wanted to have a metal roof on the house, but they change

3081
05:15:11.400 --> 05:15:16.999
Orlando Sequera: the requirement to have Spanish style or shingles in the roof.

3082
05:15:17.020 --> 05:15:25.430
Orlando Sequera: So we got to keep track of those changes. We do that with the requirements traceably matrix, because right now we're showing the deliverables

3083
05:15:25.460 --> 05:15:30.810
Orlando Sequera: here, Mr. Customer or Mrs. Customer, we built the house with

3084
05:15:31.630 --> 05:15:34.680
Orlando Sequera: with a with with Spanish dial, because

3085
05:15:34.860 --> 05:15:48.970
Orlando Sequera: that was your requirement, and we have it documented here in the requirements forxibility, matrix, and we have this sign off your sign of your approval to implement that change. So that's how it gets done. Okay.

3086
05:15:49.240 --> 05:15:56.999
Orlando Sequera: Or if we're following an agile approach, it's a little bit different, Si similar in a way. But we use

3087
05:15:57.090 --> 05:16:00.249
Orlando Sequera: the definition of done that covers

3088
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:09.500
Orlando Sequera: the acceptance criteria, we not only go recording by requirement, we have a definition of done that is applicable to all the features that we are developing.

3089
05:16:09.580 --> 05:16:24.860
Orlando Sequera: and that's how the final acceptance occurs. We do that every iteration multiple times we do the same. But instead of doing it at the end of the project. When the house is built. We're doing this every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks, every 4 weeks.

3090
05:16:24.900 --> 05:16:34.020
Orlando Sequera: But that's how that's how we do it. Imagine what what changes is the frequency right? Remember, Remember that we're providing

3091
05:16:34.600 --> 05:16:40.649
Orlando Sequera: we're building an increment we're providing portions of functionality. One iteration at a time.

3092
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:44.700
Orlando Sequera: But final acceptance is gonna occur prior to product release.

3093
05:16:44.810 --> 05:16:45.420
Okay.

3094
05:16:46.570 --> 05:16:47.650
Orlando Sequera: then.

3095
05:16:49.130 --> 05:16:55.189
Orlando Sequera: ideally, that's how you closed your projects when you completed all this code that was like read upon, put

3096
05:16:55.460 --> 05:16:57.569
Orlando Sequera: in the event of

3097
05:16:58.340 --> 05:16:59.950
Orlando Sequera: a

3098
05:17:00.270 --> 05:17:03.170
Orlando Sequera: major changes that make

3099
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:09.709
Orlando Sequera: your project no longer feasible. For example, your project was to

3100
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:12.040
Orlando Sequera: develop a new

3101
05:17:14.000 --> 05:17:20.390
Orlando Sequera: applicant tracking system ats for your organization. Not all. But there was a change

3102
05:17:20.530 --> 05:17:28.269
Orlando Sequera: in the environment, and your organization was acquired by a different organization. So. If that's the case.

3103
05:17:28.860 --> 05:17:29.880
Orlando Sequera: then

3104
05:17:30.260 --> 05:17:33.629
Orlando Sequera: chances are that the current organization

3105
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:41.870
Orlando Sequera: has already an Ats, and they don't need a new applicant tracking system. So your your pro is no longer feasible.

3106
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:58.940
Orlando Sequera: So that happens all the time, or simply that the organization run out of money. They don't we. We don't have any more money for for that project I mean more due to changes due to budget constraints in the organization, etc. So in that case we also

3107
05:17:58.950 --> 05:18:04.080
Orlando Sequera: close the project. We have to document the reasons why what happened

3108
05:18:05.410 --> 05:18:17.350
Orlando Sequera: and we have to document it, and we have to formally close the project. Okay, so those are the 2 ways that we can close a project or face, either by complete satisfaction.

3109
05:18:17.400 --> 05:18:25.579
Orlando Sequera: satisfactorily completing the requirements, delivering the requirements as per the scope. There was a greater problem with the customer

3110
05:18:25.680 --> 05:18:26.780
Orlando Sequera: in

3111
05:18:26.930 --> 05:18:41.139
Orlando Sequera: the pro team was able to deliver what they're expecting, or by termination like. In this case, something a major change that makes the project project no longer feasible. No longer the cyber. There's no more money, or they M. There are major risks

3112
05:18:41.320 --> 05:19:00.269
Orlando Sequera: that make the successful completion impossible. That happens also in many, many cases. So. But we still have to document the actual reasons, and we have. That's how we close that project or face. And what do I mean by

3113
05:19:00.680 --> 05:19:01.770
Orlando Sequera: closing

3114
05:19:03.010 --> 05:19:11.569
Orlando Sequera: a project or face activities we have. If we completed all this code, we have to get formal acceptance, sign off of the deliverables

3115
05:19:11.640 --> 05:19:13.100
Orlando Sequera: by the customer.

3116
05:19:13.330 --> 05:19:17.359
Orlando Sequera: We have to also transition this deliverables to the customer.

3117
05:19:17.500 --> 05:19:18.170
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3118
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:23.210
Orlando Sequera: we have to notify our organization functions, update any

3119
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:31.730
Orlando Sequera: organizational process assets prepare a final report for a project, and this is for a predictive. Mainly.

3120
05:19:31.780 --> 05:19:34.089
Orlando Sequera: we have to prepare final report.

3121
05:19:34.120 --> 05:19:45.300
Orlando Sequera: We have to complete, conclude any external obligations, including legal, re regulatory, contractual, or transfer of of liability. And this is where those procurement

3122
05:19:45.630 --> 05:19:46.660
Orlando Sequera: that are

3123
05:19:47.010 --> 05:19:56.970
Orlando Sequera: a associated with the project. We also have to close those procurements in the event of that scenario that I mentioned before, we have a dispute with a vendor.

3124
05:19:57.040 --> 05:20:08.660
Orlando Sequera: They we went through the escalation process. We had. We tried to have negotiation and come up with a settlement that was impossible. We exhausted every single resource.

3125
05:20:08.680 --> 05:20:20.900
Orlando Sequera: Even they'll turn an alternative to resolution. We went through mediation, and they still contest a They still have a dispute. They there, there's no other option. Then.

3126
05:20:20.930 --> 05:20:28.479
Orlando Sequera: going through litigation, we have to document that procurement that it went. It is going to go to

3127
05:20:29.380 --> 05:20:37.400
Orlando Sequera: with all the history that I just mentioned. We, as we we went through all the steps in the escalation process that didn't work

3128
05:20:37.600 --> 05:20:56.649
Orlando Sequera: this has to be. This is going to be handled by the legal department of our organization. That's how we close that procurement. We cannot have any procurement activities open before we can close the project. That is really important to keep in mind. So Don't, let them trick you. With that we always close procurements.

3129
05:20:56.660 --> 05:21:14.870
Orlando Sequera: We always close projects, but we have to close our procurements before we can close our project. So in that case the legal department is gonna go. It's gonna go and and and work with that dispute. They're the ones that are gonna go to court, and they're the ones that are gonna take care of that dispute. It's offloaded

3130
05:21:15.120 --> 05:21:17.339
Orlando Sequera: from your project. Okay.

3131
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:20.510
Orlando Sequera: Because, as you know, that can take years.

3132
05:21:20.650 --> 05:21:27.230
Orlando Sequera: any one that has gone through litigation, know exactly what i'm talking about. It can take years for that process to

3133
05:21:27.280 --> 05:21:35.309
Orlando Sequera: to come up with a resolution, and you don't have years in your project, most most likely. So that's what happens. You close it that way, you document it.

3134
05:21:35.390 --> 05:21:35.980
Okay.

3135
05:21:36.160 --> 05:21:37.290
Orlando Sequera: department work.

3136
05:21:37.440 --> 05:21:54.229
Orlando Sequera: We have to archive project information. We also have to release our resources and update their skill set to if they went for training, and they got certifications, and they also improve their skill set that has to be documented. That's also part of the Close

3137
05:21:54.460 --> 05:21:57.130
Orlando Sequera: or Project Face. Okay.

3138
05:21:58.020 --> 05:22:06.979
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more about the final report. This is a summer report and performance. How we did when it comes to scope scheduled quality and cost and risks.

3139
05:22:07.170 --> 05:22:09.739
Orlando Sequera: And another important aspect of

3140
05:22:10.450 --> 05:22:27.900
Orlando Sequera: closure is also lessons learned. You gotta make sure that your lessons learn are up to date, that your lessons to register is finalized and makes its way to the lessons repository of the Inf. Of the organization that is important.

3141
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:33.250
Orlando Sequera: for

3142
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:36.489
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to transitions and handovers.

3143
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:39.349
Orlando Sequera: this is when we're deploying to

3144
05:22:40.340 --> 05:22:42.980
Orlando Sequera: a to production, to a live environment.

3145
05:22:43.060 --> 05:22:50.750
Orlando Sequera: if it's, if it's a if we're following a predictive approach, the deliverables are going to be handed to the customer, so the house is delivered to the customer.

3146
05:22:50.780 --> 05:22:52.660
Orlando Sequera: The one story house that we built.

3147
05:22:52.740 --> 05:22:55.589
Orlando Sequera: and or if it's an agent approach.

3148
05:22:56.230 --> 05:23:01.149
Orlando Sequera: we can do partial deliveries at the end of each iteration.

3149
05:23:01.260 --> 05:23:06.549
Orlando Sequera: Technically, we can deliver that functionality that we built in our iterations

3150
05:23:06.630 --> 05:23:07.830
Orlando Sequera: into.

3151
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:12.259
Orlando Sequera: We can deliver that to production, their production ready, those functionalities. Okay.

3152
05:23:12.660 --> 05:23:14.960
Orlando Sequera: we do partial deliveries in

3153
05:23:15.160 --> 05:23:18.929
Orlando Sequera: agile. And then, if we're following the hybrid approach.

3154
05:23:19.090 --> 05:23:25.730
Orlando Sequera: we can tailor the solution that delivers value, most likely in an incremental way, as we produce

3155
05:23:26.030 --> 05:23:29.570
Orlando Sequera: functionality that's value. We follow a very similar approach

3156
05:23:30.190 --> 05:23:33.190
Orlando Sequera: that we follow in agile. We can release that

3157
05:23:33.550 --> 05:23:39.220
Orlando Sequera: into production, so our customers can start benefiting from that functionality

3158
05:23:39.540 --> 05:23:41.150
Orlando Sequera: the add value.

3159
05:23:41.180 --> 05:23:42.640
Orlando Sequera: Keep in mind. That

3160
05:23:42.970 --> 05:23:53.499
Orlando Sequera: is, some organizations. They have what is called a transition plan or a rollout plan. That is not a component of your overall project management plan.

3161
05:23:55.080 --> 05:23:59.269
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect that is taken into account when it comes to

3162
05:23:59.610 --> 05:24:03.240
Orlando Sequera: hand over readiness is that we gotta make sure that

3163
05:24:03.660 --> 05:24:07.689
Orlando Sequera: and organizations are paying attention more and more to this. That organization.

3164
05:24:08.220 --> 05:24:11.980
Orlando Sequera: I'm: sorry. Your customers, your stakeholders, are ready to receive

3165
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:19.769
Orlando Sequera: whatever it is that we build with a project. Okay, whether it is a product, a service, or a result, so they can.

3166
05:24:20.370 --> 05:24:32.160
Orlando Sequera: So we can increase the chances of them being successful with the new product service. So so they are. But that means that we have to work with training for getting them ready, getting them

3167
05:24:32.170 --> 05:24:46.330
Orlando Sequera: train getting them up to speed on what they're gonna get, and also providing all the documentation that they need. So this process of transition and hand over readiness is as move as possible. Okay.

3168
05:24:47.310 --> 05:24:48.560
Orlando Sequera: remember that.

3169
05:24:48.670 --> 05:25:02.920
Orlando Sequera: Take a resistance to change happens, so we try to address that as much as possible, and that means you have to have some awareness and provide the awareness of the benefits, the benefits, realization, plan.

3170
05:25:03.250 --> 05:25:14.509
Orlando Sequera: benefits, management, plan for the project and make sure that he gets used that is, tied up to the value of the project. So make sure that you take into account that your

3171
05:25:14.670 --> 05:25:27.969
Orlando Sequera: users are ready. They have the training and the documentation needed. Also. The business is ready to adopt the new product service. A result Your project team is ready to transition, because once they transition is

3172
05:25:28.060 --> 05:25:29.640
Orlando Sequera: off, law is is

3173
05:25:29.710 --> 05:25:45.140
Orlando Sequera: off their plates. If they're no longer they're no longer the ones that are gonna be working on that particular product service. So they're gonna have support staff that are gonna be providing the support, and they also might need to be trained. They also might need to be

3174
05:25:45.150 --> 05:25:58.790
Orlando Sequera: a provided with specific documentation. So we gotta take that into account. That's also part of project closure, and it is important we have to think about the future right, and set our customers

3175
05:25:58.840 --> 05:26:03.190
Orlando Sequera: for success. Once they a take over

3176
05:26:03.860 --> 05:26:07.780
Orlando Sequera: and start using the product service so that we created with our project

3177
05:26:08.180 --> 05:26:09.500
Orlando Sequera: some of those

3178
05:26:09.880 --> 05:26:12.239
Orlando Sequera: transition and hand over activities

3179
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:13.710
Orlando Sequera: A:

3180
05:26:13.800 --> 05:26:14.900
Orlando Sequera: They

3181
05:26:15.080 --> 05:26:29.950
Orlando Sequera: are gonna provide end user awareness. They're gonna help you to increase the level of end user awareness. They're also gonna help you to increase the probability of successful adoption and also increase the chances of benefits. Realization

3182
05:26:30.200 --> 05:26:36.679
Orlando Sequera: it. As I mentioned before, some of the some of the important aspects of the transition are training

3183
05:26:36.790 --> 05:26:39.629
Orlando Sequera: training your users to make the best use of

3184
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:48.449
Orlando Sequera: the new product service over. So whatever it is that you created with your project documentation provided documentation. This is something that a

3185
05:26:48.510 --> 05:26:57.810
Orlando Sequera: some team members have a hard time understanding. It's not just the functionality. We also got to provide the documentation, so there are people that are going to be working with this.

3186
05:26:58.000 --> 05:27:00.500
Orlando Sequera: a function that we created

3187
05:27:00.630 --> 05:27:05.070
Orlando Sequera: communication between the product team and the organization. And then

3188
05:27:05.420 --> 05:27:13.069
Orlando Sequera: one thing that happens in in in many organizations is that you have to also define.

3189
05:27:13.120 --> 05:27:14.260
Orlando Sequera: I call it

3190
05:27:14.500 --> 05:27:23.759
Orlando Sequera: quote unquote warranty period. It is what is properly known as post implementation support, which is going to be done by the team. So

3191
05:27:24.450 --> 05:27:32.759
Orlando Sequera: I've seen that in some organizations this can be one week or 2 weeks after deployment in which the actual project team provides a support port.

3192
05:27:32.820 --> 05:27:40.169
Orlando Sequera: After that it's going to be the help desk or whatever support staff a department they have in place.

3193
05:27:40.220 --> 05:27:43.500
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that has to be defined as part of transition.

3194
05:27:50.370 --> 05:27:51.590
Orlando Sequera: and

3195
05:27:51.900 --> 05:27:59.599
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to transition, and when it comes to training the documentation, transition readiness, remember that we have

3196
05:27:59.830 --> 05:28:00.900
Orlando Sequera: some.

3197
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:10.589
Orlando Sequera: Why do we have? Do maybe wondering Why can we just send them the documentation? Read the document, and that's it they're going to be. They're going to be ready

3198
05:28:10.650 --> 05:28:20.210
Orlando Sequera: because we have 2 types of knowledge. We have explicit knowledge that can be in a document. But what about tacit knowledge?

3199
05:28:21.900 --> 05:28:32.210
Orlando Sequera: Can we easily document. I'm gonna open. I'm gonna unpo the chat for a second. That's it. Knowledge is it? Is. Is it easy for you to articulate tastic knowledge?

3200
05:28:32.420 --> 05:28:37.739
Orlando Sequera: Please please feel free to use a chat. No right kind of hard to document how to

3201
05:28:38.100 --> 05:28:39.459
Orlando Sequera: learn how to play

3202
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:43.989
Orlando Sequera: the guitar, for example, or it comes with experience exactly

3203
05:28:44.490 --> 05:28:45.500
Orlando Sequera: exactly

3204
05:28:46.480 --> 05:28:47.230
Orlando Sequera: correct.

3205
05:28:47.280 --> 05:28:49.360
Orlando Sequera: So i'm going to post the chat

3206
05:28:50.010 --> 05:28:52.129
Orlando Sequera: correct. That's why

3207
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:55.210
Orlando Sequera: we have to use a combination. It's not just

3208
05:28:55.660 --> 05:28:58.089
Orlando Sequera: preparing a documentation. That's part of it.

3209
05:28:58.110 --> 05:29:10.630
Orlando Sequera: but we also have to work with our provide the training, and this has to be tailored to specific a situation with your project. We have to tailor, that

3210
05:29:11.140 --> 05:29:12.609
Orlando Sequera: to your specifics

3211
05:29:13.290 --> 05:29:16.279
Orlando Sequera: in your specific organization

3212
05:29:16.410 --> 05:29:18.699
Orlando Sequera: and your your specific. But

3213
05:29:18.950 --> 05:29:19.530
okay.

3214
05:29:21.160 --> 05:29:22.080
Orlando Sequera: also.

3215
05:29:23.250 --> 05:29:26.820
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to paying and closing contracts.

3216
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:33.319
Orlando Sequera: the payment at the payment

3217
05:29:33.490 --> 05:29:37.129
Orlando Sequera: payment schedule is going to be defined in the contract

3218
05:29:37.940 --> 05:29:50.010
Orlando Sequera: always. And this is something that you as the project manager, do you gotta be on top of this. Not You're working with the procurement legal departments, right? But it is your project You're just toward that. You have to watch this closely.

3219
05:29:50.520 --> 05:29:52.179
Orlando Sequera: You have to make sure

3220
05:29:52.210 --> 05:29:55.780
Orlando Sequera: that the suppliers and vendors are paid

3221
05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:58.260
Orlando Sequera: as per the contract terms.

3222
05:29:58.440 --> 05:30:01.900
Orlando Sequera: Okay, it's your project you have you? You can.

3223
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:05.780
Orlando Sequera: You have to make sure that that gets done. Okay, when

3224
05:30:06.010 --> 05:30:22.949
Orlando Sequera: and usually the way we do it. As we said before, we to make it easy for everyone, for the vendor and for the project team and for us to Pm. We tie this payments. One best practice is to tie this payments to milestone significant events in your project. So

3225
05:30:23.210 --> 05:30:26.800
Orlando Sequera: pay the suppliers always in accordance with contract terms.

3226
05:30:26.980 --> 05:30:29.230
Orlando Sequera: Do not delay payments

3227
05:30:29.440 --> 05:30:30.580
Orlando Sequera: unless

3228
05:30:30.800 --> 05:30:32.350
Orlando Sequera: that's based on

3229
05:30:32.590 --> 05:30:37.790
Orlando Sequera: the project closes unless that's what specified in the contract. Okay.

3230
05:30:37.810 --> 05:30:41.060
Orlando Sequera: pay your vendors as per the comfort

3231
05:30:41.250 --> 05:30:42.050
Orlando Sequera: period.

3232
05:30:42.730 --> 05:30:43.590
Orlando Sequera: All right

3233
05:30:43.750 --> 05:30:44.620
Orlando Sequera: in

3234
05:30:45.610 --> 05:30:49.160
Orlando Sequera: finalizing the contracts. Going again over

3235
05:30:50.160 --> 05:30:52.670
Orlando Sequera: what we mentioned before a.

3236
05:30:54.840 --> 05:30:59.050
Orlando Sequera: You have to archive contract documentation.

3237
05:30:59.220 --> 05:31:08.450
Orlando Sequera: The closure of the contract has to be done whenever the work is completed. In the event. Again, i'm going to reiterate that one more time. In the event of

3238
05:31:08.670 --> 05:31:11.289
Orlando Sequera: a contract being disputed by the vendor

3239
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:16.460
Orlando Sequera: and and your organization, they buy an organization. You have to

3240
05:31:17.020 --> 05:31:19.460
Orlando Sequera: go through the escalation process.

3241
05:31:20.080 --> 05:31:21.749
Orlando Sequera: You try to settle

3242
05:31:21.880 --> 05:31:26.129
Orlando Sequera: that didn't work for negotiation? You tried to use alternate

3243
05:31:26.200 --> 05:31:33.390
Orlando Sequera: alternate dispute resolution, using a mediator, for example, that doesn't work, then last resort.

3244
05:31:33.640 --> 05:31:36.110
Orlando Sequera: You have to document this contract

3245
05:31:36.450 --> 05:31:56.089
Orlando Sequera: and in this procurement activity, and say that this will be handled by the legal department because we exhausted all the options available. And this is how we're going to close and finalize this contract. Legal department will take care of that litigation, not you. That's how you close your procurement. That's how you close this contract in your

3246
05:31:56.100 --> 05:31:56.930
Orlando Sequera: specific

3247
05:31:57.260 --> 05:32:00.199
Orlando Sequera: project. Okay? And also

3248
05:32:00.450 --> 05:32:04.630
Orlando Sequera: you have to document all this information so you can

3249
05:32:04.860 --> 05:32:06.920
Orlando Sequera: then

3250
05:32:07.620 --> 05:32:08.750
Orlando Sequera: keep track of

3251
05:32:08.970 --> 05:32:10.969
Orlando Sequera: like possible lessons from

3252
05:32:11.180 --> 05:32:13.709
Orlando Sequera: that will benefit you in the future.

3253
05:32:16.570 --> 05:32:17.540
Orlando Sequera: Also.

3254
05:32:18.020 --> 05:32:19.770
Orlando Sequera: what have we covered so far?

3255
05:32:20.600 --> 05:32:22.339
Orlando Sequera: We talked about

3256
05:32:22.430 --> 05:32:24.320
Orlando Sequera: negotiating project agreement.

3257
05:32:24.660 --> 05:32:26.420
Orlando Sequera: and we also talked about

3258
05:32:26.690 --> 05:32:32.490
Orlando Sequera: a planning match, project, face or closure for transitions. We talked about transition readiness.

3259
05:32:32.520 --> 05:32:39.569
Orlando Sequera: and we now understand that we have to close every single aspect of a project documented Archive. It

3260
05:32:39.770 --> 05:32:49.179
Orlando Sequera: it so it's ready for. And and also the lessons learned are documented and ready for future use. That is really important.

3261
05:32:51.070 --> 05:32:56.700
Orlando Sequera: Now we're gonna talk about benefits. Realization. This is important. Remember what we said on day one

3262
05:32:56.740 --> 05:32:58.130
Orlando Sequera: we do projects.

3263
05:32:58.380 --> 05:33:03.250
Orlando Sequera: Project: Success is tied up to adding value and adding value

3264
05:33:03.420 --> 05:33:05.539
Orlando Sequera: means benefits, realization.

3265
05:33:05.730 --> 05:33:09.559
Orlando Sequera: That's why organizations are investing money and time and resources

3266
05:33:09.760 --> 05:33:13.410
Orlando Sequera: in their in their projects.

3267
05:33:13.620 --> 05:33:14.330
Orlando Sequera: So

3268
05:33:15.610 --> 05:33:17.670
Orlando Sequera: we know now that we have

3269
05:33:18.720 --> 05:33:25.939
Orlando Sequera: with the adaptives. If we, if we're following an agile approach, we can deliver increment incremental value

3270
05:33:26.330 --> 05:33:27.870
Orlando Sequera: as soon as possible.

3271
05:33:27.900 --> 05:33:28.850
Orlando Sequera: But

3272
05:33:29.090 --> 05:33:36.969
Orlando Sequera: for a predicted project is that's not the case, it may be years before a predicted project closes for benefits

3273
05:33:38.500 --> 05:33:47.199
Orlando Sequera: to be realized and value delivery. It may take a longer time. It all depends on the work, the type of project and the desire outcomes. Okay.

3274
05:33:47.380 --> 05:33:56.299
Orlando Sequera: So benefits are going are going to accrue a averse stages depending on the project Life cycles use with agile. It's going to be a

3275
05:33:56.890 --> 05:34:04.980
Orlando Sequera: pretty much it right away. That's the goal with Agro. It's also the nature of the work and the intended outcomes. So

3276
05:34:05.900 --> 05:34:09.280
Orlando Sequera: a if we're following another approach to deliver a software

3277
05:34:09.610 --> 05:34:17.690
Orlando Sequera: for the accounting department, we can the values deliver early. We can start delivering functionality. One iteration at a time.

3278
05:34:17.840 --> 05:34:20.350
Orlando Sequera: but in some other cases

3279
05:34:20.420 --> 05:34:29.230
Orlando Sequera: a other type of projects. They might take years. They might take months. So before we can start seeing the benefits. Okay. So we have

3280
05:34:29.420 --> 05:34:31.760
Orlando Sequera: early benefits, realization.

3281
05:34:32.000 --> 05:34:41.469
Orlando Sequera: We following a medal approach or adaptive. We have long term benefits realization. If we are a using a different approach, usually with

3282
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:42.710
Orlando Sequera: with some.

3283
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:48.470
Orlando Sequera: They've projects, not all of them. It's some of them. It's. It depends on the specific situation

3284
05:34:49.290 --> 05:34:51.570
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

3285
05:34:54.070 --> 05:35:00.179
Orlando Sequera: the benefits, transition. And so statement, there's some responsibilities. If we're following that

3286
05:35:00.380 --> 05:35:07.710
Orlando Sequera: a a predictive approach, any improvement or modification to be to the labor benefits is a new project

3287
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:13.470
Orlando Sequera: we'll follow in the management. Approach. It's a little bit different. Any improvements of modifications

3288
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:17.639
Orlando Sequera: to the labor benefits are proposed as work

3289
05:35:17.950 --> 05:35:27.320
Orlando Sequera: next future iteration and their place on we prioritize in the backlog. Why is that? Because the scope is not fixed? This cope is an influx.

3290
05:35:27.550 --> 05:35:39.590
Orlando Sequera: and if it's a hybrid approach. Organizations are going to tailor solutions for benefits, realization and sustainment. Okay. An example will be devops, development operations

3291
05:35:39.870 --> 05:35:41.290
Orlando Sequera: or hyper-

3292
05:35:42.820 --> 05:35:47.100
Orlando Sequera: benefits. Transition and sustainment.

3293
05:35:48.480 --> 05:35:49.660
Orlando Sequera: We have

3294
05:35:50.740 --> 05:35:52.579
Orlando Sequera: a depending on the approach.

3295
05:35:53.730 --> 05:35:54.840
Orlando Sequera: A.

3296
05:35:54.950 --> 05:35:58.750
Orlando Sequera: The project team. They deliver benefits to the customer organization.

3297
05:35:59.150 --> 05:36:05.799
Orlando Sequera: the customer. If we're following a predictive approach, they make sure that there's continued generation of improvement.

3298
05:36:06.030 --> 05:36:08.989
Orlando Sequera: and they also capture additional customer inputs

3299
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:15.329
Orlando Sequera: from the perspective. The product owner, project manager. If we're using a natural or a hybrid approach.

3300
05:36:15.880 --> 05:36:20.179
Orlando Sequera: We work with customers it to identify the work that is required

3301
05:36:20.440 --> 05:36:25.389
Orlando Sequera: based on what adds the most value to them. For the desire improvements

3302
05:36:25.620 --> 05:36:26.660
Orlando Sequera: A.

3303
05:36:26.900 --> 05:36:29.249
Orlando Sequera: They provide plan performance data.

3304
05:36:29.540 --> 05:36:30.370
Orlando Sequera: team

3305
05:36:30.610 --> 05:36:34.390
Orlando Sequera: work with a business owner to suggest benefits, realization for metrics.

3306
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:36.320
Orlando Sequera: And again.

3307
05:36:36.480 --> 05:36:37.290
Orlando Sequera: really.

3308
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:41.659
Orlando Sequera: the approach is a little bit different. But with the

3309
05:36:42.630 --> 05:36:47.409
Orlando Sequera: actual a pro. If we're following a module approach, or even a hybrid approach

3310
05:36:47.600 --> 05:36:49.410
Orlando Sequera: it's more about

3311
05:36:49.820 --> 05:36:58.220
Orlando Sequera: what at the most value. That's what's going to be done first. We use metrics to measure the performance, but

3312
05:36:58.300 --> 05:37:14.399
Orlando Sequera: add a added value is gonna happen in a shorter term compared to a predictive approach. We're gonna take other factors into account, and we have to update our different plans, update our different artifacts.

3313
05:37:14.410 --> 05:37:26.599
Orlando Sequera: It changes are gonna have ripple effects in multiple areas of our project as we have been able to learn, and that also goes with benefits, transition, and sustainment. So it's

3314
05:37:26.760 --> 05:37:31.039
Orlando Sequera: the same principle. But in this case we're talking specifically about

3315
05:37:31.280 --> 05:37:33.840
Orlando Sequera: benefits, transition, and sustainment.

3316
05:37:34.820 --> 05:37:39.229
Orlando Sequera: We have, as we have mentioned before, a benefits management plan.

3317
05:37:40.080 --> 05:37:42.329
Orlando Sequera: This is a document that is developed

3318
05:37:42.380 --> 05:37:44.649
Orlando Sequera: by the organization to define

3319
05:37:44.810 --> 05:37:46.510
Orlando Sequera: the potential benefits

3320
05:37:46.540 --> 05:38:00.539
Orlando Sequera: from the project effort. This is created. Even before the project starts, we start working on the project. This is a major input to authorize in the project. And I'm going to open up the chat. What is the artifact that

3321
05:38:01.350 --> 05:38:04.890
Orlando Sequera: formally authorizes the project? The existence of the project?

3322
05:38:05.060 --> 05:38:06.760
Orlando Sequera: Please feel free to use the chat.

3323
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:15.969
Orlando Sequera: the project charter. It's the product charter. So this is created before the product. Charter is screen. This is an input to the product. Charter Pilot.

3324
05:38:16.680 --> 05:38:18.740
Orlando Sequera: Okay, I'm going to post the chat.

3325
05:38:20.910 --> 05:38:31.089
Orlando Sequera: The benefits mentioned plan. This is going to examine the request of benefits, including tangible and intangible business value is that that will be realized from the project.

3326
05:38:31.240 --> 05:38:35.109
Orlando Sequera: The term is the timeframe for short and long term benefits

3327
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:36.340
Orlando Sequera: realization.

3328
05:38:36.380 --> 05:38:48.349
Orlando Sequera: and it also is going to identify a base, a benefits owner that is responsible for achieving the benefits, including metrics, needs to be measured and who is going to measure those results.

3329
05:38:48.460 --> 05:38:49.130
Okay.

3330
05:38:49.390 --> 05:38:55.800
Orlando Sequera: in the plan, we have to determine whether we have any pro remaining project risk that could prevent our project

3331
05:38:55.880 --> 05:38:57.570
Orlando Sequera: from benefit achievement.

3332
05:38:57.600 --> 05:39:00.140
Orlando Sequera: And when key stakeholders are

3333
05:39:00.240 --> 05:39:03.600
Orlando Sequera: working, and then you find these are project benefits at this point.

3334
05:39:04.470 --> 05:39:09.169
Orlando Sequera: Provide them with suggestions on how the benefits should be measured.

3335
05:39:10.290 --> 05:39:12.230
Orlando Sequera: the benefits owner.

3336
05:39:15.490 --> 05:39:16.660
Orlando Sequera: This is

3337
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:27.590
Orlando Sequera: an individual that is gonna be working with either the project manager or the team lead. If we're following a manual approach during the project to make sure that the benefits are managed as they are delivered.

3338
05:39:27.800 --> 05:39:30.179
Orlando Sequera: They're going to help in that transition

3339
05:39:30.840 --> 05:39:32.299
Orlando Sequera: at the end of the project

3340
05:39:32.520 --> 05:39:33.230
Orlando Sequera: to

3341
05:39:34.090 --> 05:39:35.600
Orlando Sequera: A, when

3342
05:39:35.620 --> 05:39:36.580
Orlando Sequera: it

3343
05:39:37.020 --> 05:39:48.950
Orlando Sequera: the request of benefits are transferred to the receiving organization. They are gonna make sure that the metrics measurement metrics are in place, and they're established and followed, and they report

3344
05:39:48.990 --> 05:39:50.480
Orlando Sequera: to operate management

3345
05:39:50.540 --> 05:39:51.959
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

3346
05:39:52.040 --> 05:39:54.399
Orlando Sequera: realize results of the

3347
05:39:54.430 --> 05:39:56.289
Orlando Sequera: benefits that were delivered

3348
05:39:57.360 --> 05:40:04.690
Orlando Sequera: in a predictive approach. Benefits Owner may be a business analyst. It could be a sponsor. It could be an operations manager

3349
05:40:04.710 --> 05:40:07.740
Orlando Sequera: in Agile is usually the product owner.

3350
05:40:07.870 --> 05:40:23.499
Orlando Sequera: They're responsible for making sure that the project provides benefits to the organization. You want to be wondering why is the product owner? Because, remember, we are constantly reprioritizing the product owner is in charge of reprioritizing the product backlog to add

3351
05:40:23.720 --> 05:40:26.709
Orlando Sequera: the most value possible to

3352
05:40:27.180 --> 05:40:35.400
Orlando Sequera: the business by that reproduction based on what based on what adds the most value. That's why it's the product owner.

3353
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:41.100
Orlando Sequera: We also have to be able to verify this benefits realization.

3354
05:40:41.490 --> 05:40:44.790
Orlando Sequera: We have to use the chosen metrics.

3355
05:40:44.880 --> 05:40:49.540
Orlando Sequera: The per owner has to report on progress for each tangible benefits

3356
05:40:49.840 --> 05:40:52.140
Orlando Sequera: for intangible benefits.

3357
05:40:52.560 --> 05:40:53.800
Orlando Sequera: Subjective

3358
05:40:54.610 --> 05:41:00.829
Orlando Sequera: qualitative determination may be the most appropriate way we have to report on this

3359
05:41:01.170 --> 05:41:05.130
Orlando Sequera: tangible benefits. Progress progress towards a

3360
05:41:05.170 --> 05:41:07.279
Orlando Sequera: those benefits we met

3361
05:41:07.490 --> 05:41:14.970
Orlando Sequera: any benefits at risk of not being realized as planned, that has to be reported as well. Any negative impact on strategic objectives

3362
05:41:15.000 --> 05:41:18.270
Orlando Sequera: and potential ending of the project team support

3363
05:41:26.160 --> 05:41:40.070
Orlando Sequera: it. You might wonder, in a predictive project once the transition is complete, who's responsible for very fine? The benefits are realized. So after we deliver our product service, a result. If we're following a predictive approach.

3364
05:41:40.120 --> 05:41:57.499
Orlando Sequera: then there is gonna be someone in the organization a benefits manager. That is usually that's the the individual that or benefits owner that is, gonna make sure that it's responsible to make sure to measure whether the benefits were realized or not.

3365
05:41:59.710 --> 05:42:11.070
Orlando Sequera: All right. So what have we cover? We cover benefits we cover that we have to evaluate and deliver project benefits, some value that is important. That's the main goal of the project

3366
05:42:11.630 --> 05:42:12.870
Orlando Sequera: project benefits

3367
05:42:12.940 --> 05:42:15.970
Orlando Sequera: and add value to our customers.

3368
05:42:18.280 --> 05:42:19.230
Orlando Sequera: Also

3369
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:21.340
Orlando Sequera: we have.

3370
05:42:23.060 --> 05:42:24.000
Orlando Sequera: i'm, a.

3371
05:42:24.170 --> 05:42:33.459
Orlando Sequera: That is important in any project that is part of closing which is knowledge transfer. This has to do with lessons learned. This is super important.

3372
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:43.239
Orlando Sequera: When we are archiving our project documentation, we hold. We gotta make sure that one of those artifacts the less of a register is

3373
05:42:44.010 --> 05:42:45.140
Orlando Sequera: up to date

3374
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:54.589
Orlando Sequera: is reviewed and also up to date, and we are making sure that we are that we have been able to finalize that.

3375
05:42:54.660 --> 05:42:59.460
Orlando Sequera: Listen, sort of register, because remember, this is kind of If we're following

3376
05:42:59.970 --> 05:43:17.910
Orlando Sequera: a predictive approach. The lessons from register is going to make its way to a larger repository that we call the lessons learned repository, that is, for the entire organization. Every single project is going to send. It's lessons or register it's individual. Let's sort of register to this

3377
05:43:17.920 --> 05:43:24.999
Orlando Sequera: large repository that we call, let's just run repository, and whenever we whenever we start a new project.

3378
05:43:25.510 --> 05:43:42.509
Orlando Sequera: so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. We would like to learn. Go over the list of learn of similar projects, we should start by reviewing those lessons to learn. That is why we call that an opa. We have to review lessons from from previous project, but we also have to help

3379
05:43:42.540 --> 05:43:44.820
Orlando Sequera: a to make that

3380
05:43:45.050 --> 05:44:00.550
Orlando Sequera: repository better over time. That's how we do it, what we are able to learn in our own projects that has to make its way to that repository. That's part of knowledge, Management a. And we do that in both predictive and active

3381
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:03.490
Orlando Sequera: a approaches, if we do it

3382
05:44:04.330 --> 05:44:05.220
Orlando Sequera: to.

3383
05:44:06.240 --> 05:44:08.670
Orlando Sequera: if if we do it, following

3384
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:10.510
Orlando Sequera: a predictive approach.

3385
05:44:10.530 --> 05:44:19.279
Orlando Sequera: we that's that's how we do it finalize. The less registered makes its way to the less repository. But if we

3386
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:30.890
Orlando Sequera: are following an adaptive approach, we conduct retrospectives, and what do we go over? Retrospective. We go over. Let us learn that we can apply in the very next iteration.

3387
05:44:30.950 --> 05:44:33.649
Orlando Sequera: So we do it, regardless of the approach.

3388
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:36.259
Orlando Sequera: More and more organizations are

3389
05:44:36.420 --> 05:44:53.220
Orlando Sequera: a paying attention to lessons. Learn a knowledge transfer because it translates to a improve efficiencies when it comes to cost when it comes to schedule, when it comes to working with vendors, etc. So they don't have to reinvent the wheel.

3390
05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:56.850
Orlando Sequera: More and more and more important is given to knowledge. Transfer

3391
05:44:57.710 --> 05:45:00.030
Orlando Sequera: specifically when we.

3392
05:45:00.970 --> 05:45:03.230
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to retrospective

3393
05:45:03.250 --> 05:45:14.500
Orlando Sequera: in agile. We do it at the end of each iteration, and teams go over. What? When? Well, what, when run, what can be improved, and they can help us to improve

3394
05:45:14.550 --> 05:45:17.770
Orlando Sequera: over time, so we do it multiple times in agile

3395
05:45:17.940 --> 05:45:37.129
Orlando Sequera: and the hybrid as well. But if we're following an a a predictive approach, we can do that at the very end of the project and have lessons. Learn retrospective meeting to go over what? What? We're willing the project to gonna give, give, give the chance to everyone to participate, document that finalize

3396
05:45:37.140 --> 05:45:51.650
Orlando Sequera: the documentation in your less to sort of register and send that to the lessons repository and share the results with the sponsor and other stakeholders. So that's also a something important.

3397
05:45:51.690 --> 05:45:53.180
Orlando Sequera: But we have to

3398
05:45:53.340 --> 05:45:59.710
Orlando Sequera: take the time. Remember that for the exam. Let's learn super important. We have to be able to

3399
05:45:59.800 --> 05:46:14.239
Orlando Sequera: document them because they take into account multiple aspects of the project they cover scope, they cover schedule risk. We can learn lessons from any area of our project vendor relationships, artifacts.

3400
05:46:14.290 --> 05:46:15.380
Orlando Sequera: etc.

3401
05:46:15.470 --> 05:46:16.170
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3402
05:46:20.000 --> 05:46:21.020
Orlando Sequera: Also.

3403
05:46:22.020 --> 05:46:28.890
Orlando Sequera: as I mentioned before, these lessons run are going to be consolidated and our individual lesson

3404
05:46:29.140 --> 05:46:34.010
Orlando Sequera: register. It's gonna make its way to a larger container that we call.

3405
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:47.480
Orlando Sequera: Let's just learn repository. So all of the entire organization. Any other projects that would like to that might benefit from our lessons around can actually go ahead and do it.

3406
05:46:47.520 --> 05:46:50.589
Orlando Sequera: Okay, it's a large database. Think of a database.

3407
05:46:51.970 --> 05:46:54.860
Orlando Sequera: Also. One thing that we prepare

3408
05:46:54.880 --> 05:46:57.220
Orlando Sequera: in that with our projects is

3409
05:46:57.610 --> 05:46:59.060
Orlando Sequera: a final report.

3410
05:46:59.720 --> 05:47:10.210
Orlando Sequera: This is something important that we have to prepare for any project. He has the description of the project, including the Liberals of milestones. We have scope, objectives.

3411
05:47:10.440 --> 05:47:11.440
Orlando Sequera: document.

3412
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:15.130
Orlando Sequera: We're going to documents of evaluation, criteria, and give evidence

3413
05:47:15.250 --> 05:47:17.800
Orlando Sequera: and of completion. Criteria

3414
05:47:17.850 --> 05:47:29.250
Orlando Sequera: quality objectives cost objective validation, information, schedule objectives, benefits, realization, and any risks or issues that were encountered. This can help

3415
05:47:29.640 --> 05:47:46.439
Orlando Sequera: the organization in the future. Other projects, even you as the pro, the the Pm. Of a similar project in the future. So this is important, and this is another a. This is part of the opa that we are in this case generating with our project.

3416
05:47:47.940 --> 05:47:49.560
Orlando Sequera: All right, so

3417
05:47:50.480 --> 05:47:59.970
Orlando Sequera: we have covered a the importance of knowledge. Transfer lessons, learn important, regardless of the approach we have to document that.

3418
05:48:00.050 --> 05:48:01.870
Orlando Sequera: and we have come

3419
05:48:02.480 --> 05:48:06.079
Orlando Sequera: to the end of the content.

3420
05:48:06.580 --> 05:48:09.660
Orlando Sequera: That is the end of the content. And now

3421
05:48:09.890 --> 05:48:11.220
Orlando Sequera: we still have

3422
05:48:12.920 --> 05:48:21.130
Orlando Sequera: a few minutes. You're not, do we? We? We're not ready to to to let you go. We still have a few minutes. What i'm going to do is

3423
05:48:21.540 --> 05:48:23.870
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to review the Q. And a.

3424
05:48:24.320 --> 05:48:25.210
Orlando Sequera: And

3425
05:48:26.290 --> 05:48:27.380
Orlando Sequera: answer

3426
05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:44.500
Orlando Sequera: your questions, and I would like to take a few minutes also to go over the actual Pmp. Exam. I would like to give you my final take my final exam strategy and tips for the Pmp. Exam. So all of you can be successful with the exam. So i'm gonna start

3427
05:48:44.600 --> 05:48:48.989
Orlando Sequera: a please vote on your question on the questions, and i'm going to start

3428
05:48:49.160 --> 05:48:54.990
Orlando Sequera: answering the questions. Well, before that, please make sure that you fill out the survey. This is the last day.

3429
05:48:55.070 --> 05:49:02.740
Orlando Sequera: Let us know what you liked about the class fill out the survey. We have been posting the link to the survey, and

3430
05:49:03.000 --> 05:49:04.980
Orlando Sequera: but so what's room for improvement? So

3431
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:07.129
Orlando Sequera: really value your feedback.

3432
05:49:07.780 --> 05:49:09.669
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm.

3433
05:49:10.180 --> 05:49:11.819
Orlando Sequera: And start working on

3434
05:49:12.610 --> 05:49:14.210
Orlando Sequera: answering the questions.

3435
05:49:22.590 --> 05:49:28.430
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the Q. A. Sometimes the authorization of the payment is at the end.

3436
05:49:28.460 --> 05:49:45.670
Orlando Sequera: What payment terms could be 90 days or 120 days. That's gonna be specified in the contract you pay them when you need to pay them, when, as per the contract, that's the whole point here. If it's 90 days, you pay 90 days, if it's 120 days, you pay in 120 days. So

3437
05:49:45.800 --> 05:49:53.279
Orlando Sequera: A. But if there is a dispute, what I was talking about was a dispute that's different. Okay. But you always pay

3438
05:49:53.320 --> 05:49:56.989
Orlando Sequera: based on the payment terms that are specified in the contract.

3439
05:49:57.100 --> 05:49:58.989
Orlando Sequera: You do not wait at the end of the project.

3440
05:50:00.030 --> 05:50:05.279
Orlando Sequera: What formal documentation to close the project. Well, we went over. All of that we cover that

3441
05:50:07.210 --> 05:50:13.710
Orlando Sequera: are these closing activities. On slide 120 done, is the question order? Not necessarily. They can be done in any order.

3442
05:50:18.330 --> 05:50:24.540
Orlando Sequera: Do I understand that you must always close procurements for your close projects? Yes.

3443
05:50:25.530 --> 05:50:28.109
Orlando Sequera: and because the litigation can take years.

3444
05:50:32.740 --> 05:50:40.699
Orlando Sequera: you always close procurements if they go to litigation. Yes, you document it, You document your procurement that it was

3445
05:50:40.920 --> 05:50:43.500
Orlando Sequera: that you follow the escalation

3446
05:50:44.180 --> 05:50:50.380
Orlando Sequera: process that didn't work, and the last reserve was litigation, and it was sent to the legal department.

3447
05:50:50.850 --> 05:50:51.520
Okay.

3448
05:50:51.720 --> 05:50:52.490
Orlando Sequera: so.

3449
05:50:52.720 --> 05:50:56.810
Orlando Sequera: But you always close procurement. You never leave procurements open.

3450
05:50:58.180 --> 05:51:04.380
Orlando Sequera: Going back to closing projects. Another type of question that they might come at you.

3451
05:51:04.540 --> 05:51:08.249
Orlando Sequera: Do you mind, is notorious for that? They might tell you

3452
05:51:08.370 --> 05:51:11.580
Orlando Sequera: that you might have a question, for example, that as you.

3453
05:51:11.680 --> 05:51:16.020
Orlando Sequera: the organization has been able to determine that

3454
05:51:16.040 --> 05:51:18.000
Orlando Sequera: they will be conducting

3455
05:51:18.280 --> 05:51:21.319
Orlando Sequera: a similar project, and they would like to.

3456
05:51:23.710 --> 05:51:26.470
Orlando Sequera: since the project is similar, they would like to keep the

3457
05:51:26.620 --> 05:51:28.180
Orlando Sequera: the project team

3458
05:51:28.980 --> 05:51:35.010
Orlando Sequera: a together, and they would like to keep the project open. What do you do in that situation?

3459
05:51:35.250 --> 05:51:39.140
Orlando Sequera: The answer is, no something along the lines of

3460
05:51:39.160 --> 05:51:51.269
Orlando Sequera: you. Get a close, your project, and then you have to go through a the same process, same planning processes for the new project. Okay, Under no circumstances, you keep any project open.

3461
05:51:52.160 --> 05:51:54.320
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you remember that for

3462
05:51:54.370 --> 05:51:55.670
Orlando Sequera: for the Exempt.

3463
05:51:57.980 --> 05:52:06.480
Orlando Sequera: How do you decide how long the hyper care should be? That depends on your organization. That depends on your organization. That's gonna be specified. It could be one week, 2 weeks.

3464
05:52:06.660 --> 05:52:09.199
Orlando Sequera: That changes from organization to organization

3465
05:52:10.030 --> 05:52:15.690
Orlando Sequera: training as a handover activity has to be accounted for in scope not only scope.

3466
05:52:15.760 --> 05:52:28.669
Orlando Sequera: it's also part of your budget, and it's also part of your schedule. So yes, it has to be. Take account it as part of your it's gonna have an impact on your scope. It's gonna have an impact on your budget because

3467
05:52:28.790 --> 05:52:29.879
Orlando Sequera: you need money

3468
05:52:29.940 --> 05:52:32.280
Orlando Sequera: and it's gonna have an impact on your schedule.

3469
05:52:32.440 --> 05:52:35.140
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so yes, it's gonna have

3470
05:52:35.290 --> 05:52:37.869
Orlando Sequera: impact in multiple areas of your project.

3471
05:52:42.020 --> 05:52:45.740
Orlando Sequera: Did you consider a project close when the last invoice has some paid?

3472
05:52:46.620 --> 05:52:52.800
Orlando Sequera: It depends. I mean, No, everything has to be. All the procurements have to be closed. Everything has to be closed

3473
05:52:52.820 --> 05:52:54.640
Orlando Sequera: in order to close the project

3474
05:52:57.780 --> 05:52:59.579
Orlando Sequera: is the benefit owner

3475
05:53:03.520 --> 05:53:08.399
Orlando Sequera: from within the project team or outside. Usually someone from outside the project team.

3476
05:53:18.740 --> 05:53:26.049
Orlando Sequera: Where can we find a comprehensive list of all artifacts? Pmi project mansion.com as multiple templates.

3477
05:53:29.570 --> 05:53:33.889
Orlando Sequera: Should not a transfer be fully complete before project closure? Yes.

3478
05:53:34.020 --> 05:53:35.620
Orlando Sequera: for that particular project.

3479
05:53:36.060 --> 05:53:44.650
Orlando Sequera: or can it last beyond, if some things need close, but certain resources are available. No, you should do it before you close your project. It's part of the closure activities.

3480
05:53:46.820 --> 05:53:52.519
Orlando Sequera: You're not gonna have time to go back and do it. You're gonna be working in a different project. Most likely

3481
05:53:59.660 --> 05:54:02.490
Orlando Sequera: is financial closure

3482
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:09.310
Orlando Sequera: with client also essential a closed-state project. Yes, you have to close all your procurement. As I mentioned before.

3483
05:54:23.630 --> 05:54:25.570
Orlando Sequera: there's a question.

3484
05:54:26.130 --> 05:54:42.849
Orlando Sequera: Thank you for answering my question about the eac for forecasting, but it's still not clear to me. Should we at the risk, for example, 20 K potential risk, or should we wait when we are confirmed that it is an issue? Well, remember that an issue is a negative risk, that material license.

3485
05:54:43.060 --> 05:54:44.839
Orlando Sequera: But in that case

3486
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:58.929
Orlando Sequera: it depends on the probability and impact of the risk. I will have to have a little bit more because the eac is about realities. What's happening in your project? Okay. So kind of mix in a couple of things that are

3487
05:54:59.280 --> 05:55:01.030
Orlando Sequera: Eac: so about

3488
05:55:01.200 --> 05:55:04.809
Orlando Sequera: it's about. Something that happened actually might be related to an issue

3489
05:55:05.140 --> 05:55:08.900
Orlando Sequera: rather than at risk at risk is an uncertainty. May or may not happen

3490
05:55:09.390 --> 05:55:17.469
Orlando Sequera: all right. So. If it happens, then you, it is confirm an issue, and then then it's going to have an impact on your project.

3491
05:55:23.000 --> 05:55:29.950
Orlando Sequera: It's in handover Renaissance transition management, planning with transition. It's actually transition part of the transition process.

3492
05:55:39.150 --> 05:55:49.969
Orlando Sequera: Transition is not a component of the pre match and plan. It's not one of the separate areas. That's where they're trying to tell you what it happens. Pmi is not saying that it doesn't happen end user training. We

3493
05:55:50.780 --> 05:55:52.770
Orlando Sequera: are taking that into account.

3494
05:55:52.810 --> 05:55:59.169
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that's part of the readiness, but it's not a set. We what we're saying here that you don't need a separate plan

3495
05:55:59.340 --> 05:56:02.659
Orlando Sequera: or this transition. You have to take it into account.

3496
05:56:02.730 --> 05:56:08.700
Orlando Sequera: A. B. But it is something that you have to do. But you, you don't need that specific plan that's what they were saying.

3497
05:56:10.900 --> 05:56:15.839
Orlando Sequera: Can benefit owner be a sponsor? Yes, in some cases absolutely yes.

3498
05:56:16.690 --> 05:56:26.780
Orlando Sequera: to whom our project benefits reported usually to a benefit. There's a benefits management department in the organization. But they're gonna keep track of the benefits

3499
05:56:30.360 --> 05:56:33.110
Orlando Sequera: is the review of lessons. Learned part of

3500
05:56:34.220 --> 05:56:36.870
Orlando Sequera: is the review of lessons learned

3501
05:56:37.420 --> 05:56:40.819
Orlando Sequera: of past similar projects, part of the

3502
05:56:40.970 --> 05:56:46.870
Orlando Sequera: former process of planning new projects. Yes, that's why we review organizational process assets.

3503
05:56:47.370 --> 05:56:49.190
Orlando Sequera: and we do that in planning

3504
05:56:54.090 --> 05:56:54.810
Orlando Sequera: and

3505
05:56:55.030 --> 05:57:08.240
Orlando Sequera: an example of a benefit, using house construction as an example. It could be that your a house is a energy efficient that has solar panels and the

3506
05:57:08.310 --> 05:57:14.170
Orlando Sequera: multiple benefits that can come with the house, so it's a it's solar, and it's greener.

3507
05:57:18.860 --> 05:57:19.440
Hmm.

3508
05:57:27.240 --> 05:57:40.680
Orlando Sequera: Shoot him the vessel ser, and be kept Pmo. To a repository. A Pmo. If there's a Pm. In place, they help with that. But there there is a repository in the organization. But if there's a Pm. If they're gonna make sure that it gets done.

3509
05:57:47.410 --> 05:57:48.960
Orlando Sequera: No, thank you very much.

3510
05:57:56.000 --> 05:58:01.029
Orlando Sequera: When does it warrant your continuous support to the final, probably get listed? Besides, the contract

3511
05:58:01.100 --> 05:58:02.560
Orlando Sequera: A.

3512
05:58:03.170 --> 05:58:08.919
Orlando Sequera: The way was explained was mostly from an internal perspective, like an internal project.

3513
05:58:09.260 --> 05:58:13.880
Orlando Sequera: But it's more about the warranty period that you have

3514
05:58:14.400 --> 05:58:20.349
Orlando Sequera: with the project team, right. It's usually one week or 2 weeks, or it could be more than that it could be a month. It depends.

3515
05:58:20.470 --> 05:58:21.700
Orlando Sequera: But is that

3516
05:58:22.350 --> 05:58:23.520
Orlando Sequera: extra

3517
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:24.900
Orlando Sequera: a

3518
05:58:25.310 --> 05:58:27.740
Orlando Sequera: oversight that your team is going to provide

3519
05:58:27.880 --> 05:58:33.179
Orlando Sequera: a after the product service of result has transition to

3520
05:58:33.650 --> 05:58:34.740
Orlando Sequera: production

3521
05:58:45.290 --> 05:58:51.059
Orlando Sequera: close out the Via stewardship transfer to operations to customer. Well, that's transition

3522
05:58:51.910 --> 05:58:56.089
Orlando Sequera: when you complete your project, and that's transition. But you gotta close your project.

3523
05:58:59.690 --> 05:59:07.380
Orlando Sequera: Do you consider the pride? Delivers have been accepted, but the last symbol has been paid. Usually that that should not be the case. You can close your project if

3524
05:59:07.450 --> 05:59:09.710
Orlando Sequera: the last payment hasn't been made.

3525
05:59:10.070 --> 05:59:10.930
yet

3526
05:59:11.280 --> 05:59:15.479
Orlando Sequera: you get a close procurement. Remember what we said. We got a close procurement.

3527
05:59:23.110 --> 05:59:28.069
Orlando Sequera: If the legal department wins to you, reevaluate the pray for completion. No, that that

3528
05:59:28.120 --> 05:59:32.080
Orlando Sequera: 3 years later. You might not even be in that organization. So no.

3529
05:59:35.820 --> 05:59:38.889
Orlando Sequera: the transition requirements makes part of a closer report.

3530
05:59:39.020 --> 05:59:39.890
Orlando Sequera: Yes.

3531
05:59:44.730 --> 05:59:50.680
Orlando Sequera: Do you run into a lot of stakeholders company people that don't want to go through all the Pm. Steps and planning processes.

3532
05:59:51.510 --> 05:59:54.890
Orlando Sequera: It happens in organizations that are new to project management.

3533
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:57.040
Orlando Sequera: but

3534
05:59:57.200 --> 06:00:02.900
Orlando Sequera: more and more organizations are starting to realize the benefits of this approach, and they will support it.

3535
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:17.900
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So I I think that we are.

3536
06:00:20.060 --> 06:00:33.889
Orlando Sequera: hey? There's another question. There's been a lot of discussions from Agile, so we also consider getting satisfied. Scrum master. It really depends on what you want to do with your career. Some people that are working in some industries. Yes, some other people. No.

3537
06:00:38.430 --> 06:00:41.360
Orlando Sequera: Would you primarily use Microsoft

3538
06:00:41.920 --> 06:00:43.859
Orlando Sequera: Project as a Pm.

3539
06:00:44.090 --> 06:00:48.570
Orlando Sequera: If we learn how to use it Well, that usually helps with predictive.

3540
06:00:48.620 --> 06:00:55.240
Orlando Sequera: with a predictive approach. But it's it really helps. If you're going to be a Pm. You have to learn how to use Microsoft Project.

3541
06:00:56.110 --> 06:00:58.870
Orlando Sequera: That's my personal opinion, at least

3542
06:00:58.890 --> 06:01:01.179
Orlando Sequera: all right. So I think we are

3543
06:01:02.720 --> 06:01:08.989
Orlando Sequera: pretty much caught up with the content related questions, and I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the exam.

3544
06:01:10.770 --> 06:01:17.559
Orlando Sequera: as I've been mentioned before. There's a few aspects that I would like to mention for the Pmp. Exempt. So let's start

3545
06:01:17.930 --> 06:01:19.870
Orlando Sequera: by talking about

3546
06:01:20.110 --> 06:01:22.749
Orlando Sequera: the structure of your Pmp. Exempt

3547
06:01:23.370 --> 06:01:28.330
Orlando Sequera: this new version of the Pmp. Exam. Which which is not really that news being 2 years.

3548
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:31.009
Orlando Sequera: they start in 2,021

3549
06:01:31.370 --> 06:01:33.180
Orlando Sequera: January of 2021

3550
06:01:33.890 --> 06:01:34.840
Orlando Sequera: is

3551
06:01:35.970 --> 06:01:37.420
Orlando Sequera: more.

3552
06:01:37.480 --> 06:01:40.659
Orlando Sequera: The key aspect is critical. Thinking.

3553
06:01:40.780 --> 06:01:47.310
Orlando Sequera: Okay. The key aspect is critical thinking. The questions most of the questions are going to be scenario based.

3554
06:01:47.460 --> 06:01:49.999
Orlando Sequera: They're not going to be asking you about

3555
06:01:50.660 --> 06:01:52.550
Orlando Sequera: definitions or

3556
06:01:52.910 --> 06:01:54.720
Orlando Sequera: tools or techniques

3557
06:01:54.770 --> 06:01:56.020
Orlando Sequera: that we

3558
06:01:56.870 --> 06:01:58.370
Orlando Sequera: cover in this content.

3559
06:01:58.420 --> 06:02:02.949
Orlando Sequera: That's not the type of question. So if you want to get more information over the type of

3560
06:02:03.190 --> 06:02:06.940
Orlando Sequera: the type of questions that you're going to be facing. Do you need to go to

3561
06:02:07.230 --> 06:02:08.120
Orlando Sequera: desperate

3562
06:02:08.690 --> 06:02:13.020
Orlando Sequera: test? Prep is going to be your main resource to take practice questions

3563
06:02:13.520 --> 06:02:16.159
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna get you exposed to the type of

3564
06:02:16.190 --> 06:02:19.499
Orlando Sequera: questions that you will be facing in your Pmp. Exam.

3565
06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:26.099
Orlando Sequera: If i'm not mistaken, I think the database is has around 600.

3566
06:02:26.240 --> 06:02:33.570
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to defer to the moderators on that. They're always accurate, but I think it has closely to 600 plus

3567
06:02:33.670 --> 06:02:36.910
Orlando Sequera: different questions that you can take.

3568

Orlando Sequera: and it will give you the chance to

3569
06:02:39.920 --> 06:02:41.000
Orlando Sequera: learn

3570
06:02:43.420 --> 06:02:57.400
Orlando Sequera: to learn about the Pmp. Exam. This is provided by skills, so you have to go to to Per CPU, and under we have covered that multiple times and precipio go to practice. There's one of the tabs that is called practice, and

3571
06:02:57.490 --> 06:03:04.529
Orlando Sequera: it has on the practice you will be able to get to. Oh, thank you very much, Kar. So

3572
06:03:04.930 --> 06:03:15.130

3573
06:03:15.380 --> 06:03:21.200
Orlando Sequera: and it's gonna get you exposed to the type of scenario questions in which critical thinking

3574
06:03:21.440 --> 06:03:31.039
Orlando Sequera: key aspect. Okay, these questions are vetted. My recommendation is, Be careful with there's some free resources out there. Some of them are

3575
06:03:31.290 --> 06:03:39.610
Orlando Sequera: good, some of them are not so good. Some of those questions are outdated, so be careful with the nature of the of the questions that you get

3576
06:03:39.870 --> 06:03:40.660
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3577
06:03:40.740 --> 06:03:41.760
Orlando Sequera: and

3578
06:03:42.680 --> 06:03:47.879
Orlando Sequera: take as many practice questions as possible. So your preparation you need to

3579
06:03:48.580 --> 06:03:51.749
Orlando Sequera: you completed the 35 h to make the requirement.

3580
06:03:52.380 --> 06:04:00.379
Orlando Sequera: The intention is not for for for you to know it all right away right now. You need time to digest what we cover in a week.

3581
06:04:00.610 --> 06:04:07.940
Orlando Sequera: and remember that it takes. You need a 100 h in average and 100 h in average to get ready to for that Pmp. Exempt

3582
06:04:08.130 --> 06:04:21.479
Orlando Sequera: It's it's not easy. It's not an easy exam. I'm: not gonna Sugar code the exam. It requires a lot of preparation in per CPU as well. You also have recorded videos that are gonna help you to do a deeper dive.

3583
06:04:21.490 --> 06:04:31.609
Orlando Sequera: You can go to per sepio and look for specific videos. If you want to learn more of an environment management. There are great specific videos in Per CPU as well that you can watch.

3584
06:04:31.750 --> 06:04:34.289
Orlando Sequera: and you can do a deeper dive

3585
06:04:34.380 --> 06:04:37.410
Orlando Sequera: and understand some of the concepts that might be new

3586
06:04:37.840 --> 06:04:40.749
Orlando Sequera: to you, that we cover in the class.

3587
06:04:41.040 --> 06:04:48.179
Orlando Sequera: If you are new to agile for those of you that have never worked with agile before Agile is new.

3588
06:04:48.570 --> 06:05:06.829
Orlando Sequera: I would recommend you to read the ads or practice Guide all the agile that you need to know, for the Pmp. Exam. Is cover here. This is one of the most important references for the exam. Okay. But remember that you said you use it as a reference. Notice a study guide. The same goes for the PIN. But

3589
06:05:06.840 --> 06:05:22.989
Orlando Sequera: you said as a reference, when you want to do a deeper dive, not as a study guide. They're not written as study guides. The Study guide. Is this content that you have here? This is the still version of those 10 different references that are condensed Here.

3590
06:05:23.000 --> 06:05:33.649
Orlando Sequera: let's talk a little bit about the exam. Another important aspect that we have covered also is the application. So you completed one of the requirements with this class, but you also need to

3591
06:05:34.380 --> 06:05:38.799
Orlando Sequera: be able to fill out your application. Complete your application.

3592
06:05:38.940 --> 06:05:55.679
Orlando Sequera: It treated as if you were, I think the closest analogy will be like whenever you are applying for a job. In using an applicant tracking system, it's pretty much the same principle. You have to add your personal information, this information about this class

3593
06:05:55.690 --> 06:06:08.230
Orlando Sequera: also. They probably the most important aspect is your experience section you have to have. If you have a 4 year college degree. Then you have to be able to provide information on 36,

3594
06:06:08.350 --> 06:06:14.009
Orlando Sequera: 36 months of leading projects. Experience of leaving projects for 36 months

3595
06:06:14.080 --> 06:06:18.190
Orlando Sequera: treat. It used to resume. I will recommend you to use the resume.

3596
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:23.689
Orlando Sequera: so you can get the dates, and they they cannot be any overlapping with that experience.

3597
06:06:23.920 --> 06:06:29.720
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that you provide your You write your experience from the perspective of

3598
06:06:29.790 --> 06:06:36.109
Orlando Sequera: what a project manager that, and what a project manager that is what we cover in this class. We are not.

3599
06:06:36.190 --> 06:06:50.930
Orlando Sequera: They sub them matter experts, we not the ones doing the work. I've seen many cases that many people start getting really technical. When we, when they explain what they did in their projects. We we don't do that. We are the Pms. We

3600
06:06:50.940 --> 06:07:06.600
Orlando Sequera: we help the team with. We create project management plans. We help with communications. We help with the issue of resolution. We help with developing this code, developing the budget, developing the the actual

3601
06:07:06.610 --> 06:07:21.049
Orlando Sequera: scheduled for the project. That's what we do, we we, we, we, we, we, we with risk identification. We don't do the technical aspects of the project. Okay, that for the application, once your application is approved, you have one year to take the Pmp. Exam.

3602
06:07:22.160 --> 06:07:22.910
Orlando Sequera: A:

3603
06:07:23.080 --> 06:07:40.390
Orlando Sequera: Let's talk about the specific experience for the Pmp. Exam. You can take it from home. That's one option. It's an online proctor that is gonna be watching you over the 230 min. You will have to log in. There is

3604
06:07:40.400 --> 06:07:59.479
Orlando Sequera: there is a company that is called Pearson View. They are the exam provider for the Project Management Institute, and you'll have to log in through. Go through a checking process if you're taking it from home. My recommendation is, if you decide to take it from home, do not use that work laptop.

3605
06:07:59.500 --> 06:08:11.090
Orlando Sequera: Use your personal laptop because you might have some firewalls in place that might prevent you from connecting properly to the to the application or personal view application.

3606
06:08:11.350 --> 06:08:14.480
Orlando Sequera: If your Internet connection is not

3607
06:08:14.530 --> 06:08:27.410
Orlando Sequera: reliable, do not take it from home. Do not take it for go to a testing center. That's the second option that you have go to a local testing center. Pearson View has multiple locations. You can check that out in their website.

3608
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:34.369
Orlando Sequera: Go to a testing center. And that's the decision that you have to make. Do you take it from home, or do you do it at a testing center?

3609
06:08:34.570 --> 06:08:42.970
Orlando Sequera: Basically it's the same experience for some people. It works better at a testing center. Some people like to go and take it from home. You're gonna have more options at home.

3610
06:08:43.140 --> 06:08:52.450
Orlando Sequera: My recommendation is, take that exam as early as possible in the day. I'm not a morning person per se. When I took it, I took it at noon.

3611
06:08:52.760 --> 06:08:55.610
Orlando Sequera: and it was 4 h back then.

3612
06:08:55.700 --> 06:08:56.420
Orlando Sequera: But

3613
06:08:56.690 --> 06:09:01.769
Orlando Sequera: do not take it at night, either. Don't take it late during the day. It's gruesome. It's gonna be

3614
06:09:02.170 --> 06:09:05.030
Orlando Sequera: 230 min plus 2

3615
06:09:05.070 --> 06:09:09.140
Orlando Sequera: built in 10 min. Breaks at our team and

3616
06:09:09.820 --> 06:09:12.740
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you take the breaks, Take the breaks.

3617
06:09:12.830 --> 06:09:22.809
Orlando Sequera: The exam is broken down into 3 sections. So this is the way it works. And that was covering one of the videos that bar a recorded for this class.

3618
06:09:23.590 --> 06:09:27.689
Orlando Sequera: You you're going to start with the first set of 60 questions.

3619
06:09:27.910 --> 06:09:28.989
Orlando Sequera: but you get it.

3620
06:09:29.220 --> 06:09:35.510
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect is: you have to manage your time. My recommendation is

3621
06:09:35.530 --> 06:09:37.430
Orlando Sequera: get used in test prep

3622
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:41.879
Orlando Sequera: to answer questions within 60 s or less. That's going to help you.

3623
06:09:42.010 --> 06:09:56.570
Orlando Sequera: because the clock is gonna start at 230, and it's gonna start taking down. It's not gonna really tell you whether you are on on time or not. You have to track that mentally, manually. Okay. So get used to 60 s or less. Go

3624
06:09:56.920 --> 06:10:02.759
Orlando Sequera: it. Start your first 60 questions when you get when you're getting to. When you get to the question Number 60,

3625
06:10:02.980 --> 06:10:07.540
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna get the option to take a break. But you have to submit

3626
06:10:07.560 --> 06:10:14.570
Orlando Sequera: those questions you can mark for review. If you don't know the answer, you can mark for review and go back, but

3627
06:10:14.730 --> 06:10:25.030
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you answer every single question, so otherwise it's going to count negative against your score. Every single question is going to be considered wrong. Okay.

3628
06:10:25.120 --> 06:10:26.670
Orlando Sequera: A. So

3629
06:10:26.940 --> 06:10:32.450
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you answer every single question. You submit your questions. Take your break, reset.

3630
06:10:33.380 --> 06:10:45.719
Orlando Sequera: You don't have to take the full 10 min, but you can. You can take up to 10 min. Then you come back. Go to your go to the restaurant, drink something, have a power bar available, etc. Then come back and continue for the next

3631
06:10:45.730 --> 06:10:53.580
Orlando Sequera: 60 questions. Then, when you get to question number 120, you're gonna have the option to take a second break, and that'll be

3632
06:10:54.420 --> 06:11:03.839
Orlando Sequera: a that's another chance for you to go to restaurant reset, relax. I strongly suggest you. Please take your breaks, take your breaks. Okay, and then

3633
06:11:03.870 --> 06:11:05.540
Orlando Sequera: your

3634
06:11:05.850 --> 06:11:07.380
Orlando Sequera: A.

3635
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:10.870
Orlando Sequera: You're going to come back for the last 60 questions.

3636
06:11:11.360 --> 06:11:24.960
Orlando Sequera: One thing that I'm. Seeing in the chat that I would like to point out the test Prep. Questions are practice, questions. These are mock exams. These are not the same questions that you will find verbatim in the Pmp. Exam.

3637
06:11:25.880 --> 06:11:41.510
Orlando Sequera: Only Pmi has those questions okay. But the test prep questions are practice questions that are written by project management professionals that are very similar. They're not the same similar to the ones that we that you will

3638
06:11:41.520 --> 06:11:46.879
Orlando Sequera: in style to the ones that you will encounter in your Pmp. Exam: okay.

3639
06:11:47.450 --> 06:11:49.830
Orlando Sequera: all right. That's a good point.

3640
06:11:50.080 --> 06:11:51.200
Orlando Sequera: Also

3641
06:11:51.540 --> 06:11:53.460
Orlando Sequera: a make sure

3642
06:11:53.530 --> 06:11:56.910
Orlando Sequera: that you take your breaks. You submit your exam

3643
06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:58.640
Orlando Sequera: the last section

3644
06:11:59.740 --> 06:12:00.660
Orlando Sequera: and

3645
06:12:01.250 --> 06:12:14.020
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna get the results right away. They're gonna tell you whether you pass or a or not. That's gonna happen immediately. You're gonna get the result. It's a pass or failed exam, and they're gonna give you only a report per domain.

3646
06:12:14.130 --> 06:12:16.160
Orlando Sequera: You and the categories are.

3647
06:12:16.590 --> 06:12:19.280
Orlando Sequera: Remember that we have 3 domains, right? So

3648
06:12:19.320 --> 06:12:34.550
Orlando Sequera: we have a people process and business environment, and they're gonna tell you whether you were below target on target, or they both target in each domain. That's all they're going to give you. They're not going to tell you which answers you get wrong. Which answer you got right.

3649
06:12:35.140 --> 06:12:38.250
Orlando Sequera: Not a graded exam. It's only passed or failed.

3650
06:12:39.280 --> 06:12:58.670
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect Release one more time. The exam is not based on the PIN book. Please please remember that the exam is based on the exam Content outline. Remember that we were making reference to exam content. Outl for the last 5 days. There's a reason for that, because that is what

3651
06:12:58.710 --> 06:13:01.440
Orlando Sequera: what you're gonna be testing in the Pmp. Exam.

3652
06:13:01.600 --> 06:13:15.460
Orlando Sequera: Step number one in the preparation right now. What I would recommend you to do is go ahead and review that exam. Content outline, perform a short analysis, mainly focusing on the strengths and witnesses that you personally have

3653
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:31.239
Orlando Sequera: and work on, making sure that the areas that you identify as a weakness you are able to address them and work on, making, transforming those weaknesses into into strength. I will that will be my my

3654
06:13:32.100 --> 06:13:34.319
Orlando Sequera: Then I will review the content

3655
06:13:35.020 --> 06:13:51.329
Orlando Sequera: again. Take practice questions as many as possible. Watch the videos that are recorded by Barb in with certain specific topics that you need to learn more about in value, management or conflict resolution. Watch this replace that you have available

3656
06:13:51.340 --> 06:13:59.379
Orlando Sequera: to you the 5, the 5 sessions, If you attend all, all, all the entire boot camp this is available to you, so

3657
06:13:59.430 --> 06:14:11.649
Orlando Sequera: please make sure that your view that take the time. It's gonna take you an average anywhere between 80 to 100 h and take practice questions. That's how you get ready for that exam. Don't drag it out. Either.

3658
06:14:11.740 --> 06:14:27.930
Orlando Sequera: Have a plan in place, I would say, for most people 6 to 8 weeks, a month and a half, 2 months in average after this class. That's a healthy a timeline. Don't let it linger. Don't wait too long because time a life gets in the way

3659
06:14:28.330 --> 06:14:29.340
Orlando Sequera: for

3660
06:14:29.600 --> 06:14:34.480
Orlando Sequera: the scenario questions as we have been mentioning before.

3661
06:14:34.610 --> 06:14:43.700
Orlando Sequera: Pay attention. First of all, read the questions properly. Understand exactly what they're asking. You. Okay, read the question

3662
06:14:43.940 --> 06:14:59.090
Orlando Sequera: I mean to end, because do my form an assumption in your mind about what they're asking you. But one little word or one little sentence at the end might change the entire question. Make sure that you understand what they're asking. You pay attention to the keywords

3663
06:14:59.780 --> 06:15:11.020
Orlando Sequera: that you are going to encounter in the questions, and by keywords I mean, what should I? What should you do next? What should you do first? What should you do now?

3664
06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:24.970
Orlando Sequera: What is the best approach. So look for those keywords, because, as I mentioned before, you're going to encounter some questions that are very similar in nature. But the keyword is, what's gonna make the difference?

3665
06:15:25.090 --> 06:15:28.030
Orlando Sequera: Okay, pay attention to those details. All right.

3666
06:15:35.160 --> 06:15:37.129
Orlando Sequera: There is a question.

3667
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:45.299
Orlando Sequera: Do you have to pass all 3 parts of the exam. But can you still pass if you do poorly on one part of the exam? Well, if you look at the percentages.

3668
06:15:45.790 --> 06:15:48.460
Orlando Sequera: 50 50 of the exam is

3669
06:15:48.550 --> 06:15:49.630
Orlando Sequera: process.

3670
06:15:49.920 --> 06:15:53.269
Orlando Sequera: One of the domains and 42 of the exam is

3671
06:15:53.540 --> 06:15:54.340
Orlando Sequera: people.

3672
06:15:54.730 --> 06:16:01.030
Orlando Sequera: So basically what they're saying is, you have to do well in process and people to pass the exam.

3673
06:16:01.870 --> 06:16:20.029
Orlando Sequera: the only one that you they remain their 8% basis environment. You can do. Okay with that, you don't you. You can do poorly in a in in business environments still past the exam right, but prefer to pass, prefer to pass so so, so the end short. Answer is, Yes, you.

3674
06:16:20.040 --> 06:16:27.710
Orlando Sequera: It's only 8, so that's that. That's one that you can that that you can it it? It's a little. It's less

3675
06:16:27.960 --> 06:16:32.690
Orlando Sequera: compared to the other 2. But you gotta do well in process, and you get to do well in people.

3676
06:16:32.920 --> 06:16:46.199
Orlando Sequera: But my advice is, Prepare to pass the exam. Don't, prepare to take the exam. We're here preparing you to pass. We're giving you everything that you need to be successful. Okay. So prepare to pass the exam.

3677
06:16:46.610 --> 06:17:03.900
Orlando Sequera: Work. On passing the exam. Do you want to take this exam? Mark my words. Only one time you don't want to take this exam more than once, so prepared to pass the exam, follow, trust the system, follow the steps, and you're going to be successful, all right. So that's really

3678
06:17:04.110 --> 06:17:22.389
Orlando Sequera: that's really important to keep in mind. A. I see a question in in the in the Q. A. There's no passing percent. It's Pmi doesn't publish that it's not published, not available. You have to work on, making sure that you are ready for that Exam. Okay, we have given you everything that you need

3679
06:17:23.250 --> 06:17:24.980
Orlando Sequera: to get ready for the exam.

3680
06:17:25.220 --> 06:17:27.309
Orlando Sequera: Try to give as much as possible.

3681
06:17:27.440 --> 06:17:30.770
Orlando Sequera: and now it's time for you to

3682
06:17:31.210 --> 06:17:46.140
Orlando Sequera: put in the blood and sweat to make sure that you get ready, that you watch your V. Those videos to get ready for the exam. Take your practice questions, and a is is it easy? No, but it is doable. A lot of people have done it, but it's one of the

3683
06:17:46.220 --> 06:17:51.399
