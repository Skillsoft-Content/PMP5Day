02:53:34	Sindy Alcantar:	what if a project was canceled due to environmental factors?
02:54:26	Meshach Barkley:	As a PM, who do you report to? Who guides and advise you on performance or solutions?
02:54:35	karunanithi kandasamy:	how Project management using in Agile scrum? because Agile is dynamic
02:54:44	Robins Ramirez:	Thank you!
02:55:01	Paula Blackford:	Thomas - that depends on some many  variants and circumstances surrounding your project
02:56:10	Seth Harrison:	My understanding of that is that the overall goal is to have a successful project termination, but if the project meets those early termination conditions, the stakeholders should decide to terminate and choose modification or restart.
02:56:24	Marta Nalik:	Could you please explain the difference between output and outcome? 
02:57:36	Delan Humphrey:	waterfall
02:57:37	William Hamilton-Vail:	Predictive
02:57:37	Hanna Pardee:	Predictive!
02:57:39	Michelle Geremia:	predictive 
02:57:40	Jaime Soto:	waterfall
02:57:41	Eddie Seward:	predictive
02:57:41	Daniel Cusinato:	Predictive
02:57:42	Colin Udoh:	Predictive
02:57:43	Saranya Azhagamanna Hariharan:	predictive
02:57:44	Sean Byerly:	karunanithi kandasamy

Which Project Management Methodology should be used is dependent on a project. Some projects won't work well with the Agile approach.
That being said, software development is a key example of a good project to use with the Agile approach. This is because you can create several iterations oof the software, testing it dynamically throughout the process.
02:57:46	JESSICA FOURNEY:	predictive
02:57:46	Rahul Chourasiya:	Predictive
02:57:55	Asma Seid:	waterfall
02:57:55	Daniel Cusinato:	Agile and then hybrid
02:58:15	karunanithi kandasamy:	thank you
02:59:19	Nicole Janes:	Thank you!
02:59:29	Sumit Kumar:	adaptive
02:59:37	Hanna Pardee:	Adaptive - change based approach and iterates 
02:59:55	Abdullah Galal:	I think the first approach is called the water fall approach, isn't it ?
03:00:04	Jotika:	adaptive
03:00:10	Jalisa Crutchfield:	So adaptive = agile? 
03:00:22	Delan Humphrey:	yes
03:01:11	Erika Tarzi:	so predictive is rigid?
03:01:23	Devon Belser:	t
03:02:16	Gregory Whitmarsh:	predictive has task dependencies, milestones that must be met in order to continue
03:02:19	karunanithi kandasamy:	How is the PM different from ITIL and Agile? It is confusing which is the right approach for what problem
03:02:49	Neil Flanders:	Seems like predictive is a better option when you know what the final outcome needs to be, but when the final outcome is maybe not as definitive, adaptive is the better option???
03:02:51	Maria Hannah Dalit:	comparatively predictive is rigid
03:04:07	Hanna Pardee:	Thats a good way to put it Neil, final outcome can impact type of life cycle/development 
03:04:55	Neil Flanders:	I also would be surprised if you see very many project management styles that are purely one or the other anymore.
03:05:02	Gregory Whitmarsh:	I typically use Agile for software and documentation projects, and predictive for hardware development
03:05:12	Dell Fletcher:	I think customer feedback impacts the lifecycle/development and the final outcome.
03:05:19	Kai Cao:	what is the difference between agile and incremental?
03:05:36	Gregory Whitmarsh:	When a project covers the three, ie. Test Engineering projects, I end up using a hybrid approach
03:05:42	Jaime Soto:	What's the difference between a Scrum Master and Agile Coach?
03:05:44	Neil Flanders:	Makes sense.
03:05:46	Frederick Williams:	Who determines what approach will be taken?
03:06:07	Jonika Poitier:	Are you able to get this powerpoint I dont see it in github
03:06:10	Wyatt Pierce:	Would you say that Agile helps prevent a bunch of detailed rabbit-hole work getting thrown out? It seems like predictive outputs can be off base for complex projects because of the lack of review of incremental iterations. Is that accuate?
03:06:17	Tim Wheeler:	Would you say predictive is ideally suited for repetitive projects? 
03:06:47	Gwendolyn Dedrick:	Can you have an overarching project that is managed iteratively, with sub-projects managed as deliverables? Or vice versa?
03:07:01	John Variakojis:	where is the traditional 'project manager' role in Adaptive (Agile)?
03:07:15	Ricardo Sanabria:	Can a plan base approach be change base on the project to a change base once the project starts? Meaning once you start one process you need to continue with that or can be change if the need is identified?
03:07:21	Jonika Poitier:	Are you able to get this powerpoint
03:07:42	Omobolanle Kayode:	In lay man’s terms wouldn’t it be, we get a useable product for instant and then deliver for test and amend if that doesn’t work has expected ie waterfall? And agile being test as we go and fix as we go?
03:07:43	Seth Harrison:	wouldn't the rabbit hole prevention be covered in the control measures throughout the project?
03:07:44	Oyundari:	Who authorizes agile project?
03:07:47	Maria Hannah Dalit:	jonika its in the resources:https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5Day
03:07:52	Maria Hannah Dalit:	look at slide decks..
03:08:09	JESSICA FOURNEY:	Do we need to have a big team or can it be a 1 person team to be consider a project?
03:08:10	Delan Humphrey:	It seems like the end goal would be to become predictive..
03:08:10	Buck Brunner:	Example of building homes: initial project Predictive, then adopt agile for further development or adding features?
03:08:18	Grace Ssekeba:	what is extent of planning in agile
03:08:42	Nathan Trotter:	cant use the voting feature, way too many test posts
03:08:44	karunanithi kandasamy:	Project Manager and Scrum master can work together? or are they is duplicate?
03:09:19	Rashawn Quinzy:	Agile seems like its the "implied tasks" within a main task
03:09:36	Rahul Ramanan:	I loved your class
03:10:06	Brendon Willy:	Delan, I would imagine it would all be per the customers request. If they want to be a bit more hands on, and see how things are going, you'd be rolling with a more agile approach. But if you can streamline some smaller projects, roll them as predictive
03:10:30	Brian Barksdale:	Test
03:10:38	Oyundari:	Who authorizes or approve agile project? Project sponsor?
03:10:41	Christine Chen:	does this bootcamp cover both pmbok 6 and 7? I heard that currently its pmbok 6 exam but there could be transition to pmbok 7 material exam. What is the cut off for 6 exam?
03:11:45	Sean Byerly:	karunanithi kandasamy

Scrum Masters lead scrum meetings and manage scrums

Project manager manages the overall project. Managing and reporting deliverables, driving change management, and completing any required documentations.
03:12:46	Sean Byerly:	Oyundari

Generally the organization leadership, determine what process is used, but more specifically the type of project will dictate what is the best approach.
03:12:58	Gregory Whitmarsh:	When I create a work/problem statement, I typically look at the three methodologies an make assessments and assumptions to the PM/PS. Based on cost, quality, schedule and resources, they will approve or make other suggestions
03:13:33	Sean Byerly:	As a project manager though, you should be able to provide insight to your leadership on what methodology to use and be able to logically explain why that process should be used.
03:13:41	Benjamin Giovingo:	Oyundari, typically project manager and/or project sponsor
03:14:18	null:	Do we need to refer PMBOK as well to clear the exam?
03:14:41	Silvia Ramirez Suarez:	Too soon to ask what's the difference between project or program manager?
03:14:48	Abdulrahman Al-Zahrani:	is PMO covered in detailed in this course ?
03:15:05	Uday Abban:	Does "Supportive" and ACOEs both have similar kind of roles ?
03:15:34	Andrew Murray:	You wouldn't have a Scrum Master  with a Project Manager. PO, SMs and Developers are within a flat organization (i.e. "Agile" "Scrum"). PMs reside mostly in waterfall methodlogies.
03:15:43	Brian Schwartzkopf:	does the literature still reference OPPAS and EFFAS
03:15:56	Guna sekhar T:	In my case I work as a Product Owner Chapter Lead along with  Project Management responsibilities. Is it even a thing?
03:16:18	Phuong Rosell:	I was able to see the resource tab and downloaded the files, but I don’t see it now.
03:29:47	Steven Cragg:	This seems roughly analogus to Strategic, Operational, and Tactical levels for the military
03:32:50	Shankar Chakraborty:	Is PM and Agile scrum master same role. Are they need to be highly technical Roles
03:33:03	Vergil Johnson:	What would be an example of a project-orientated organizatiopn>
03:33:14	Shankar Chakraborty:	Do they play roles in removing technical roadblocks for the project?
03:33:36	Brian Schwartzkopf:	construction company maybe
03:33:38	Rajat Gupta:	Can you give an example of a Functional manager?
03:33:59	Chaithanya Duryea:	Can you please send zoom link, I got kicked out of the class, joined from Precipio, but I get too many pauses and restarts. 
03:34:52	Cathe Alao:	how do we identify the type of organization structure our organization follows?
03:34:57	Dylan Costello:	Yes construction company, architectural firms..
03:35:02	Marco Egizi:	Maybe an events AV team, where a manager is in charge of the project, but also manages the entire staff directly.
03:35:51	Ebrima Cham:	Who manages the budget in functional department ?
03:35:59	Richard Winkelbach:	United States Air Force- Functional
03:36:00	Quincy Blunt:	my experiences seem to fall not the matrix category
03:36:03	Marco Egizi:	I believe my org is Functional or Weak Matrix.
03:36:06	Neil Flanders:	VJ - I imagine larger firms will allow for more project orientation as well, as they have the people to dedicate to a team.  However, with the drive to be more and more efficient, resource sharing is becoming the norm.
03:36:07	Teisha Akinpelu:	I am in a Project Management oriented org..
03:36:16	Teisha Akinpelu:	I manage the people and the projects
03:36:26	Zachary Peterson:	matrix 
03:36:31	Edward Hudson:	Most of my experience has been with Cross-Functional Teams (CFTs) with low-to-no direct authority over project participants/stakeholders.
03:36:31	Joshua Ternes:	Matrix
03:36:34	Delan Humphrey:	Project here as well
03:36:38	Kartik Porwal:	mATRIX
03:36:41	Marco Egizi:	I am in charge of the project and working with my clients.  But my technical staff is managed by the operations team.  I believe this is a functional team or a weak matrix.
03:36:52	Theresa Scabet:	My organization is a matrix with low authority
03:36:54	Dell Fletcher:	I work in cybersecurity. We are in an agile environment.
03:37:16	Brian Schwartzkopf:	agreed
03:37:19	Dell Fletcher:	I work in cybersecurity. We are in an agile environment.
03:37:49	Mark Nyberg:	Will we touch on ‘composite’ organizational structures?
03:37:53	Ajaysingh Dehariya:	test
03:38:01	Teisha Akinpelu:	“influence"
03:38:15	Valente Ortiz:	Test message
03:39:07	Catherine Gutierrez:	Can you provide examples of each org structure?
03:39:15	Nishant Sagar Purohit:	can i join this session via zoom as well as percipio both at same time , just to solve the audio issue.  will it count as live on percipio ?
03:41:09	Vibhuti Anand Jha:	Can you elaborate a further the domains.
03:41:22	Stefanie Stadler:	I saw in another Skillsoft PMP preparation video that the current PMP exams refer to PMBOK Guide 6th edition, not 7th edition - which is true? I started studying with the 6th edition. Are there many differences?
03:42:28	Nestor Daniel Vivas Contreras:	Test
03:42:30	Maria Hannah Dalit:	FYI the coursera google agile certification is pretty straight to the point, informative, and incredible organized if you guys are looking for a class that focus more on this agile concept.
03:42:38	Daniel Jimenez:	If agile is more than IT/software, why is there a PMP and an Agile PMP??
03:42:57	Edward Hudson:	Thanks, Maria!!
03:42:57	Benjamin Giovingo:	thank you, Maria!
03:43:09	Edward Hudson:	Thanks, Maria!!!
03:43:53	Daniel Jimenez:	If agile is more than IT/software, why is there a PMP and an Agile PMP??

03:44:32	Fredrick Brewer:	it originates in software dev, but can be applicable to many other things. 
03:44:45	Maria Hannah Dalit:	Agile is a specialization
03:45:08	Brian Schwartzkopf:	the latest ECO contains agile principles
03:45:37	Dylan Costello:	Defense contractor here and we are heavy on Agile
03:45:48	Brian Schwartzkopf:	in some industries you are starting to see prjects delivered that require both predictive and agile
03:45:50	Brian Schwartzkopf:	methods
03:46:00	Andrew Murray:	Agile is a methodology; it can be applied to anything.
03:46:22	Quincy Blunt:	I assume there has to be a specific friction point in the agile approach where the decision has to made to covert over to predictive or hybrid?
03:46:35	Chris Grubb:	https://www.infosysconsultinginsights.com/2019/06/12/the-risks-of-moving-to-mature-agile-too-fast-a-cautionary-tale/#:~:text=Boeing%20was%20an%20early%20Agile,Max%208%20faster%20to%20market.
03:46:39	Reim Emam:	can you give an example Brian?
03:47:07	Andrew Zeigler:	bullet 5 says stay out of the way and do not micromanage
03:47:08	Dell Fletcher:	This interesting. Bad guys/unethical hackers are always changing their TTPs. That is why agile environment makes sense. However, we still have to convince the business to authorize projects to allow us to make necessary changes in the logical landscape to keep our security posture high. Interesting environment to work in.
03:47:31	Brian Schwartzkopf:	if the deliverable is software, software always requires updating, therefor scope and budget may change once you reach a certain point in the lifecycle
03:47:36	Sean Byerly:	Defense contractor here...and we say we are working in the Agile methodology, but many still do not understand how this should look, work, or the principles.

Agile is a buzz-word in the Defense organizations and not completely embraced or understood.
03:47:39	Andrew Zeigler:	Bullet 5 says stay out of the way and do not micromanage
03:47:41	Brian Schwartzkopf:	but the agile project persists
03:48:09	Maria Hannah Dalit:	“Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of Waterfall. While Waterfall aims for predictability and tries to avoid change, Agile embraces the reality that the world, markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.”
03:48:52	Dylan Costello:	2 week sprints. 3 month Program Increments is what we do
03:49:05	Dell Fletcher:	That can be challenging in my environment. How can you convince the business that a cybersecurity tool that was implemented provided value to the company. How can you measure the success of the project.
03:50:10	Benjamin Giovingo:	report on what vulnerabilities are being managed by the tool, and the efficiencies it is providing to any given team?
03:50:29	John Hunter:	My broadband keeps on dropping out Apologies 
03:50:55	Sean Byerly:	Dell Fletcher,
Success should be measured in milestone accomplishments and showing the effectiveness of the project/tool by displaying and reporting network protection data.
03:51:51	Andrew Murray:	"Easy to understand, but difficult to master"
03:51:51	Hanna Pardee:	What Sean said, success is often measured by milestone, accomplishing goals based on stakeholder feedback 
03:52:01	Brian Schwartzkopf:	agile projects are like raising children
03:52:07	Marco Egizi:	Most of my projects seem to be predictive, but each one has quirks and differences.  Would you consider this to be "hybrid?”
03:52:16	Dell Fletcher:	Good points. Thanks all.
03:52:25	Dell Fletcher:	Brian I can concur with your comment.
03:52:43	Maria Hannah Dalit:	Who gives feedback when raising children lol
03:53:00	Brian Schwartzkopf:	the school the law
03:53:05	Daniel Zinoviev:	society
03:53:05	Brian Schwartzkopf:	the community
03:53:08	Rafal Oleksiak:	probably everyone :)
03:53:12	Brian Schwartzkopf:	the neighborhood
03:53:13	Brian Schwartzkopf:	LOL
03:53:15	William Mitchell:	The kids
03:53:25	Maria Hannah Dalit:	😄
03:53:36	Andrea Campbell:	@brian that is so accurate 
03:53:37	William Mitchell:	Every child is raised differently because they learn and respond differently
03:53:39	Nicholas Spitler:	"spare the rod"
03:53:44	Nathan Trotter:	PCS up until orders are received = Agile
once you receive orders = Predictive
03:53:47	Tara Niscak:	I imagine that there are lots of us with projects where success is measured by how little anyone else knows it happened (ie. lack of feedback = success). 
03:54:08	Benjamin Giovingo:	PCS?
03:54:09	Dell Fletcher:	DD-214?
03:54:14	Brian Schwartzkopf:	@nathan very true
03:54:48	Maria Hannah Dalit:	But good parents proactive vs reactive right? I feel like iterations based on feedback is reactive. Waterfall is proactive. I get your gist though
03:55:08	Richard Winkelbach:	DD214-Predictive and I can’t wait @Dell
03:55:09	Sean Byerly:	Good example Nathan, but remember Agile could also be used after orders are received.
03:55:38	Nathan Trotter:	well not really, you have a finite timeline, ie when you sign into your new unit right?
03:55:52	William Mitchell:	Yes, but you adapt your parenting style as you observe how effective it is - you also need to change as your kid ages - they need different inputs as they age
03:56:19	Richard Winkelbach:	RNLT @Nathan I concur
03:56:31	Sean Byerly:	That may be, but Agile can also work within a finite time. A project still has a start and end date, no matter what methodology you use.
03:56:59	John Schroeder:	What does PDU stand for?
03:57:05	Jason Taylor:	Only posting this here because I asked in the Q&A over 90 minutes ago:
03:57:08	Jason Taylor:	Is there a way to make the Q&A chronological? Everyone's posts are intermingled by time; some posts at 8:08 am are mixed with posts made at 9:15am (my time obviously.)


03:57:09	Gregory Whitmarsh:	Most projects from a high level are predictive, but the lower level tasks are an array of predictive and agile
03:57:23	Nathan Trotter:	@sean, that is a question I have. Software (or in my case dashboard vizualizations) are constantly being developed and updated. is there a point where a project just becomes change control?
03:57:29	John Schroeder:	Oh nevermind.
03:57:47	Sean Byerly:	Yes, after a point it becomes maintenance and is handled by someone else.
03:58:23	Nathan Trotter:	thats kinda what I thought, but it kinda blurs the lines a buit. thanks sean
03:58:25	Sean Byerly:	Once you have met the original agreed upon capabilities, the project ends.
03:58:49	Darryl George:	Where does Requirement Mgmt fall into this
03:58:52	Sean Byerly:	That is why the project manager has a paramount roll in any methodology.
03:58:53	Benjamin Giovingo:	Scope is still defined, and project closure then leads to operational maintenance
03:58:59	Gregory Whitmarsh:	enterprise visions usually have a cyclic or predictive process, where maintenance is a part of the continuous improvement group
03:59:11	Dell Fletcher:	Dashboard visualizations e.g. Power BI, Tableau, Kibana? I assume that would be used to project metrics to leadership on how well the project is doing after the project ends.
03:59:26	Dell Fletcher:	KPIs
03:59:27	Ahmed Ali:	External: Natural Disaster             Legal
03:59:29	Gregory Whitmarsh:	it can be time-based or contractual to a specific customer
03:59:44	Sean Byerly:	Darryl George, requirement management comes into play in the initiation and planning phases.
04:00:36	Sean Byerly:	Though much like in my organization, the project manager is involved in all requirements identification, management, and completion.
04:00:53	Meshach Barkley:	Just learned about PESTEL last week!
04:01:02	Jalisa Crutchfield:	Do these fall under EEFs? 
04:01:25	Joshua Ternes:	Did anyone capture the definition of an OPA
04:01:40	Ebrima Cham:	What is the most important skill of Agile Project Manager? 
04:01:56	TAYLOR Joy:	like an SOP?
04:02:18	Nathan Trotter:	@dell, i speaking more about persistent, real time dashboards for a sales org to track metrics, contests etc. it need stakeholder input and agreement 
04:02:22	Alexis Delapaz:	he is going fast
04:02:47	Hanna Pardee:	Project Managers tend to be involved with any aspect when it involves the timeline of the project (resource management, requirements, stakeholders) if it impacts the project somehow in terms of deliveiry, PM is probably involved
04:03:15	Dell Fletcher:	@Nathan that makes sense.

04:10:51	Erika Tarzi:	but historical regs are guidelines we have to follow
04:10:52	Andrew Zeigler:	What is key is the project
04:10:55	Denielle Poirier:	OPA
04:10:56	Joseph Bales:	it can be changed internally. It should be.a fluid concept
04:10:58	Julie Leong:	opa
04:11:05	Maliek Mckenna/PMP:	Main difference of OPA and EEf
04:11:06	Cynthia Lalicker:	wouldn't the historical society building regulations be documented?
04:11:06	Christopher Foss:	Tenent selection process - organization control it => OPA
04:11:17	Sean Byerly:	Erika, the key word is  "society"
04:11:25	Sean Byerly:	This is not part of the organization
04:11:26	Andrew Zeigler:	You say tenant selection but what if it has nothing to do with our project?  How would that be an OPA?
04:11:28	Jessica Masters:	Wouldn't guidelines be documentation too?
04:11:29	Erika Tarzi:	sSean - thanks
04:11:29	Jalisa Crutchfield:	Its an OPAs because it does really impact the project because the centre is still going to be built regardless of the tenant selection 
04:11:44	Catherine Gutierrez:	How are laws and regs not considered documentation?
04:11:44	Jalisa Crutchfield:	Trying to simplify it for my brain lol 
04:11:54	Alice Delp:	the process has impact to project- EEF
04:11:57	Azizza Brown:	is there any instance both can be applicable?  
04:12:07	Marco Egizi:	Tenant Selection Process is up to us in the situation, right? Rather than being regulated by external factors?
04:12:17	Christopher Foss:	Oh, I missed that those were with respect to the Life Style center we discussed in the beginning
04:12:33	Andrew Zeigler:	I think it is a bad example but I will not argue it
04:12:38	Brandon White:	tenet selection is probably a guideline
04:12:41	Sean Byerly:	Organizational documentation!
04:12:46	Jeffrey Greenwood:	Everyone was throwing in different answers...can you please just list out the answers for the 6 questions on pg 65
04:12:46	Cynthia Lalicker:	but you said that b was an EEF?
04:12:56	Ebrima Cham:	Does a project always need to have a PM?
04:13:01	Benjamin Giovingo:	yes, internal/organizational docs.  not external factors
04:13:07	Hanna Pardee:	For c. local neighborhood is EEF because its a social/cultural influence right?
04:13:07	Lydia Iantosca:	Can someone repost the answers to A thru F
04:13:10	Sean Byerly:	Keep in mind it depends on if it is internal or external to your organization.
04:13:22	Dell Fletcher:	Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy. Documentation
04:13:26	Sean Byerly:	If internal documentation = OPA
04:13:28	Brandon White:	if your organization makes that requirement it is internal
04:13:36	Sean Byerly:	If external documentation = EEF
04:13:39	Derek Likes:	I was thinking the Tennant requiremnts were a Regulation or Standard for the Area expected -  Law regulation or Standard?
04:14:00	Jeffrey Nagle:	OPA, something that we make up and document from past experience to guide us in future projects and levy requirements on us. EEF, something that is out of our control that still has impacts on our project or procedures.
04:14:06	Brian Barksdale:	Section 2.2 and 2.3 PMBOK guide outlines greater detail on OPA and EFF.
04:14:13	Audrey Arvin:	it seems like organizational culture could be an OPA as well? bc it can be influenced by the org.
04:14:14	Nicholas Spitler:	"documentation" = OPA
04:14:22	Omobolanle Kayode:	If we are just working on the building for example, selecting tenants won’t be an OPA right?  We won’t have power over that, the customer would even though its a process. Or am I wrong?
04:14:25	Dylan Costello:	Correct Audrey
04:14:27	Brian Barksdale:	*EEF
04:14:44	Sean Byerly:	Culture is a state of mind and controled by actions of multiple members.
04:14:56	Tara Niscak:	So the reason to distinguish between OPA and EFFs is to better understand where you have leverage and where you dont?
04:15:02	Benjamin Giovingo:	Employee guidelines, mission statements, etc. that influence culture would be OPA
04:15:03	Hanna Pardee:	Culture isn't documentation 
04:15:06	Sean Byerly:	You cannot always control how a person acts. As he said that's when the policies come into play.
04:15:06	Robins Ramirez:	Audrey, yes, but it would be in OPA if it was in the company/org policy
04:15:11	Brandon White:	culture is a shared set of norms and beliefs
04:15:12	Saranya Azhagamanna Hariharan:	Organizational culture on EEF and Organizational charts on OPA is quiet confusing, Please help to understand
04:15:18	Sean Byerly:	Mindset = EEF
Policy = OPA
04:15:24	Elizabeth Jackson:	culture guidelines/expectations is documentation
04:15:29	Robins Ramirez:	@Brandon, 100%
04:15:30	Dana Parisi:	So if you are consulting, would your client's policies and procedures still be an OPA or would that be an EEF?
04:15:42	Kai Cao:	A document from ISO is EEF? a document derived from that within an organization is OPA?
04:15:46	Dawn Sherman:	OPAs are processes, policies, and procedures. EEF is environmental. Culture would be an environmental factor. Yes, it can be influenced but we don't have any power over culture is formed/adapted/modified by staff --> human choice
04:15:51	Andrew Warninghoff:	Enterprise Environmental Factor = EEF
04:15:54	Reim Emam:	can Orlando read the question so that we know what he is replying to?
04:16:00	Ronald Maddalena:	wouldn't tenant selection exist after the project
04:16:13	Sean Byerly:	Dana, do you have control over your client's policies.
04:16:14	Sean Byerly:	?
04:16:16	Maria Hannah Dalit:	Policies like equal opportunity access/anti discrimination are externally influenced too, correct?
04:16:31	Delan Humphrey:	Are we saying here that OPA's and EEF's need to be identified before the start of the project?
04:16:34	Maria Hannah Dalit:	Like it is law what processes tenants go through
04:16:35	Dell Fletcher:	OPA. Enlisted personnel will have separate barrack lodging from Officers. That is a policy. OPA
04:16:49	Benjamin Giovingo:	Dana: you are a resource to the client's project.  The client's P&Ps are their OPAs
04:17:16	Dragos Zamfir:	@dELL, NOT IN THE AIR FORCE
04:17:16	Delan Humphrey:	Are we saying here that OPA's and EEF's need to be identified before the start of the project?
04:17:17	Alice Delp:	culture outside environment (OPA). CHART is internal as to organizational list. Internal EEF.
04:17:27	James Simpson:	Are not laws, regulations and standards documented?
04:17:32	Dawn Sherman:	Maria - those are laws, so those would be EEFs
04:17:37	Quincy Blunt:	F: organizational charts are like a task org in an OPORD
04:17:41	Matthew Ong:	comes back to documentation
04:18:06	Elaine Romain:	but there can be a place where they both meet and you see both Org OPA and Org EEFs?
04:18:07	Priya Ranjan Tripathi:	Working style, Emplyees value, 
04:18:08	Alice Delp:	just changed my chat. thank you
04:18:16	Veladri Palla:	how is IT software and EFF
04:18:21	Dell Fletcher:	That makes sense @Quincy. Documentation. It is written somewhere.
04:18:45	Elaine Romain:	but there can be a place where they both meet and you see both Org OPA and Org EEFs?

04:18:50	Devanand Jayapaul:	Does the OPA's be part of ITIL
04:18:58	Brian Barksdale:	Section 2.2 and 2.3 PMBOK Guide (6th) outlines greater detail on OPAs and EEFs.
04:18:58	Abdulrahman Al-Zahrani:	is OPA and EEF required in Agile ?
04:18:59	Alice Delp:	is it correct to say that OPA and EEF is the second step of getting to know your project as a PM?
04:19:00	Dell Fletcher:	You need to know what EEFs may affect your project before it begins.
04:19:01	karunanithi kandasamy:	also it is ongoing right?
04:19:12	Ebrima Cham:	So will Procurement Plan management fall under OPA?
04:19:23	Dawn Sherman:	To clarify, federal laws are EEFs but our organization's policies related to those laws are OPAs, correct?
04:19:36	Gwendolyn Dedrick:	The example of the historical society requirements- that's an external EEF?
04:19:44	Veladri Palla:	HOW IS RESOURCE  CAPABILITES A EEF
04:19:45	Andrew Warninghoff:	Would OPAs be used to frame a scope and scale?
04:19:50	Amber Dean:	So Opas are always internal, and EEFs can be internal and ecternal?
04:20:09	Christina Harrison:	Can EEFs and OPM be in the same organization?
04:20:12	Manish Bansiwala:	How many questions we will have on EEF and OPA ?
04:20:15	Dell Fletcher:	You are building a new building. EEF could be a civil protest in the area where the building is being built. Social and cultural influence could delay the project finish date. Civil protest are not in documentation.
04:20:16	JESSICA FOURNEY:	if your project is a government project would the laws, regulation and standards be OPAS? 
04:20:17	Keith Wilson:	Example of internal EEF
04:20:18	Veladri Palla:	BUT THE RESOURCE CAPABILITIES INFLUENCE THE PROJECT CAN CAN BE CHANGED RIGHT?
04:20:23	Sean Byerly:	Is this the final subject before lunch break? If not, can we move on?
04:20:32	Azizza Brown:	an EEF can change an OPA?
04:20:40	Robert Morgan:	how is IT software a EEF, when it is documented and defined in  our PMO guidlines
04:21:18	Teisha Akinpelu:	Situational
04:21:23	Robert Morgan:	how is IT Software a EFF, when it is documented and defined in our pmo guidleines
04:21:25	Hanna Pardee:	Basically: OPAs are documentation, processes, and policies within the project. EEFs are outside of the project that impacts the project in some way
04:21:40	Delan Humphrey:	Can give us an example of how this would be asked on the exam?
04:21:47	William Mitchell:	@ Hanna: Good Summary
04:21:57	William Mitchell:	All: Don't over-think it.
04:22:19	Sindy Alcantar:	organizational culture can be controlled within the organization.  can you give an example please
04:22:23	Nestor Daniel Vivas Contreras:	Can you give an example of a scenario given in the test? or type of question testing this topic? 
04:22:46	Ashwyn Kumar:	Enterprise environmental factors (EEF) and organizational process assets (OPA)
04:22:48	Kai Cao:	@Henna, but procurement rules are also out of project that impacts the project
04:22:49	Meshach Barkley:	Agree - Don't overthink. Processes, policies and procedures in your company...hopefully at some point you can add some input or suggestions to change...OPA
04:23:53	Carl Mullin:	Chat is paused. We will be playing a video on loop for attendance.
05:27:17	Orlando Sequera:	Github link: https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5Day
05:27:32	Carl Mullin:	Non-Percipio and Percipio Users: You can access documents including the session slides and attendance tracker from GitHub.https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5DayClick Code and then Download Zip to get all resources from GitHub.
05:28:25	Carl Mullin:	I do not hear an echo. You may want to exit and rejoin
05:29:38	Carl Mullin:	When you post in the Q&A you should see your name. You shouldn't have to test your name every time you rejoin using the same join method.
05:34:44	Meshach Barkley:	What is an example of stakeholders in your current role as a PM?
05:34:46	Erika Tarzi:	why only quantifiable?
05:34:53	Devon Callahan:	can you review the epa and opa please
05:35:18	Ebrima Cham:	Provide an example of a project without any value creation ?
05:35:37	Erika Tarzi:	says value is only quantifiable - why?
05:36:11	Kazeem Arowolo:	WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ATTENDANCE TRACKER?
05:36:37	Justin Aiken:	would an "update" be considered a creation without "new" value
05:37:09	Gregory Whitmarsh:	If you can't quantify value, how do you justify spending resources on a project? What is the return on investment?
05:37:10	Paula Blackford:	Meshach, for me these are engineers, architects, Right of way specialists, Inside plant engineers, construction coordinators, etc
05:37:45	Silvia Ramirez Suarez:	IS the business value part of the scope? How do we keep it in front of the team at all times?
05:38:03	Luca MAGNANI:	what do you with "Channel"?
05:38:07	Luca MAGNANI:	"mean
05:38:07	Sean Byerly:	Meshach Barkley
A stakeholder is anyone that has a stake in the projects successful completion.
05:38:23	Henry James:	Can employees need help with understanding who the stakeholders are?  
05:38:23	Andrew Warninghoff:	Value is as a Measure of Performance is then established by whom?
05:38:40	Meshach Barkley:	Thanks Sean. I do get that though, but just wanted a hard picture. 
05:39:18	Hector Gonzalez Perez:	How to measure an intangible value?
05:39:32	Hanna Pardee:	I like to think that value is quantiable - numbers certainly help frame that "value" i.e 85 training materials created, 8% increase in profits, 200+ resources managed 
05:39:33	Maria Hannah Dalit:	So for a project building a website - one of the values it provides is easy access to the list of services, it is quantifiable by the completion of a product directory being published?
05:39:37	Teisha Akinpelu:	Would that be in the project charter?
05:39:41	Sean Byerly:	Meshach Barkley
You as a PM are a stakeholder, customers are stakeholders, personnel resources that will work on the project are stakeholders.
05:39:48	Steven Cragg:	So would a Brand or reputation count as an intangible value?
05:40:03	Teisha Akinpelu:	Would business value be discussed in the project charter?
05:40:11	Jean Luc Kersulec:	is business value the responsibility of the project manager?
05:40:16	Sean Byerly:	Yes, that's basically what I said about a stakeholder.
05:40:23	Ronald Maddalena:	Let's let the instructor instruct!!!
05:40:32	Hector Gonzalez Perez:	How to measure an intangible value?
05:40:34	William Mitchell:	I recommend holding questions to the end of each presentation so we do not get ahead of ourselves - I think we are derailing the process
05:40:38	Daniel Zinoviev:	^ this
05:40:44	mary clement:	Please turn off chat.
05:40:50	Kevin Arroyo:	^
05:40:54	Eric Prosser:	^
05:40:54	Candice Martin:	This chat is too much; can we disable so you can move forward with instructing?
05:40:55	Cheyenne Gutierrez:	Agree with William
05:40:57	Robins Ramirez:	@william 100%
05:40:58	Brian Barksdale:	What is a "Channel"?
05:41:01	Curtis Freeman:	Agreed
05:41:04	Dana Sosa:	Agree everyone.  PLEASE ask questions related to the content being presented.
05:41:09	Cade Moses:	yes!!
05:41:13	James De Los Santos:	Concur with wm
05:41:27	Christopher DeJesus:	What is the zoom meeting passcode?
05:41:43	Luis Ramos:	This chat is very distracting. Can we dedicate time to answer the chat at the end of each lesson. It's slowing the training down. 
06:16:16	Elizabeth Jackson:	What are some examples of implementing incremental value delivery?
06:16:17	Erika Tarzi:	is the icremental value delivery only relevant to adaptive model?
06:17:10	Philip Dittmer:	does the PM have a role in defining and measuring the value of the project, or does the PM simply execute the project as directed by the organization? 
06:17:16	Sonia Thakur:	I missed the earlier part of the session today, Can i get the recording for todays session?
06:17:23	Alice Delp:	as to the incremental value delivery is this a phase in the process of determining a project. or is this already in the scope of a project and these are the tasks that need to be developed to ensure a quality product for increasing market value.
06:17:26	Catherine Gutierrez:	Are OKRs established during needs assessment?
06:17:43	Nishant Sagar Purohit:	Kindly read the question fully and clear before answering, it will help us understating.  
06:17:50	Brian Schwartzkopf:	if project charter is done right the charter will help in making that determination
06:17:57	Dana Sosa:	It might make more sense to use the Q&A for content questions so we can up vote them and Orlando can answer the ones the get votes.  We don't have the ability to vote on the Webinar chat.  Flip flow how you're using them the two features :)
06:18:28	Hans Nygren:	Can the Q&A feed be reset? It is impossible to locate and read a response with 1400+ questions.
06:18:56	Ebrima Cham:	How does the Burndown Chart relate to incremental value delivery? 
06:19:00	JESSICA FOURNEY:	Agree so hard to vote on Q&A
06:19:12	Alice Delp:	I think you just said this as to the incremental value. and this slide is to support the framework for the 'approach' for agile and adaptive correct?
06:19:21	Abdulrahman Al-Zahrani:	can BA define business value ?
06:19:28	Robert Morgan:	You made the statment about we do not have to memorize formals. Is this a new Change. I was taking prep class before the change in 21, and there was a list of formuals we had to know to answer test questions
06:19:51	Sameh ElGendy:	what is the difference between PM and SDM? or PM has same objectives
06:20:00	Alice Delp:	 ok great. ongoing in project lifecycle. got it! 
06:20:14	Michael Miklos:	Can value evolve as the project works?
06:20:30	Christopher Foss:	(please don't read out for the class, this is only for you)  Thank you for your incredible patience. I don't know how you do it. 
06:20:53	Sameh ElGendy:	who is responsible for delivery PM or SDM 
06:21:01	Nadia Louise Capovilla Andrietta:	there are companies which work based on customer requests... how do this project selection apply to them in this case?
06:21:06	Brian Schwartzkopf:	Does Project Charter help inform the project manager the value of the project
06:21:17	Marta Nalik:	Isn't Project Manager one of Project stakeholders? 
06:22:20	karunanithi kandasamy:	is it good split large project into multiple project?
06:22:25	Abdulrahman Al-Zahrani:	can business analyst define business value when developing business case?
06:22:57	Alice Delp:	value is by stakeholder
06:22:58	Ebrima Cham:	Can the BA be considered as part of the project team 
06:23:19	Jeffrey Greenwood:	People need to turn their BLUE BOX to EVERYONE! Orlando is reading/answering questions that we're not seeing
06:23:33	NContreras:	T
06:23:58	Adam Heathman:	Thanks!
06:24:12	Akash Ranjan:	Do we have any Scope later for Value change in project? 
06:24:29	Cathe Alao:	Please what is ECO?
06:24:31	Bogahawattage Pasan Kularatne:	what does ECO stand for?
06:24:39	Erika Tarzi:	what are the delivery options? are they talking about the metrics?
06:25:10	Cathe Alao:	Exam Content Outline?
06:25:23	Robins Ramirez:	HOLY COW PEOPLE!!!
06:25:33	Darry:	lol
06:25:34	Ronald Maddalena:	HOSTS, we were instructed to direct technical difficulties to Q and A but are being asked to vote on content based questions that are supposed to be in chat but there is no option to vote in chat
06:25:40	Benjamin Giovingo:	he;s going to walk off 
06:25:44	Lawton Hill:	Future Project Managers!
06:25:51	mary clement:	^^

06:26:11	William Mitchell:	@Cathe: You can download from the resources tab on the IVMF PMP Bootcamp Channel
06:26:18	Robins Ramirez:	I'm literally spending more time hearing him repeat himself than learning!
06:26:21	Florina Paduraru:	no breaks?
06:26:24	Ozias Sanchez:	Mr. Sequera, if somebody is asking a question that's already been asked, then please just skip over it.
06:27:02	Hector Gonzalez Perez:	+1
06:27:03	Robins Ramirez:	He needs the break! Poor guy 
06:27:28	Ronald Maddalena:	^
06:27:29	Jesse Harrahill:	God bless you guys for dealing with all these people... 
06:29:16	Steven Cragg:	How likely are project managers drawn into office politics?
06:29:48	Alice Delp:	im taking away what our teacher is saying and see how it applied to me. valuable things here! thank you
06:29:49	Dylan Costello:	Can we please mute the chat for good when we return from break. We want to listen & learn. We can consolidate questions within the Q&A and answer the ones with the most votes at the end of the module. 
06:29:55	Justin Cepeda:	Thank you so far Orlando for your patience & your knowledge.
06:40:54	Robins Ramirez:	Welcome back orlando. Thanks for coming back!
06:40:58	William Mitchell:	Once more into the breach!
06:40:59	Jesse Harrahill:	Hellllo Orlando! You're doing awesome 
06:41:21	Janika Imafidon:	Thanks for your patience, Orlando!
06:41:28	Andrea Campbell:	Orlando you are a phenomenal instructor 
06:41:31	Thomas Radich:	please pause
06:41:38	Ronald Maddalena:	^
06:41:41	Francisco Pineiro:	YES pause when required.
06:41:48	Eric Jaeger:	We would like you to pause it until you have completed the lesson
06:41:51	mary clement:	vote for no chat
06:42:02	Robins Ramirez:	NO CHAT
06:42:03	Sunil Ghatage:	Please Pause, it distracts
06:42:12	Janika Imafidon:	You can turn the chat off. Nothing good is happening in here.
06:42:15	Jason Taylor:	Please pause both; over 30% of the folks in here are still struggling with the housekeeping hour we had.
06:42:17	Ebrima Cham:	No chat during the lecture
06:42:19	Robins Ramirez:	until 10 min BEFORE break
06:42:30	Ozias Sanchez:	That's a good idea
06:42:31	Sindy Alcantar:	he just said what is up, please stop as this is just as distracting. just ignore the chat like I do. 
06:42:33	Paula Blackford:	This poor guy spent all this time repeating himself, he will soon loose his voice
06:42:37	Marco Egizi:	You're doing a great job!
06:42:38	Melanie Ivey-Bunnell:	Yes robins. please pause until 10 mins before break for 'clarifying questions'
06:42:49	Delan Humphrey:	Exactly, just create a parking lot for questions
06:42:49	Valérie Carbonneau:	to stop de music in the break : in the bottom left side of your screen click on audio setting. and click leave computer audio @Ryan Dunkle
06:42:50	Reim Emam:	can we vote for pausing the chat
06:43:01	Francisco Pineiro:	pause chat until 10 min before break
06:43:09	JESSICA FOURNEY:	agree
06:43:31	William Mitchell:	Concur with 'Pause' recommendations...though this is definitely entertaining...
06:44:01	Andrew Shryock:	Please pause the chat it's too distracting to break every 5 mins to stay on topic...
06:44:28	Marco Egizi:	👨‍🎓lets be good students!
06:44:48	Adam Tegerdine:	Im 100% for pausing the chat, but using the Q&A is horrendous, any guidance on using it?
06:45:18	Andrew Boynton:	agreed
06:45:30	Shaun Arner:	For tomorrow, can we move general chat/technical issues to the chat and leave Q&A for just content-related questions? With 1400+questions, I really can't find anything to be able to up-vote it.
06:45:35	Scot Wailes:	Enough with the chat conversation.  How will you manage a hectic project if you can't focus on a simple presentation with a chat window.
06:46:00	SCOTT SLATON:	Can’t wait until tomorrow's class.
06:46:07	Reim Emam:	I agree with Shaun and if people are still having tech issues that's sad
06:46:14	Armad Todd:	i trust the system
06:46:15	William Mitchell:	Concurr @Shaun 
06:46:18	Darryl George:	I agree as well
06:46:19	Wyatt Pierce:	I also cannot get value from the Q&A. It scrolls so fast nothing stays put and I can't even resize the window. I won't be upvoting anything there.
06:46:33	Carl Mullin:	Chat is paused.
06:47:04	Carl Mullin:	The recordings won't be available for 24 to 48 hours after the session.
06:47:45	Carl Mullin:	So asking in the Q&A now, won't help to get them. You can ask tomorrow or email mentoring@skillsoft.com 48 hours after the session ends.

06:58:25	Daniel Zinoviev:	lol
07:00:03	Seth Harrison:	Orlando, you said that the PMO would provide the best update for the organization's culture. What if your assessment of the organization does not align with that due to key players withholding information
07:00:41	Nathan Trotter:	I saw in the QA that someone mentioned their platform allows them to sort the QA window. what platform is that?
07:01:09	Juliana Osuoha:	@Orlando My laptop was frozen for a moment and I missed your points on PMO
07:02:07	Juliana Osuoha:	Thank you
07:03:07	Buck Brunner:	EPPM Tools
07:04:04	Dana Sosa:	@Seth the last statement in your question say more about the culture of the organization than the PMO could ever provide!  You'll need to gather tribal knowledge from the people that have to work with that PMO!
07:04:42	Ronald Maddalena:	Can we please save the what ifs and hypothetical content and let the instructor instruct. HE is telling us jwhat we will be tested on
07:05:09	Pramod Itkar:	Are today's topic part of PMP exam

07:19:09	Marco Egizi:	Great tip
07:19:10	Tara Niscak:	Has anyone looked at Lisa Lahey's work on change? - I think her framework is worth considering for working through change management in both individuals and organizations. https://brenebrown.com/podcast/immunity-to-change-part-1-of-2/
07:19:18	Tanangachi Ngwira:	Can you do the exam after each session?
07:19:38	Manish Bansiwala:	Plz clarify the perspective - Organizational Change or Personal Change is to Manage ?
07:19:55	Anjumara Syed:	Can we get the recording?
07:19:59	Tara Niscak:	Has anyone looked at Lisa Lahey's work on change? I think her framework is worth considering for working through change management in both individuals and organizations.
07:21:26	Randy Cupit:	I do not see the test prep in resources in precipio
07:21:27	Ashwyn Kumar:	Pl. take question at end. Will missed important content .

07:25:46	Veladri Palla:	do giti has practice exams
07:25:58	Carl Mullin:	Chat paused
07:28:16	Carl Mullin:	IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Everyone should track their time in the attendance tracker. The attendance tracker is needed when using the certificate request process to get your certificate. If for some reason your attendance isn't perfect and you cant get your certificate using the self-serve option, which is only available to Percipio users, then you will need to use the certificate request process to get your certificate. Percipio users should always check the self-serve option fist before using the Certificate Request option.
07:28:58	Carl Mullin:	And by checking, that means after the last session has ended.
07:38:13	Carl Mullin:	It's basically a backup for Percipio users.
07:38:31	Carl Mullin:	And always needed for non Percipio users.
07:39:18	Carl Mullin:	The options are discussed in the Certificate video which we will play on Friday.
07:39:40	Carl Mullin:	You also have access to the Certificate video in your Bootcamp resources.
07:46:44	Carl Mullin:	If you check out GitHub, you will see a Lunch Break Videos where you can learn about the certificate options from the Day 5 video
07:47:46	Carl Mullin:	IMPORTANT NOTICE - If you have missed more than 15 mins today, we are offering an additional exception that can be made up by watching on Replay.
07:48:46	Carl Mullin:	So you can make up this session and one other session by watching both on Replay.
07:49:11	Carl Mullin:	Of course we don't recommend that you miss anytime if at all possible.
07:55:35	Carl Mullin:	Chat unpaused
07:56:05	Mark Thompson:	Thank you for the additional exception.
07:56:31	Kristy Guede:	When will those be posted in Replay? I didn't miss more then 15 min howver, things were spotty this morning and I'd like to recap those parts
07:56:37	Ebrima Cham:	Can you have two  PM's on a project 
07:59:13	Joshua Kim:	To clarify, on replay means the recording that will be available by emailing the mentor team after 24-48 hrs?
08:00:05	Carl Mullin:	Chat paused
08:01:13	Carl Mullin:	For the question on the Replay, please re-watch the Day 1 video under Lunch Break Videos in GitHub.
