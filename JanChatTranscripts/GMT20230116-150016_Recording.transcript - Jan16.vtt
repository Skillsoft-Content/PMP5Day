214
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:48.509
Orlando Sequera: unfortunately not every question is going to be answered again. Great questions are related to the content that we're covering

215
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.479
Orlando Sequera: at that particular time. Those are great questions.

292
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.599
The following information is specific: to pmp attendance for the five-day cohort

293
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:09.150
You may be wondering is live attendance required for the five-day cohort.

294
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:22.579
Your live attendance is required. If you plan to register for the Pmp. Exam plan to submit this training for Pdus to maintain your pmp certification, or require an official pdu certificate.

297
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:57.050
Let the recording play from start to finish. But you must watch any parts you missed.

298
00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:06.850
If you miss more than 15 min. In any additional sessions you will have to make up those missed sessions by attending live in a different five-day cohort.

299
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:12.390
The following information is specific to pmp attendance for the eight-day cohort.

300
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:19.860
like the five-day cohort, live attendance is required for the eight-day cohort, based on the situations referenced

305
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:21.269
Of course things happen, and you may find yourself in a situation where you must miss all or part of a boot camp session in case of an absence. These are the recommended steps. If you miss more than 15 min in a live session, you must make it up according to the previous slides

306
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.669
based on the boot camp type. You are attending 5 day or 8 day.

307
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:43.650
You can request a replay for a previous session by asking during a live session in the Q. And a. Or for a past or current session by emailing the mentoring team 48 h after the session ends using the email address, mentoring@skillsoft.com

308
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:53.300
A replay for a session also referred to as a session recording requires you to use the link and pass code provided by the mentoring team.

309
00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:07.370
When accessing the recording. Please use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. If possible, you will be brought to a registration page where you will need to enter your first and last name and any other required fields.

310
00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:16.910
After you have registered, you will need to enter the pass code. Remember, the pass code is case-sensitive, and must be entered exactly as provided.

311
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:25.219
In addition, the replays or recordings are available upon request for the dates of the boot camp you attended for study purposes.

312
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:34.859
since attendance is so important for this boot camp, and required by Pmi for candidates taking the pmp. Exam or claiming this boot camp for Pd. Us.

313
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:43.560
Anyone in either of those situations must use the provided attendance, tracking sheet included as part of your boot camp resources.

314
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.910
Also, if you require an official pdu certificate, you will need to fill out the attendance tracker.

315
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:55.610
In this example we are showing the first 2 tables from the attendance tracker document.

316
00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:02.019
The first table is used to indicate the title for your boot camp and the scheduled start and end dates.

317
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:13.180
The second table is only used, if you must attend, live to make up missed sessions beyond the allowed exception, as discussed for the 5 day and 8 day cohorts.

318
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:17.850
In this example we are showing the session template table for day one.

319
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:26.579
the attendance tracker, dox, file contains 8 tables one for each session. If you are attending the five-day cohort. You can delete

320
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:34.579
eat the extra tables. If you are attending the eight-day cohort, you will use all 8 tables

321
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:46.010
in this version of the attendance tracker columns with choose and item allow you to pick from the available items for consistency, and to reduce the guessing on your part as to what to fill in

322
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:54.290
for this feature. To work you must click, enable editing from the information bar you see at the top, after opening the document.

323
00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:03.619
if you don't see that information bar, and the items are not clickable. You can find a description of each column in the attendance tracker dox file.

324
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:12.469
In this example, we are showing the Comments section. The Comments section is used to add additional information that can't be captured in the table.

325
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:27.489
For example, if you want to expand on the reasons for joining late and or leaving the session early. You can provide these details if needed for one or more sessions. If you do not have any comments. You can leave the Comments Section blank

326
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:35.899
for detailed instructions on filling out the attendance tracker, including an example. Please check for the attendance tracker, Doc. X. File

327
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:49.640
to locate the attendance tracker dox file for Cpio users. Please check the resources option in your boot camp channel, and non-persipio users please request the link to Github to locate the file.

328
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.970
The name will be similar to the following, and may include the revision: date.

329
00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:01.789
Pmp. Boot camp 5 day and 8 day attendance, tracker and certificate request process.org.

330
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:09.310
One commonly asked question is, Can you confirm my attendance for a certain date, time or session.

331
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:18.670
Attendance is not verified on a per session basis. If you are in class and logged in with your first and last name, the reporting will be accurate.

332
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:30.479
Please track your attendance, using the attendance tracker provided in your boot camp resources. Your attendance will be verified at the end of the cohort during the certificate request process.

333
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:43.449

401
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:04.879
Orlando Sequera: the second requirement.

402
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.310
Orlando Sequera: each candidate that is intending to sit for the Pmp Exam. Needs to have

403
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.560
Orlando Sequera: a learner. Kit.

404
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:14.450
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So we're going to watch a second video

405
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.109
Orlando Sequera: about the learner Kit.

406
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:40.489
In this video we will discuss the Pmp. Learner Kit, also known as your student Kit.

407
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:49.320
the Learner Kit, is produced and maintained by the Project Management Institute or Pmi, and it is tailored to the Pmp. Exam.

408
00:39:49.450 --> 00:40:04.609
It includes a series of supplemental assets for your Pmp. Studies, such as a student workbook, checklists, videos, knowledge checks and the Pmi slides used in your Pmp. Exam. Prep. Training class or boot camp.

409
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:15.539
Let's start with the student workbook under student materials. The student workbook contains 350 pages, and it will help you to prepare for the Pmp. Exam.

410
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:33.469
This student workbook is aligned with the 35 h of instructor-led training that are provided in your Pmp. Boot camp. The Pmp's student workbook is divided into 6 sections which Pmi calls lessons. The first 2 lessons are business environment and start the project

411
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:44.910
lessons. 3 and 4 are planned. The project and lead the project team lessons. 5 and 6 are support project team performance and closing the project or phase.

412
00:40:44.990 --> 00:41:01.530
This content aligns directly with the Pmp. Exam. Content Outline, which is found under student resources in your learner, Kit. Next, we'll talk about the student resources. When you click on this you will be presented with 4 different links, including a glossary

413
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:09.219
mastery Builder. Questions: a project case, study, and the Pmp. Exam. Prep. 3 course outline

414
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.969
the learner kit is required only for those who register for the Pmp. Certification. Exam.

415
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:21.069
You do not need the learner Kit to take a course for professional development units or pdus.

416
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:26.280
Take a course to learn about project management or complete your Pmp application.

417
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:36.309
You do need the learner Kit, to follow the pmi and skill soft recommended steps, and demonstrate that you are working with an authorized training partner or atp.

418
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:47.310
When Pmi reviews your Pmp. Application. They will review your education, your work, experience, and your 35 h of project management, classroom learning.

419
00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:58.720
Since the learner Kit, is tied to an authorized training partner, Pmi, will know that your project management education was delivered by an organization that has been approved by Pmi.

420
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:12.790
We have referred to the term authorized training partner or Atp throughout this video, and you may wonder what is an authorized training partner. Pmi-authorized training partners are organizations that Pmi has approved

421
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:21.910
to offer project, management, professional or Pmp. Certification. Exam. Prep. For the Pmp. Exam. As well as disciplined agile training.

422
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.279
All authorized training partners are required to guide their students to Pmi's Pmp. Learner. Kit.

423
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.650
Please note that each Pmp. Student must have their own learner. Kit.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:11.819
Orlando Sequera: A Pmp. Exam.

506
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.760
Orlando Sequera: What are the requirements? They need your requirements?

507
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.140
Orlando Sequera: This comes directly from Pmi.

508
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.140
Orlando Sequera: If you have

509
00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.319
Orlando Sequera: a 4 year degree

510
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.600
Orlando Sequera: from a college or university.

511
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.099
Orlando Sequera: then you need to be able to show proof

512
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:47.520
Orlando Sequera: of having been able to lead projects for 36 months, 3 years.

513
00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.830
Orlando Sequera: hey? 3 years

514
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.290
Orlando Sequera: and you have to complete

515
00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:52.900
Orlando Sequera: a 35 h

516

519
00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:18.310
Orlando Sequera: a 4 year degree college? And I started to see some questions in the chat. Remember that that's not the place for questions. Questions. Go in the Q. A.

520
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:26.119
Orlando Sequera: If you don't have a 4 year degree college you, if you have a high school diploma or an associate degree.

Orlando Sequera: And

602
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:11.679
Orlando Sequera: the link to the actual learner, kid. It's Pm: I don't know if it's.

603
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:15.689
Orlando Sequera: Bm: I don't know a lot choice.com

604
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:16.490
Orlando Sequera: all right.

605
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:19.099
Orlando Sequera: So we are going to.

606
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.930
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue.

607
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:23.189
Orlando Sequera: And

608
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.250
Orlando Sequera: now

609
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:28.319
Orlando Sequera: we're going to talk a little bit about the Pmp. Exam: so this is important.

610
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.180
Orlando Sequera: This is important. We need your attention here.

611
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.140
Orlando Sequera: The Pmp. Exam

612
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:35.069
Orlando Sequera: covers

613
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.569
Orlando Sequera: multiple approaches that you're going to find in

614
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.310
Orlando Sequera: project management.

615
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.479
Orlando Sequera: These approaches go from

616
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.669
Orlando Sequera: predictive.

617
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.100
Orlando Sequera: Probably

618
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.630
Orlando Sequera: most of you know it authorization or project management

619
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.959
Orlando Sequera: or waterfall.

620
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:51.960
Orlando Sequera: but it also

621
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.430
Orlando Sequera: covers

622
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:59.009
Orlando Sequera: as active approaches, which probably most of you know, as agile approaches.

623
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.370
Orlando Sequera: and then a combination of the 2

624
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.080
Orlando Sequera: combination of predictive and adaptive.

625
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.980
Orlando Sequera: which is what we call a hybrid approach.

626
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.700
Orlando Sequera: Hey?

627
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.419
Yeah.

628
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:13.370
Orlando Sequera: So Pmi covers Bmp exam covers all that spectrum.

629
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:24.399
Orlando Sequera: You're gonna have a meaning that you're gonna have questions associated with predictive. You're gonna have questions associated with adaptive. And you're gonna have questions that are associated with a combination of the 2.

630
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.810
Orlando Sequera: These change happened in 2,021 to really

631
01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:31.589
Orlando Sequera: a adjust

632
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:40.589
Orlando Sequera: or update the the exam to the current reality that that is being faced by most organizations they working.

633
01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:58.740
Orlando Sequera: Those are in that spectrum. Some of them follow a predictive approach. Some of them follow an adaptive approach, and some of them follow a combination of the 2, so to reflect the current reality. Pmi decided to update the content to that to reflect that new reality, meaning that

634
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:10.779
Orlando Sequera: by going through this content you're gonna learn tools that are gonna help you to navigate those approaches. Okay, and the breakdown of your Pmp. Exam. Is as follows.

635
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.020
Orlando Sequera: We have 3 domains. We have 3.

636
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.119
Orlando Sequera: The first one is the people domain

637
01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:21.899
Orlando Sequera: that goes. It talks about the team and

638
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:36.960
Orlando Sequera: a also of our stakeholders. We're going to cover a lot of that, and that is going to be 42% of your exam. 42 of the 180 questions are going to be related to the people domain. Then we also have the process domain. This is about

639
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:48.910
Orlando Sequera: your ways of working, and it covers both predictive and adaptive. And of course, hybrid. 50 of the questions are going to be related to that. And then Probably the new element.

640
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:50.869
Orlando Sequera: I would say.

641
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:57.060
Orlando Sequera: would be business environment. These only accounts for 8%

642
01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:02.509
Orlando Sequera: of the questions. But it is important. A basically we're.

643
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:22.540
Orlando Sequera: Why do we have to take into account the actual external environment and the internal environment, or the organization, and gives you an idea where projects come from and all those links, because projects are not done in a vacuum. So 8% of the questions are going to be related to the business environment. So that's the breakdown of your

644
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.890
Orlando Sequera: Pmp. Exempt

645
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.380
Orlando Sequera: right a. Before we go on our first break.

646
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:39.909
Orlando Sequera: I will also like to mention something that is extremely important. And this is

647
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:46.560
Orlando Sequera: this going to address a nervous legend, a common misconception out there

648
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:59.310
Orlando Sequera: that people tend to think that the Pmp. Is aligned with the PIN, but that is an exam solely based on the PIN. But guide, which, by the way, the latest edition is the seventh edition. That is not the case.

649
01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:06.459
Orlando Sequera: The Pmp. Exam is based on the exam Content outline, which, by the way.

650
01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.899
Orlando Sequera: it's one of the resources that you have.

651
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:17.849
Orlando Sequera: whether it is in per sepio or Github, you have access to that exam. Content outline. That is the syllabus of your exam.

652
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.610
Orlando Sequera: Those are the topics that you're going to be testing on.

653
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:27.260
Orlando Sequera: Okay, those are. If you want to know. What am I going to be tested on the Pmp. Exam. It's not the pinball guy.

654
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.919
Orlando Sequera: It is the exam Content outline.

655
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:33.310
Orlando Sequera: This was created by Pmi

656
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.129
Orlando Sequera: using

657
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:39.859
Orlando Sequera: a global selection of project managers from multiple industries

658
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.830
Orlando Sequera: that gave their input

659
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.950
Orlando Sequera: in regards to what they thought a project manager should know

660
01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:58.750
Orlando Sequera: A. E. When it comes to doing the job, including experience and other basis concepts. So this is what you're gonna be tested on. If you want to know today day one.

662
01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.069
Orlando Sequera: And this is a little bit of an example.

663
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:18.080
Orlando Sequera: This is again your syllables of your exam is broken by the 3 domains that we talked about before

664
01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.390
Orlando Sequera: people.

665
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:24.109
Orlando Sequera: 42 of the questions are associated with the people domain

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:24.990
Orlando Sequera: them

667
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:30.689
Orlando Sequera: process 50 of the questions. So 90 questions are going to be associated with process

668
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.750
Orlando Sequera: in then business environment, which is

669
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:40.580
Orlando Sequera: 8% of the questions. Okay, you're going to see multiple tasks

670
01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.789
Orlando Sequera: under each domain. And those are the topics that we're going to be covering in this

671
01:05:46.830 --> 01:06:03.609
Orlando Sequera: but 5 day boot time session. We're gonna go over managing conflict that is related to people how to work with people. That's a huge component. That's an important topic. I'll make sure that I highlight that when we get to that section of the Content leading a team supporting team performance. This is what you're gonna be test

672
01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:07.900
Orlando Sequera: tested on in the Pmp. Exam scenario questions that are going to

673
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:19.699
Orlando Sequera: allow Pmi to determine whether you know how to apply these concepts when it comes. Or these definitions in a practical environment. Okay, most of the questions are going to be scenario based. They're not

674
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:26.780
Orlando Sequera: testing your knowledge on the definitions. They're testing your knowledge on the application of these definitions. Okay.

675
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:47.000
Orlando Sequera: I see some questions. Where can we find the extent content outline? It's under the resource resource, Tab. We have it in there. It's it's one of the resources. You can go directly to pmi.org, and you can get it from there as well. Then you you will go to certifications, and then you can also get it a under

676
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:56.959

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:07.469
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna now, I see a question before we go on the break. Let's go over the references.

679
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.780
Orlando Sequera: These are the references.

680
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:15.039
Orlando Sequera: or that are used for the Pmp. Exam. As you can see here.

681
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:22.890
Orlando Sequera: it's more than just the PIN book. The PIN book is one of them. We have 10 different rest references. We have the agile Practice Guide.

682
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.050
Orlando Sequera: We have

683
01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:35.070
Orlando Sequera: the team book, 6 edition and seventh edition is still relevant. There is information in the 6 edition about the process groups and about the

684
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:41.570
Orlando Sequera: If the the different the different processes, the 49 processes that is still relevant and applicable.

685
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:48.530
Orlando Sequera: And of course, the seventh edition is that was just released not too long ago. That is one of the references.

686
01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:57.990
Orlando Sequera: but it's more than that. You have Dr. Curtis Kirner's book about project management. You have multiple multiple references.

687
01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.870
Orlando Sequera: but the beauty of it is

688
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:08.870
Orlando Sequera: that all this content is a distilled version of all this over 5,000 pages

689
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.310
Orlando Sequera: of

690
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:14.520
Orlando Sequera: content that you will have to go through. So this is a distill version.

691
01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.470
Orlando Sequera: What what we're going to be going over in this

692
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:22.819
Orlando Sequera: 5 days is that they still version of all this content. Okay, so

693
01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.610
Orlando Sequera: it. The other practice guide

694
01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:28.329
Orlando Sequera: important covers all the agile aspects.

695
01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:29.629
Orlando Sequera: The PIN book guy

696
01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:35.900
Orlando Sequera: still available in Pmi standards plus, and the seventh edition. That's the pinball guide

697
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:50.509
Orlando Sequera: a important, but they're not the only ones. They're not the only ones. If you want to know what you're going to be tested on is the Exam. Content outline. Okay, that's what you have to review the Exam. Content outline.

698
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.029
Orlando Sequera: That is

699
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:56.980
Orlando Sequera: the main takeaway from this portion of this section.

700
01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:16.899
Orlando Sequera: I see questions about the exam content outline you. Ha! If you're a percipient user that's one of the resources you have it on the resources. If you're not a procedure. You can go to Github, and it's going to be one of the resources in the folder, or you can go directly to pmi.org

701
01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:27.160
Orlando Sequera: and go to Pmp on their certifications, and you can get it directly from the source from the Pmi itself. Okay, 3 ways that you can get it

702
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:28.500
Orlando Sequera: all right.

703
01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:30.840
Orlando Sequera: I

704
01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.620
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna take a break. We're gonna take our first break, and we'll be back in 10 min.

705
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:49.010
Orlando Sequera: We are back

706
01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.139
Orlando Sequera: as a chat or

707
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.519
Orlando Sequera: all right

708
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.500
Orlando Sequera: we are going. We were mentioning before we went and break, that

709
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:16.619
Orlando Sequera: the Pmp. Exam. Is not based only on the pinboard guide.

710
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.670
Orlando Sequera: It is based on

711
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:23.800
Orlando Sequera: multiple references. Here's the list of the references that you need to

712
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.530
Orlando Sequera: that you need to follow.

713
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.830
Orlando Sequera: But they

714
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:33.060
Orlando Sequera: we have some good news. This content is that is still version of this

715
01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.199
Orlando Sequera: 10 references that you see on your list. Okay.

716
01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:44.749
Orlando Sequera: that is the value of working with an authorized training partner like skill soft in this case it is important.

717
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.400
Orlando Sequera: It is important to keep in mind

718
01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.920
Orlando Sequera: I

719
01:10:50.400 --> 01:11:02.930
Orlando Sequera: one thing that I wanted to mention, that I wanted to bring up to your attention again the recommendation. If you're having a lot of audio issues, please use the zoom login information

720
01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:22.279
Orlando Sequera: if you need to get to your resources and you are a procedure. User you want to. How do I get the exam company outline? How do I get the tenants tracker? Go to the resources, Tab, as we show before in per sepio, and it's going to be there so you can click on the the the tab as I showed previously.

721
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:36.860
Orlando Sequera: And you're gonna have the list of resources. What do I do? If if I am I? I am not a a percipient. User what do I do? What can I get to the resources? The answer is, yes. Use Github to get to the resources

722
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:47.269
Orlando Sequera: You're gonna be able to get to a folder, and the same resources are going to be available for you to use all the resources that you need for the class. Okay.

723
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.210
Orlando Sequera: all right.

724
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:56.550
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with the content. And

725
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:04.660
Orlando Sequera: so these are the 10 references.

726
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:05.320
Okay.

727
01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:09.260
Orlando Sequera: let's talk about the exam. And I saw some questions before

728
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:10.770
Orlando Sequera: about the exam.

729
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:15.950
Orlando Sequera: Are all questions multiple choice. That was one question that I I saw in the Q. A.

730
01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:30.500
Orlando Sequera: The short answer is, No, most of them are, but they sure answer is no. How many questions do we have in the Pmp. Exam. We have a total of 180 questions, so it's a 180 questions.

731
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.200
Orlando Sequera: How much time do I have to complete the Pmp. Exam. You have

732
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.519
Orlando Sequera: 230 min

733
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.110
Orlando Sequera: to complete the exam.

734
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.019
Orlando Sequera: Jake.

735
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:43.199
Orlando Sequera: That means that you have

736
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:46.549
Orlando Sequera: 3 h and 50 min

737
01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.869
Orlando Sequera: to complete the exam.

738
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:49.930
Orlando Sequera: A 180 questions.

739
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.130
Orlando Sequera: One

740
01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:58.409
Orlando Sequera: addition the Pm. I made to the Pmp. Exam. Is that they incorporated breaks.

741
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.510
Orlando Sequera: I can

742
01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.100
Orlando Sequera: back in the day when I took my Pmp. Exam. No breaks were part of the

743
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:20.880
Orlando Sequera: part of the exam, the actual exam experience. There were no breaks, so you had to account for. You had to build your time. Manage your time wisely. There were no breaks now. Pmi has incorporated 2 10 min breaks

744
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.270
Orlando Sequera: it so.

745
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.510
Orlando Sequera: And it's basically they have divided the exam. And this is the way it works

746
01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:33.630
Orlando Sequera: in sections of 60 questions every 60 questions. So

747
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:40.629
Orlando Sequera: when you're getting close. Question Number 60. You're gonna get the option of taking a 10 min break.

748
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.309
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so you will have to submit

749
01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:53.149
Orlando Sequera: that section before you take your 10 min break. These 10 min breaks are no mandatory. They are optional. You don't have to take them.

750
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:57.580
Orlando Sequera: My recommendation is for you to take them.

751
01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:12.869
Orlando Sequera: It is important. It will give you a chance to reset, so you can go a to the bathroom to the restroom, grab a snack, bring some water that's gonna give you a chance to reset. I encourage all of you to take your optional 10 min breaks.

752
01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:18.229
Orlando Sequera: When you come back from break You're gonna start in the next set of 60 questions.

753
01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:19.889
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So it will be questions

754
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:27.060
Orlando Sequera: if it's your first break. When you come back from your first rate, you're going to start. Question 60 all the way through. Question 120,

755
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:31.409
Orlando Sequera: and then you're gonna get the option to take a second 10 min break

756
01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.469
Orlando Sequera: and do the same reset and then

757
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.400
Orlando Sequera: come back.

758
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:37.540
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

759
01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.900
Orlando Sequera: that is gonna be Section number 2. But before you go on that break you have to submit

760
01:14:44.310 --> 01:15:01.350
Orlando Sequera: that set of questions. Questions. Sixth. Section B or section 2. Do you have to submit it? You can go back to that previous section when you come back from break. So then you come back from your second break, and you start working on questions a 120 through 180,

761
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:05.889
Orlando Sequera: and that'll be the end of your exam. So it's basically 3 sections.

762
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:11.040
Orlando Sequera: and that you are going to be able to

763
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:19.219
Orlando Sequera: to have those breaks. And even if you take it from. So you can take the exam from home. That's what they call online Procter. You'll have

764
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.559
Orlando Sequera: this breaks.

765
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:22.349
Orlando Sequera: Or if you go to a

766
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.410
Orlando Sequera: a center-based test.

767
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:31.610
Orlando Sequera: You also have a Pearson view. That is the testing Provider organization

768
01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:33.150
Orlando Sequera: used by Pmi.

769
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:50.459
Orlando Sequera: So you if you go to a PE PE Pearson View testing Center, you will have a the chance to take the actual breaks. But if you have a paper based exam, which I think probably that's is that will be the exception of most places are computer based tests that you can take.

770
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:56.560
Orlando Sequera: They, unfortunately have no breaks. But most people are gonna be either online proctor from home, or

771
01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:04.869
Orlando Sequera: you're gonna have the chance to go to a testing center and let's go back to the questions. The type of questions that you're going to be facing.

772
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:20.810
Orlando Sequera: I see some questions in the chat about the type of questions. Most of them are multiple choice with one right answer, but some of them might have multiple right answers, which is what they call multiple response.

773
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.309
Orlando Sequera: Big

774
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:42.270
Orlando Sequera: 3 they make. They give you, for example, a 5 options, and then they ask you, pick 2, or pick 3, or choose to choose 3 out of 7, for example. So you might have more than one than one right Answer. That's a perfectly fine a. Or do you have multiple choice? They give you 4 options and pick one

775
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.550
Orlando Sequera: or questions in which you're going to have to match.

776
01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:49.450
Orlando Sequera: That's a

777
01:16:49.910 --> 01:17:06.979
Orlando Sequera: They give you a, for example, a definition, and then they give you a box, and then you're gonna have to match a that box. With that definition that might be the case, Not many of those what it happens, or they might also have questions about what they call hotspots.

778
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:13.090
Orlando Sequera: which is basically an example of that will be. They give you a graph of a process

779
01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:32.209
Orlando Sequera: in this is related to quality right? And they might ask you, can you pinpoint where this process is out of control? So you will have to find out the area or where that process is out of control. That's just an example or questions in which you have to fill in the black. So you basically have

780
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.220
Orlando Sequera: 5 type of questions, but

781
01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.410
Orlando Sequera: they

782
01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:53.870
Orlando Sequera: on official data that we have been gathering is that most of the questions are multiple choice. The questions are scenario based. They're going to be scenario based, and it's a majority. They're not questions about definitions. That is the cap and exam. Remember that the Pmp. Exam. Is

783
01:17:53.970 --> 01:18:01.329
Orlando Sequera: testing your ability to apply these definitions. This concept is not testing you on.

784
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:07.460
Orlando Sequera: How well do you know the definition of what you know the formulas? No. How well you know to apply

785
01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:16.239
Orlando Sequera: these formulas, these definitions, these concepts that we're covering. That's what they're looking for application. And that's why the questions are situational

786
01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:19.350
Orlando Sequera: in in most cases. Okay, so please

787
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.609
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you remember that for the Pmp. Exam.

788
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:32.840
Orlando Sequera: I am going to answer some of the questions in the Q. A. If I may and

789
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:35.599
Orlando Sequera: hmm.

790
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:40.940
Orlando Sequera: When I

791
01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:49.319
Orlando Sequera: if an interview does not pass the exam on the first try of their options to retake the exam absolutely. But there's going to be a cost involved with that

792
01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:54.920
Orlando Sequera: goal is for you to follow this preparation. So you are successful in your first try. You want to

793
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:56.710
Orlando Sequera: just once.

794
01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.120
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

795
01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:01.499
Orlando Sequera: a another question that I see here when

796
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.240
Orlando Sequera: when writing the Pmp. Exam. Who

797
01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:11.219
Orlando Sequera: sorry they keep

798
01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:13.980
trying to

799
01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.710
Orlando Sequera: go to the top

800
01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:21.040
Orlando Sequera: out of a 180 questions.

801
01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.479
Orlando Sequera: do all counters passing, or some of them future questions.

802
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:33.620
Orlando Sequera: assume that all of them, Count Pm. This is a password. That's a good question. This is a pass or fail, Exam. So assume that every single question counts.

803
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:48.550
Orlando Sequera: because even if they have questions that are not taken into account to the score, you don't know that we, you don't know which questions are those. So assume that every single question counts. Answer them to the best of your ability, and, more importantly, answer every single question.

804
01:19:49.180 --> 01:20:03.350
Orlando Sequera: Okay, every single question. Do not leave any questions on answer. Can you mark for review and come back later? Yes, you can do that, but make sure that you answer every single question before so meeting your

805
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:04.870
Orlando Sequera: answers.

806
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.110
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

807
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.670
Orlando Sequera: the path.

808
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:18.919
Orlando Sequera: The what is the past threshold that is prepared to information for Pmi. It's a password fell. Exam: Nope. We nobody knows. Whatever You see out there is gonna be unofficial.

809
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:22.870
Orlando Sequera: A passing rates for Pmi does not publish their passing rates.

810
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.220
Orlando Sequera: Okay? What other questions

811
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:30.629
Orlando Sequera: for more information on the questions

812
01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:44.099
Orlando Sequera: you can download. They have sample questions from Pmi directly. I will go to pmi.org, and they have a document. I'm not sure if we have it on the resources. But there is some information about the questions. I will

813
01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:47.359
Orlando Sequera: strongly suggest you to review that information.

814
01:20:50.580 --> 01:21:06.489
Orlando Sequera: Will the system notify you? Which questions you have not be answered? No, no, you gotta go back and review and make sure you stop, you have to make sure that you do that. Make sure that you, if you have any questions smart for review, make sure that you answer those questions before you submit your exam.

815
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:18.100
Orlando Sequera: Another question about resources. Do we need to have experience in hand? An industry project? Remember that it's not industry. Specific project management can be. These principles can be applied to any industry.

816
01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:27.570
Orlando Sequera: It's about using this this definitions in, and 36 months of leading projects that's directly from Pmi.

817
01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:29.990
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

818
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:37.120
Orlando Sequera: right.

819
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:45.599
Orlando Sequera: Passing passing percentage. Nobody knows it's a password fill. Exam: Pmi: that's not published. They're passing right. So that is not

820
01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:47.120
Orlando Sequera: a

821
01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:59.740
Orlando Sequera: That's only up to Pmi, but you will know right away. Once you submit the last section the last set of 60 questions. You will know whether you pass right away in a matter of seconds. They're going to give you a con a message.

822
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:11.539
Orlando Sequera: Actually, they're gonna ask you to fill out a survey, and then they're gonna give you the message on whether you passed or or failed, the Exempt, and they'll give you your performance based on their domains.

823
01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:24.429
Orlando Sequera: A. But it's not a numeric performance. They're going to give you whether you were below a target target or both target in the 3 domains. So that's all. That's what they give you

824
01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:25.580
Orlando Sequera: all right.

825
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:40.899
Orlando Sequera: Another question that I see here are you allowed to have anything with? You know Everything that you need is gonna be provided at the testing center, or and if you're taking it from home, your work area has to be

826
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:50.780
Orlando Sequera: clean. Everything that you will need is it's gonna be in the session. So no, nothing. Everything has to be clear.

827
01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:04.849
Orlando Sequera: Post example. Pm: I give access to this question. Nope.

828
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:13.300
Orlando Sequera: that's a no. They will give you a report on how you date on that particular domain, but they're not going to give you a specifically which question.

829
01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:14.889
Orlando Sequera: All right.

830
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:16.389
Orlando Sequera: A.

831
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:23.720
Orlando Sequera: How can you get ready for the Pmp. Exam.

832
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.000
Orlando Sequera: A.

833
01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:27.979
Orlando Sequera: First of all, I will

834
01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:32.990
Orlando Sequera: only suggest you to review the official site. Go to pmi.org

835
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:48.589
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna expand on the exam prerequisite some of these general questions that some of you might have go to pmi.org under certifications, and then go to Pmp. And all that in the detailed information is going to be available

836
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:56.470
Orlando Sequera: in there. Okay, the exam prerequisite. You're also going to have an access to the Exam content now.

837
01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:05.180
Orlando Sequera: and they also expanded the Pmp. Exam in your Pmp. Handbook. That's also important information that you're going to be

838
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:06.480
Orlando Sequera: a there.

839
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:15.009
Orlando Sequera: How can you be successful? Heimed your Pmp: exam. For

840
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:27.140
Orlando Sequera: this is gonna and do because some of you might have this question. I'm surprised that I haven't seen this question yet in the Q. A. How long does it take in average to get ready for the Pmp. Exam.

841
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.969
Orlando Sequera: My experience, my experience, my the data that we have been gathering

842
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:35.179
Orlando Sequera: I tend to

843
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:44.440
Orlando Sequera: agree with the 100 h anywhere between 80 to 100 h. That's a good average. What I personally would say that is closer to a 100 h

844
01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:48.840
Orlando Sequera: that is gonna take you to get ready for the Pmp exam.

845
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:52.190
Orlando Sequera: That is, on top of the 35 h

846
01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:54.059
Orlando Sequera: That you are.

847
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:58.280
Orlando Sequera: That You have to dedicate for this class. So where do you start?

848
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.590
Orlando Sequera: You can start either

849
01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:10.370
Orlando Sequera: by watching him per CPU the 35 courses for the Pmp. 2,021 update, which is the most up to day version of the Pmp exam.

850
01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.660
Orlando Sequera: or you can start with.

851
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:17.320
Orlando Sequera: So you can start in any order okay that you have

852
01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:18.240
Orlando Sequera: a

853
01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:23.009
Orlando Sequera: these 35 courses that are also going to help you to solidify

854
01:25:23.610 --> 01:25:33.960
Orlando Sequera: your knowledge of the different topics that we're covering for the Pmp. Exempt but remember, it is a must you have to take this class

855
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:43.949
Orlando Sequera: in order to get to to meet one of the requirements for your Pmp. Exam just watching the recorded content is is not enough. Okay? So you can start either way.

856
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:55.999
Orlando Sequera: And then you also have another extremely important resource that I that is going to answer. I saw that some of you were asking about mock exam questions

857
01:25:57.090 --> 01:26:12.079
Orlando Sequera: in prosecution. You have access to test prep. This is a very important resource that is going to allow you to take practice questions, mock exams, questions that were written by Pm. By certified P. And P.

858
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:13.879
Orlando Sequera: That are very that are

859
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:19.219
Orlando Sequera: very close to what you're going to be facing in your actual Pmp. Exam.

860
01:26:19.410 --> 01:26:20.219
Orlando Sequera: So.

861
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.769
Orlando Sequera: but it's gonna take you an average.

862
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:27.189
Orlando Sequera: I would say a 100 h to get ready for the Pmp. Exam.

863
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.700
Orlando Sequera: Okay, on top of the 35 h that we're covering here with this class.

864
01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:41.440
Orlando Sequera: How long does it take? It it depends on your time availability, for some people can be 2 weeks. Most people, I would say, is gonna be a

865
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:55.130
Orlando Sequera: anywhere between 4 to 8 weeks. So a couple of months in average, I would say, depending on your availability. But it's pretty much how you allocate those a 100 h right? So, in a realistic

866
01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.500
Orlando Sequera: assuming that if you're working full time, etc., so

867
01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:03.289
Orlando Sequera: it's pretty much in average what's gonna take you to get ready for the Pmp. Exam.

868
01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.160
Orlando Sequera: all right.

869
01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:16.749
Orlando Sequera: I see questions about the passing grade. This is a pastor failed. Exam. There's not a passing grade. This is exam is not great. It is a pass or failed. Exam.

870
01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:17.679
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

871
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:33.140
Orlando Sequera: A. I'm. Reviewing the questions in the Q. A. There is another question about Where is the test? Prep. It's in for CPU go to percipient on the resources it is in persecuted. You have access to desperate. That is an important.

872
01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.480
Orlando Sequera: a resource. So you can take your practice questions.

873
01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:41.469
Oh, yeah.

874
01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.339
Orlando Sequera: i'm trying to

875
01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:49.630
Orlando Sequera: trying to re the questions. And

876
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.529
Orlando Sequera: do we need to pass all 3 sections? No.

877
01:27:55.250 --> 01:28:00.240
Orlando Sequera: they it's a whole exam, even though it's broken down into sections. It's still one exam.

878
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:04.030
Orlando Sequera: The precipio include

879
01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.080
Orlando Sequera: the

880
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.719
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Going over the questions

881
01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:18.650
Orlando Sequera: you need to pass all section it all we need to pass. We need to. It's a Yes. You have to perform well in all 3 sections to pass the Pmp. Exempt.

882
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.250
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

883
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:51.360
Orlando Sequera: Book coming off study wise to pass the exam. It covers all the content. But remember, we have resources. That's why we're highlighting the importance of the resources you need to go over your exam content outline. You need to review your learner, Kid. All the resources are going to be available to you

884
01:28:51.490 --> 01:28:54.190
Orlando Sequera: A. As well. So it's.

885
01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:01.410
Orlando Sequera: It's this plus using the resources and taking the practice questions as much as possible.

886
01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:02.620
Orlando Sequera: All right.

887
01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:09.800
Orlando Sequera: okay. Let's go ahead and continue. This is the breakdown of

888
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.579
Orlando Sequera: the next 5 days we're going to get into content.

889
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:20.860
Orlando Sequera: This is a breakdown of the next 5 days, and this is a sequence that we're going to follow for our class.

890
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:24.409
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna start talking about business environment.

891
01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.639
Orlando Sequera: And this is the foundational aspect of project management.

892
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:30.559
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna help us to understand

893
01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:36.510
Orlando Sequera: a that philosophical aspect that foundational aspects, some business concepts

894
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.309
Orlando Sequera: that are important for a project manager to know. We're going to start with that.

895
01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.099
Orlando Sequera: Then

896
01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.860
Orlando Sequera: number 2. We're going to be talking about what we need to

897
01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:51.980
Orlando Sequera: to cover and to know when we start our projects.

898
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:54.280
Orlando Sequera: This is the pre-planning stage

899
01:29:54.630 --> 01:30:04.140
Orlando Sequera: a and basically what we need to have in mind about the stakeholders, the team, how to build that share understanding about what we're trying to do with our project

900
01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:15.770
Orlando Sequera: and decide also what's gonna be the best approach. Should we follow a predictive approach? Should we follow an agile approach? Should we follow a hybrid approach? So that's what happens

901
01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.690
Orlando Sequera: in that particular point. In time

902
01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:34.359
Orlando Sequera: we start in the project. Then we're gonna go and start talking about planning the project. This is where, as a project manager, this is what we do. For the most part this is: we're gonna spend most of our time. We're gonna go through the different steps.

903
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.709
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna be playing this. Co: the schedule budget, different areas of our project

904
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:43.000
Orlando Sequera: and resources, risks, quality, etc.

905
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:47.639
Orlando Sequera: That's what's gonna happen in plan the project. And that happens

906
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:56.440
Orlando Sequera: whether we're following a predictive approach or an agile approach. We we're going to be spending some time in planning. Then the next lesson is

907
01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:18.080
Orlando Sequera: about leaving the team we have to, we we're gonna be basically mainly focusing on your leadership skills. Remember that in most cases you're gonna be leading the team. It's not about directing the team. You're not telling them what to do. You have to lead the team to produce the outcome that is suspected from your project. So that's less on Number 4,

908
01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.569
Orlando Sequera: less on Number 5. We're gonna be going over

909
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:25.629
Orlando Sequera: supporting how to support your project team.

910
01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:28.899
Orlando Sequera: It's about performance. How can you get?

911
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:32.120
Orlando Sequera: How Can you help the team and guide the team in

912
01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:49.959
Orlando Sequera: achieving the best performance possible? Right? So that is about again leadership that is also working with them, and it's a lot of it's. It's related to that first domain that we mentioned for the Pmp. Exam. That's about people that's people the people domain. So

913
01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.130
Orlando Sequera: And then.

914
01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.809
Orlando Sequera: as we're going to see in the definitions.

915
01:31:54.460 --> 01:32:00.819
Orlando Sequera: a project is not an open ended endeavor. A project has a definitely beginning, a definite end.

916
01:32:01.290 --> 01:32:13.830
Orlando Sequera: What we have to understand how we close projects, what needs to happen in order for a project to to close what happens in closure. There are some important things I need to happen, but

917
01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:29.269
Orlando Sequera: projects always come to an end. Projects are, that's the main difference. By the way, between projects and operations operations are ongoing. They start when the organization starts a functioning, but they only end when the organization sees to exist.

918
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.370
Orlando Sequera: But

919
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:45.940
Orlando Sequera: projects are temporary endeavors. They start, and they end at a particular time, even if it takes, if it's not. By no means. I'm saying that they're short. They can take multiple years, but they have a definite beginning, and they have a definite, and so this is pretty much

920
01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.630
Orlando Sequera: the the roadmap that we're going to follow

921
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:52.490
Orlando Sequera: in the next 5 days.

922
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:53.449
Orlando Sequera: All right.

923
01:32:57.230 --> 01:33:08.950
Orlando Sequera: a a little bit of a guidance for the content that we're going to to follow some of the icons. You're going to see them multiple time. If you start seeing that those multiple arrows that is predictive.

924
01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:18.669
Orlando Sequera: we're talking about predictive right? Then adaptive or agile, the rotary and things. And that basically means that we do things multiple times.

925
01:33:19.190 --> 01:33:37.870
Orlando Sequera: And then, if you start, if you see one, that is the combination of the 2. That means hybrid. Okay. But we're gonna have some other icon. Some things are going to be important questions, discussions, etc. And one important aspect is the terminology, the vocabulary. That's why, at the end of it. It's

926
01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:48.540
Orlando Sequera: at the end of each section. We have vocabulary. That is important for you to master. Remember what I said at the very beginning. We all need to speak the same language

927
01:33:48.600 --> 01:34:01.170
Orlando Sequera: we need we, because in our organizations we might use different terminology. But for the Pmp. Exam. It is important that we come together, and

928
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:04.449
Orlando Sequera: language so it is important to

929
01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:10.569
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that we understand the the the terminology, the vocabulary for the Pmp. Exempt.

930
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:12.639
Orlando Sequera: Another

931
01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.629
Orlando Sequera: important aspect is that we have to go over.

932
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:22.589
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna have some case studies, and you have access to this in your learner, Kit.

933
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.850
Orlando Sequera: we're going to use some project examples. I want to try to bring some of my own as well. But

934
01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:33.119
Orlando Sequera: this is one case. Study that we have for this lesson

935
01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.590
Orlando Sequera: with a project manager, hem, fan, and we're gonna

936
01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:44.390
Orlando Sequera: go through his experience interacting with him and the correcting and stakeholder. And this is an actual

937
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:50.999
Orlando Sequera: hybrid project that is going to help us to reinforce the different concepts and the different

938
01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:57.869
Orlando Sequera: terminology and the different application of project management

939
01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:10.520
Orlando Sequera: definitions that we're gonna be going over with our content. Okay, so it's a it's gonna help us to follow along, and i'll. I'll try to incorporate a some examples as much as possible to illustrate the points that we're covering.

940
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:12.110
Orlando Sequera: Also

941
01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:23.850
Orlando Sequera: it for. And, by the way, this is the the we we're talking about shop industries. That is just a a a fictional company, and they do have a project. This is the project that that they have.

942
01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:28.009
Orlando Sequera: It is a lifestyle center for shop industries.

943
01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:30.279
Orlando Sequera: and they are.

944
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:42.579
Orlando Sequera: This is some of the background information. They're trying to develop a lifestyle center, probably close for those of you who has something close to a intergenerational center Y.M.C.A. Center

945
01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:47.369
Orlando Sequera: that in covers design and a currency of retail and community spaces

946
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:54.530
Orlando Sequera: A. And they have a development partner. They have an initial, a budget for this project some 1 million dollars.

947
01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.480
Orlando Sequera: and they have a 3 year timeline to complete this

948
01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:03.739
Orlando Sequera: project. So that is one of the scenarios that we're going to be using a throughout the class.

949
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:04.630
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

950
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:06.590
Orlando Sequera: again.

951
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:12.160

Orlando Sequera: and let's get started

1000
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:29.400
Orlando Sequera: less on Number one. These are these are the topics that we're going to be covering. This is about foundation.

1001
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.490
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be go going over strategic alignment.

1002
01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:35.650
Orlando Sequera: benefit some value.

1003
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:40.010
Orlando Sequera: Why do we work on projects? Why do organizations

1004
01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.329
Orlando Sequera: follow this project? Management approach?

1005
01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:49.670
Orlando Sequera: We're going to talk about the organization and culture culture of your organization and change management and the impact that

1006
01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:55.800
Orlando Sequera: those elements are going to have on your projects. We're also going to go over

1007
01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:00.300
Orlando Sequera: for the Government super important and project compliance. That's how

1008
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.150
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna wrap up a the content

1009
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.860
Orlando Sequera: we the goals that we have

1010
01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.740
Orlando Sequera: with this lesson.

1011
01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:16.780
Orlando Sequera: We want to make sure that all of you understand what a project is, and how relates to the larger discussion of project management.

1012
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:28.479
Orlando Sequera: the different type. We need to understand different types of organizational structures, the different types. And you're going to start seeing within that spectrum. Where can I place my own organization.

1013
01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:41.239
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna go over the principles of project management. And also we're gonna go over agile principles and how they relate to your project management. We're gonna go over strategic enlightenment.

1014
01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:48.809
Orlando Sequera: Why organizations have strategic goals, and how our projects relate to those goals that the organization has

1015
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:52.009
Orlando Sequera: the impact of business factors on strategic alignment.

1016
01:41:52.720 --> 01:42:05.269
Orlando Sequera: And then the Alli may being able to understand that alliance between our projects and the basis strategy, there is a reason why organizations are investing time and money on those a projects.

1017
01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:07.390
Orlando Sequera: We need to also understand

1018
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:16.439
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more of a value business value that is tied up to the definition of success of your projects. We're going to go over change Management Theory

1019
01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.790
Orlando Sequera: project Governance and Project Compliance.

1020
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:20.900
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1021
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:25.820
Orlando Sequera: So basically we are going to

1022
01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:31.579
Orlando Sequera: start with foundation. We're gonna go over these foundational concepts

1023
01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:44.349
Orlando Sequera: related to project management that, of course, are found on your pinbook. I we're gonna start with some definitions that are key that are critical for us to start a talking the same language.

1024
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.190
Orlando Sequera: Everything starts with the definition of a project.

1025
01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.399
Orlando Sequera: A project by definition is

1026
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:57.040
Orlando Sequera: a temporary endeavor.

1027
01:42:57.570 --> 01:42:59.009
Orlando Sequera: And what do I mean by that?

1028
01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:04.540
Orlando Sequera: It's an endeavor that has a definite beginning and a definite end.

1029
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.290
Orlando Sequera: It starts at a certain point in time, and it ends at a certain point in time. It's not ongoing.

1030
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:15.400
Orlando Sequera: It has a definitely beginning with different, and some of you might think

1031
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:16.260
Orlando Sequera: that

1032
01:43:16.450 --> 01:43:17.290
Orlando Sequera: by

1033
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:26.469
Orlando Sequera: me saying or using the word temporary being, that it is a sure endeavor that is absolutely not the case for those of you.

1034
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:35.159
Orlando Sequera: And, by the way, I should have done this before. I I know that many of you come from a some that are transitioning from the military

1035
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.369
Orlando Sequera: to to the civilian life.

1036
01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:39.769
Orlando Sequera: First of all. Thank you for your service.

1037
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:43.599
Orlando Sequera: Second of all, many of you can relate to this

1038
01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:49.540
Orlando Sequera: programs that the Department, the Us. Department of Defense has in place to develop

1039
01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:50.630
Orlando Sequera: class of

1040
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:55.510
Orlando Sequera: that can take years multiple years, 25 years, for example.

1041
01:43:56.270 --> 01:44:06.660
Orlando Sequera: But it has a beginning and it has an end, because it's definitely beginning it has an end. It's not ongoing. It's not forever. Okay.

1042
01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:13.139
Orlando Sequera: It has a definitely beginning, has some end, and the goal with the project is to create something that is unique.

1043
01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:15.349
Orlando Sequera: Whatever it is, it might be a product.

1044
01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.939
Orlando Sequera: maybe a service.

1045
01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:19.070
Orlando Sequera: or it might be a result.

1046
01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.410
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume, for example, that we are working on

1047
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:24.349
Orlando Sequera: your

1048
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:35.129
Orlando Sequera: A on a we're working for a construction company, and what we do is build houses just for build homes. Only one type of home we always build the same type of home.

1049
01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:46.719
Orlando Sequera: But even if that's the case each time that we're building each home, even though there's the same functional characteristics and same model it's each house is. It is is a particular project.

1050
01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:59.239
Orlando Sequera: Okay? So it is. Each house is unique, and they're gonna have, even though it is the same model. Each house has unique elements, different location, for example, a and and they're gonna have some differences, but

1051
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:01.380
Orlando Sequera: projects by definition are unique.

1052
01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:16.489
Orlando Sequera: their time limited. That's what what I mean by temporary endeavors. They have a different beginning of different and they drive change. They're going to be changing something. And, more importantly, for organizations. It's about creating value.

1053
01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:24.869
Orlando Sequera: either a business or an organization that the end goal of a project is to create value

1054
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:27.990
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to success.

1055
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:31.499
Orlando Sequera: There are multiple factors that come into play

1056
01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:35.089
Orlando Sequera: organizational project maturity

1057
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:38.040
Orlando Sequera: for your management, effective mess.

1058
01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.240
Orlando Sequera: available resources and available funding

1059
01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:47.290
Orlando Sequera: skill levels for team members, and then super important aspect.

1060
01:45:47.380 --> 01:46:06.519
Orlando Sequera: It's about collaboration. It's about communication key aspects that we're going to be covering in this content. So products can be successful. And also how well do we understand the core problem that we're trying to address with the project, and they need their associated with that project. So

1061
01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:09.709
Orlando Sequera: it is really important to keep that in mind.

1062
01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:29.180
Orlando Sequera: I see a common in the chat. Yes, projects are time. Limited operations are ongoing, but that is the difference. But they also have projects and operations have one element that is common to both of them. And you're going to see them overlapping, which is resources. The project resources, are

1063
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:42.699
Orlando Sequera: they? They're also gonna be working in supporting operations. So that's one element that both projects and operations have in common, which is resources. And that's why it it's something that we have to to keep in mind. Usually

1064
01:46:43.090 --> 01:46:53.020
Orlando Sequera: projects project resources are also gonna be working in supporting operations. So we have. We're gonna go over all of that. Okay, so they have differences, and they also have

1065
01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:55.339
Orlando Sequera: they? They also have

1066
01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.719
Orlando Sequera: similarities, as well

1067
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:59.110
Orlando Sequera: remember.

1068
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.750
Orlando Sequera: try to use the chat for the

1069
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.460
Orlando Sequera: for, comments a. And

1070
01:47:05.630 --> 01:47:10.329
Orlando Sequera: let's use the Q a. For questions for it to topics.

1071
01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:15.449
Orlando Sequera: and i'll try to address that. But you there's a question that I would like to address.

1072
01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.830
Orlando Sequera: What if a project is not successful?

1073
01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:23.709
Orlando Sequera: Your organization is going to have some criteria for that and the good.

1074
01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:30.850
Orlando Sequera: and If you have a Project Management organization in place of Pmo, they're gonna have. They're gonna help you with that as well. But the goal is to

1075
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:33.290
Orlando Sequera: follow that criteria

1076
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:35.059
Orlando Sequera: and try to

1077
01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:38.739
Orlando Sequera: A, and and they'll have. You'll be able to make adjustments

1078
01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:58.549
Orlando Sequera: to help your project throughout the life cycle of your project to make it a successful project. You're gonna have the chance to do that. That's part of what we do as project managers. We are this towards some for project, and if we start seeing that things are going sideways, we can make adjustments. So you will have the opportunity to to do that. Okay.

1079
01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:18.670
Orlando Sequera: there's another question. What if a project was cancelled due to environmental factors? That's the end of life of the that's the end of the project. That that's it. It's that's that's one way it that can happen that probably will be closed, and that's the end of life for that project at that particular moment.

1080
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:26.430
Orlando Sequera: Okay, let's keep. Let's keep the questions related to the topics. Okay, let's keep the questions related to the topics that we are covering.

1081
01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:30.799
Orlando Sequera: and let's go over that a little bit of the evolution

1082
01:48:31.810 --> 01:48:33.479
Orlando Sequera: of project management

1083
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.290
Orlando Sequera: back in the sixties. That's when

1084
01:48:38.290 --> 01:48:43.159
Orlando Sequera: think about that. But that's where everything everything started to

1085
01:48:43.470 --> 01:49:00.409
Orlando Sequera: pretty much come up as a both as an art or as a science. This systematic approach that's when Pmi started actually in 1,969, and try to provide a framework for project management as a discipline is

1086
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:06.000
Orlando Sequera: pretty much a as some authors define. Project management is both an art and a science.

1087
01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:08.590
Orlando Sequera: But if the application of

1088
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:19.179
Orlando Sequera: knowledge that you learn through experience, skills, tools, and techniques. So you can produce a. To meet the project requirements. That's where it started. But now

1089
01:49:19.390 --> 01:49:22.540
Orlando Sequera: fast forward to 2,022. They

1090
01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:24.730
Orlando Sequera: organizations are more

1091
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:40.149
Orlando Sequera: sophisticated. The environments that we are facing are changing constantly, constantly, and the level of complexity has increased exponentially. So it's not just about producing an output.

1092
01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.820
Orlando Sequera: buddies about

1093
01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.859
Orlando Sequera: adding value, making sure that those

1094
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.299
Orlando Sequera: outputs that we produce with our project deliver value to the organization of stakeholders

1095
01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:52.989
Orlando Sequera: in the past.

1096
01:49:53.730 --> 01:49:55.139
Orlando Sequera: A very

1097
01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.910
Orlando Sequera: common definition of success was

1098
01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.109
Orlando Sequera: was the project deliver on time

1099
01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:03.700
Orlando Sequera: complete, the scope that was agreed upon.

1100
01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:16.650
Orlando Sequera: and the if the answers within budget within the budget that was a that was approved, for they they, if the 3 answers were yes, projects were considered successful. But now it's more about

1101
01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:20.439
Orlando Sequera: did that value, because organizations are getting smarter.

1102
01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.399
Orlando Sequera: and there's time they're starting to realize that it's. Oh, it's not just

1103
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:26.660
Orlando Sequera: a project can be delivered on time

1104
01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.219
Orlando Sequera: within budget

1105
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:48.159
Orlando Sequera: and covering all this code that was agreed upon. But did it really at value? So they're adding that extra element that is the the most important aspect, the the at business value, the that value. So that's the evolution for management. Organizations are looking at adding value, and we're going to start seeing that

1106
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:54.959
Orlando Sequera: Co. Coming my more to the forefront throughout the content. But it's a very important aspect that we have to keep in mind.

1107
01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.469
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1108
01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.290
Orlando Sequera: We have

1109
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:07.059
Orlando Sequera: different life cycles, different approaches that we can follow for

1110
01:51:07.890 --> 01:51:09.219
Orlando Sequera: a

1111
01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:10.490
Orlando Sequera: for project management

1112
01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:15.760
Orlando Sequera: mentioned before. You might be wondering what are those symbols. The first one is.

1113
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:18.389
Orlando Sequera: what is the first one that we see that the arrows

1114
01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:22.760
Orlando Sequera: what what is that? Does anybody remember? And please feel free to use the chat

1115
01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:25.439
Orlando Sequera: predicted. Correct is predictive

1116
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:29.560
Orlando Sequera: plan based approach. We have to plan.

1117
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:36.650
Orlando Sequera: and then the plan drives the project right, and our performance has to be aligned with the plans.

1118
01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:44.040
Orlando Sequera: and the new face is only going to start when we completed the previous face. This works really well in many industries.

1119
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:57.709
Orlando Sequera: construction being one of them. I. It works really well, by no means. We're saying that this is not a good approach in some project situations. This is going to be the best approach some of the key roles. We have the sponsor.

1120
01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:02.250
Orlando Sequera: the individual that is going to authorize the project and the teams are going to be led.

1121
01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.670
Orlando Sequera: Remember that lit

1122
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:05.059
Orlando Sequera: leadership

1123
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:07.139
Orlando Sequera: by the project Manager

1124
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:08.160
Orlando Sequera: M.

1125
01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:16.839
Orlando Sequera: What happens is that after projects are completed we're going to be transition. What we produce within the project to the custom

1126
01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.349
Orlando Sequera: at completion. That's what we call deliverables, right? That's what we produce

1127
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.619
Orlando Sequera: with the project for the project. Life cycle delivers

1128
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:42.089
Orlando Sequera: that house that is spilled if we're building it, the progress to build a house when we start installing the windows, completing the floor, completing the structure as we go through the life cycle that those tangible elements that are being produced by the project work being done by the team. Those are our project delivers

1129
01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:42.980
Orlando Sequera: in

1130
01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.659
Orlando Sequera: the value can be realizing

1131
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:57.740
Orlando Sequera: in the short term, and also in the long term when the entire product is being completed. So that is predictive, that is, waterfall that is traditional. All of them are are equivalent.

1132
01:52:58.170 --> 01:53:00.059
Orlando Sequera: Okay, then.

1133
01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:03.800
Orlando Sequera: we have the next one, the rotary, remember.

1134
01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.999
Orlando Sequera: and that means that it's done multiple times in iterations. That is the agile approach.

1135
01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:18.680
Orlando Sequera: This is a change based approach in if we're following the magic approach in situations in which we know

1136
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:19.639
Orlando Sequera: that

1137
01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:28.710
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna be experience experiencing multiple changes or in situations in which there is a high level of complexity.

1138
01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.730
Orlando Sequera: We know that

1139
01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:51.579
Orlando Sequera: we know the End goal where we're trying to produce, but we don't know how to get there, so if that means change, so it goes back to change, so it's a change base approach that is going to help us to navigate complexity. We navigate situations in which we know multiple that we're going to be facing multiple changes. You might be

1140
01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:52.869
Orlando Sequera: A.

1141
01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:57.980
Orlando Sequera: You might be thinking, Well, can you give us some examples? Absolutely.

1142
01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:05.390
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume for a second that we're trying to build a spaceship to go to

1143
01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:06.980
Orlando Sequera: to go to Mars.

1144
01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:08.929
Orlando Sequera: That's very complex.

1145
01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:26.449
Orlando Sequera: Hasn't. Been done before. Well, by definition, probably is unique, but that's there's a lot of complexity, right? And we're we're trying to come up with a new, a technology for for rocket engines, for example, something complex that has some been done before. That means that we're going to be. We need.

1146
01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:42.959
Orlando Sequera: We need an approach that is flexible enough to make changes that it's going to allow us to make core. We're going to be changing course. Course direct e it. We're going to have to maneuver through a lot of changes, right? We can have an approach that is rigid.

1147
01:54:43.290 --> 01:54:44.150
Orlando Sequera: Daddy

1148
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:56.969
Orlando Sequera: doesn't allow us to manage change in a flexible way. We're going to be experiencing multiple changes. Okay, so that's when we use an agile approach when the scope is really complex. Or.

1149
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:59.879
Orlando Sequera: for example, when we are

1150
01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:12.259
Orlando Sequera: it it doesn't have to necessarily be very complex. But we we are. That's why Agile is so popular in software development. For example, look at whether you're an Android user or an iphone. User

1151
01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:21.190
Orlando Sequera: Your mobile app is another example. These mobile apps are driven by your by customer.

1152
01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:34.970
Orlando Sequera: but by by by customer expectations and customer preferences. And that means a lot of changes, right? And that's why every week or every 2 weeks or every few days. In some cases we started seeing updates updates

1153
01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:43.539
Orlando Sequera: in in your in in the app store. Right? So we have. We have this update that is going to help you to navigate this there that does change. So.

1154
01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.149
Orlando Sequera: in order to navigate a situation in which

1155
01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:52.280
Orlando Sequera: there is a high number of changes that's. When this is going to be your best bet

1156
01:55:52.550 --> 01:56:02.640
Orlando Sequera: your you for it's better to follow at change-based approaches. Not a plan based approach a change based approach is going to help you to navigate those changes in a more efficient way.

1157
01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:03.389
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1158
01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.799
Orlando Sequera: the rolls, the key rolls. Here

1159
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:09.240
Orlando Sequera: we have a product owner, which is

1160
01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:18.709
Orlando Sequera: customer representative, is a liaison between the pro, the the project team and the stakehold, their stakeholders. The business

1161
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:34.120
Orlando Sequera: that knows really well about the scope of the project is the this tour of the scope, basically, and it's also going to control the value proposition that you have the project team in the bill that are going to be working on the project. You have

1162
01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.790
Orlando Sequera: your the people doing the work, and then you also have a team lead

1163
01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:44.129
Orlando Sequera: A. Do you have your a scrum, master? If you're following

1164
01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:49.380
Orlando Sequera: scrum approach? That's not the only a flavor of agile.

1165
01:56:49.450 --> 01:56:50.170
Orlando Sequera: but

1166
01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.840
Orlando Sequera: it's the most popular.

1167
01:56:51.970 --> 01:57:02.300
Orlando Sequera: It would you might have a coach, and you might have a facilitator which are closely aligned to what the project manager will do, and the way things are done

1168
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:03.380
Orlando Sequera: is

1169
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:13.319
Orlando Sequera: I' they're gonna be a little bit different. We work in what is called iterations or in scrum. They're known as print. We deliver insurance

1170
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:26.789
Orlando Sequera: iterations anywhere from one to 4 weeks. Most organizations use a 2 week duration for the iterations, and that's where they start building those deliverables, and they get transition quicker.

1171
01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:40.039
Orlando Sequera: Who they they get that functionality gets released in a in a, in a constant, in in a constant way to the basis so they can start using it. They don't need to wait until the end. The entire functionality

1172
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:43.119
Orlando Sequera: Bill. Right? We can deliver an increment

1173
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:54.230
Orlando Sequera: align to what? To the functionality that adds the most value to the customers, and by working in those those short iterations and gathering that feedback.

1174
01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:04.970
Orlando Sequera: That's how we can make, we can change course. We can make corrections as needed. Okay, that's how we can navigate change. I'm. Going to review

1175
01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:08.880
Orlando Sequera: a few of the questions before

1176
01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.610
Orlando Sequera: a few of the comments.

1177
01:58:13.050 --> 01:58:17.639
Orlando Sequera: The first approach is called a waterfall. Yes.

1178
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:19.800
Orlando Sequera: adaptive is agile. Yes.

1179
01:58:20.190 --> 01:58:21.689
Orlando Sequera: predictive is rigid

1180
01:58:22.570 --> 01:58:24.449
Orlando Sequera: compared to agile. Yes.

1181
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.670
Orlando Sequera: and how the Pm. Different from I to it, is not cover in the scope of the Pmp. Exam. It's a.

1182
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:39.929
Orlando Sequera: So that's out of scope.

1183
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:49.250
Orlando Sequera: Predictive is a better option when you know what the final outcome needs to be. But when the final outcome is maybe not that some definite Well.

1184
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:51.800
Orlando Sequera: if you know

1185
01:58:51.900 --> 01:59:06.039
Orlando Sequera: what the fun like on needs to be, and you have, and you have a lot of knowledge, and you have done it multiple times. You're familiar with that scope. So that's why a construction is a good example. We work in a construction company, and we build

1186
01:59:06.090 --> 01:59:08.569
Orlando Sequera: a one story home. That's

1187
01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:13.389
Orlando Sequera: we only build 2 models, and we have done it multiple times. We know the scope

1188
01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:15.099
Orlando Sequera: Really? Well.

1189
01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:18.150
Orlando Sequera: we have done it multiple times. The team is familiar with the scope.

1190
01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:29.910
Orlando Sequera: We know how to get there. It's not only knowing what needs to be built. It's also knowing how to do it right with for other projects. So in those situations it's better to use a predictive.

1191
01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.599
Orlando Sequera: My styles the

1192
01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:41.720
Orlando Sequera: i'm reviewing the comments in the chat on this point.

1193
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:46.570
Orlando Sequera: Customer feedback impacts the lifecycle on the final outcome in agile Yes.

1194
01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.860
Orlando Sequera: it drives it.

1195
01:59:49.730 --> 01:59:57.769
Orlando Sequera: A. What is the difference between agile and incremental incremental is a characteristic of agile agile, is both incremental and iterative.

1196
01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:59.099
Orlando Sequera: because we build

1197
01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:15.779
Orlando Sequera: in increments. We don't deliver all the functionality at once. In one iteration we build an increments we did we deliver, because remember, in one to 4 weeks you don't have enough time to be depending on what the functionality is. You don't have enough time to build all the

1198
02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:21.839
Orlando Sequera: Oh to deliver all the functionality. So that's why we deliver in increments. Agile is both.

1199
02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.330
Orlando Sequera: and incremental.

1200
02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:38.999
Orlando Sequera: Another question would you say that agile helps prevent a bunch of detailed rabbit hole work before thrown thrown out? It seems so

1201
02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:50.790
Orlando Sequera: in a way. Yes, it seems like predictive output can be of base. Yes, because we do a lot of planning in predictive. We have to do a lot of planning. We can go through the wrong ribbon hole to your question. Yes.

1202
02:00:51.610 --> 02:00:53.800
Orlando Sequera: the

1203
02:00:55.660 --> 02:01:02.860
Orlando Sequera: Where's the traditional product manager? It's closer to this from master, but it's not a recognized role, but we work with them.

1204
02:01:04.530 --> 02:01:08.419
Orlando Sequera: And I kind of plan base

1205
02:01:09.670 --> 02:01:15.199
Orlando Sequera: kind of a plan based approach. We change based on project to a change. Base? Yes, and that is

1206
02:01:15.230 --> 02:01:17.100
Orlando Sequera: what we call hybrid.

1207
02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:20.150
Orlando Sequera: You can make some match this approach

1208
02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:24.280
Orlando Sequera: if you starting to it, because for some areas of your

1209
02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:35.609
Orlando Sequera: the scope of the project. That is the key aspect. By the way, you might be wondering how do I know which i'm surprised if this question Hasn't come up. How do I know which is which approach? Should I follow

1210
02:01:35.630 --> 02:01:49.069
Orlando Sequera: that the scope, the the type of scope that we're working with is going to be your best bit. Look at the scope. Do! Are we familiar with the scope really familiar? We have done it multiple times. Hmm. That might be a hint for

1211
02:01:49.080 --> 02:02:02.300
Orlando Sequera: predictive. Oh, this is something that we have never done before, and it's very complex, and we know, going in that it's gonna have multiple changes that is, code for adaptive or agile. So pay attention to the scope.

1212
02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:03.469
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1213
02:02:04.090 --> 02:02:09.259
Orlando Sequera: Reviewing the questions in the Q. And a.

1214
02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.830
Orlando Sequera: A. Please remember to use the voting feature.

1215
02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.039
I see

1216
02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:25.109
Orlando Sequera: a few questions.

1217
02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:31.030
Orlando Sequera: Most of the questions that I see are

1218
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:34.050
Orlando Sequera: about technicals

1219
02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:41.050
Orlando Sequera: and change approach. We applied any time. Yes, you can change it, you can change your approach.

1220
02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:52.229
Orlando Sequera: What is the product seems to be extending more than the schedule plan. It depends on the approach and the depend. The depends on the approach you are following for that. There are ways to address it.

1221
02:02:54.370 --> 02:02:55.300
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1222
02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.240
and

1223
02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.279
Orlando Sequera: for a manager and scratch it can work together. Yes.

1224
02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:10.150
Orlando Sequera: and before we go and break we're gonna have

1225
02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.740
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna take?

1226
02:03:13.530 --> 02:03:15.000
Orlando Sequera: We're going to go over

1227
02:03:15.130 --> 02:03:18.419
Orlando Sequera: the different types of Project mansion offices that we have

1228
02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:22.200
Orlando Sequera: to help organizations to be smarter

1229
02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:30.720
Orlando Sequera: may in many cases they have what we call a project management office organizations that are mature enough.

1230
02:03:30.730 --> 02:03:44.019
Orlando Sequera: A startup. Usually it's not gonna have a Pmo. But to help them to to with those discussions that are coming up in the chat. And they're also coming up in the Q. A oh, but when do I use how? Why.

1231
02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:52.300
Orlando Sequera: Why should I use predictive? Why should I use a a adaptive or agile? How do we do that? How do we implement that? So organizations

1232
02:03:52.480 --> 02:04:05.659
Orlando Sequera: experience that as well? So for that to address the beauty of project management is to be able to have a systematic approach. And what do I mean by that is to be able to repeat these processes?

1233
02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:15.889
Orlando Sequera: For that reason, in many cases, usually larger organization have them. They create. They created what what is called a project management office. Okay.

1234
02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:19.390
Orlando Sequera: A pretty much from office. It's gonna drive it's a group of

1235
02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:28.410
Orlando Sequera: project managers with a hierarchy that is well established, and they're going to be able to provide support to the organization

1236
02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:39.820
Orlando Sequera: so they can conduct their projects. They are multiple flavors of product management offices. We have what is called supportive, and I'm going to say that most organizations follow this approach

1237
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:47.110
Orlando Sequera: it's about best practices for project management. It's about methodologies that we should follow. Remember that these

1238
02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:50.090
Orlando Sequera: covers every single industry, some industries.

1239
02:04:50.180 --> 02:05:19.350
Orlando Sequera: a construction marketing research on development manufacturing so multiple industries. So they're going to be supporting best project management practices for that industry, and they're going to provide that coaching, that mentoring that guidance to project managers. And they're also gonna be a source of those templates. We're gonna go over plans and different templates and documents that we have to create. Where do we get those Usually from the Pmo. If it's in place

1240
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:26.790
Orlando Sequera: in some other cases they can be controlling, because, depending on the industry. Again, we have to make sure we might be.

1241
02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:45.530
Orlando Sequera: there might be a mandate. There might be a hard, a legal requirement in some cases, for you to follow a specific standard, a specific policy in the government. Different levels of government happens all the time you are required to have a project management plan, You are required to create a average register, for example. So

1242
02:05:45.870 --> 02:06:03.360
Orlando Sequera: this in this case, or in in those situations, pmos can be what we call a controlling. Make sure that we are compliant with those requirements, or they can be directive, meaning that they have a higher level of authority. They in when it comes to managing shared resources, and

1243
02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:05.250
Orlando Sequera: before a

1244
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:10.299
Orlando Sequera: is resources you get a look at it from 2 perspective. The people doing the work.

1245
02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:25.639
Orlando Sequera: Remember that they usually support operations and project work, but also physical resources, not just the people. It's also a conference rooms, a or printers that you need to have access or 3D printers Anything that you need.

1246
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:26.500
Orlando Sequera: 2

1247
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.830
Orlando Sequera: complete the project work. Those are resources as well.

1248
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:35.469
Orlando Sequera: and a coordination between multiple projects

1249
02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:39.440
Orlando Sequera: that is also done by a directive organ, a Pmo.

1250
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:43.920
Orlando Sequera: And in some cases for agile organizations.

1251
02:06:43.980 --> 02:07:01.639
Orlando Sequera: They have what they call centers of excellence. They can help in coaching, building that agile mindset for the organization to help them to transition to a more of an agile mindset if that's their journey, and they also help the different roles that we have in those agile teams to

1252
02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:09.430
Orlando Sequera: follow best practices through mentoring and coaching, so they can do so they can get better at what they do

1253
02:07:10.150 --> 02:07:13.660
Orlando Sequera: right. So we are getting awfully ready for

1254
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:18.740
Orlando Sequera: our next break. I would like to address some some of the questions.

1255
02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.500
Orlando Sequera: and

1256
02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:29.289
Orlando Sequera: who offices or provides a private work?

1257
02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:35.540
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna be specific to the organization. But yes, do you mind? Do you have a project sponsor and you have

1258
02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:42.729
Orlando Sequera: a your product Owner is going to be that liaison that is going to be in charge of the scope. So it's. Your

1259
02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:43.980
Orlando Sequera: Your

1260
02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:48.969
Orlando Sequera: product Owner is in charge of that, and you can have a sponsor working on that as well.

1261
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:53.369
That's this.

1262
02:07:53.640 --> 02:08:01.660
Orlando Sequera: Does this to can cover both pinbooks 6 and 7. Yes, yes, we that's what I mentioned like an hour ago. Yes.

1263
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:04.640
Orlando Sequera: we are this stealing all the different references.

1264
02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:18.519
Orlando Sequera: and remember, that is not based on just the pinbook exam is the the exam is not just based on the pinbook. So please throw that away. You have all the content that you need to know here in this

1265
02:08:19.110 --> 02:08:20.870
Orlando Sequera: these lessons. Okay.

1266
02:08:22.570 --> 02:08:30.810
Orlando Sequera: One thing that I want to point out I see great. Input but if somebody has specific questions about the exam, please give us a chance to

1267
02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:32.899
Orlando Sequera: answer those questions.

1268
02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:36.970
Orlando Sequera: This might be different from your organizations. Okay.

1269
02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.290
Orlando Sequera: A:

1270
02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:44.919
Orlando Sequera: Our Pmo. Covering detail for this course. No, this is as as detail as we're going to be going

1271
02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:47.249
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to pmos

1272
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:49.090
Orlando Sequera: it.

1273
02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:52.470
Orlando Sequera: And before we go and break. We have

1274
02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:55.140
Orlando Sequera: what we call organization project management.

1275
02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:07.960
Orlando Sequera: We have to take into account the external environment of the organization. And this is where those factors we're gonna talk about enterprise, environmental factors like marketplace conditions, how they have an impact on the projects.

1276
02:09:07.970 --> 02:09:17.549
Orlando Sequera: We have internal environment, like organizational culture. Those factors also have an impact on your on the projects that we're covering. And then

1277
02:09:18.170 --> 02:09:21.739
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna start getting into something that I see in the chat

1278
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:39.850
Orlando Sequera: a about portfolios, programs and projects and the difference between them. That's this is the actual roadmap of how how organizations break down their individual initiatives, and they also group them so they can make a little bit more sense.

1279
02:09:40.290 --> 02:09:41.170
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1280
02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:49.220
Orlando Sequera: Alright. So let's take our next break. We are going to take a break and we're going to be back in 10 min.

1281
02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:49.929
Okay.

1282
02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:20.530
you

1283
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:41.069
Orlando Sequera: and some of you were having these questions about the portfolio programs and project management.

1284
02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:42.820
Orlando Sequera: And

1285
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:45.280
Orlando Sequera: basically

1286
02:10:45.650 --> 02:10:53.749
Orlando Sequera: I want you to think of the organization of the highest level when they set their goals. For example, we're trying to

1287
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:57.929
Orlando Sequera: grow in the

1288
02:10:59.590 --> 02:11:04.050
Orlando Sequera: European market by 20% in the next 3 years.

1289
02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:21.140
Orlando Sequera: That's a business. That's a strategic goal that the organization has what we, as the supporting organization, have to do. And this is what, by the way it's done by the sea Level Executive, that the see you start with the CEO, the organization and the different sea level executives.

1290
02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:25.709
Orlando Sequera: This is what they're going to be a setting for

1291
02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:27.070
Orlando Sequera: the organization.

1292
02:11:27.330 --> 02:11:32.429
Orlando Sequera: So as the supporting organization, we have to provide a way

1293
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:33.840
Orlando Sequera: for those

1294
02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:37.320
Orlando Sequera: strategic goals

1295
02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:44.469
Orlando Sequera: to come to fruition. And that's where project management comes into play. So we break it down

1296
02:11:44.490 --> 02:11:45.679
Orlando Sequera: into

1297
02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.099
Orlando Sequera: relabels.

1298
02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.160
Orlando Sequera: We start with a portfolio level.

1299
02:11:50.220 --> 02:12:01.820
Orlando Sequera: and this is where we can compile and and collect and group all the different individual initiatives that we call projects that are related to those strategic goals.

1300
02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.489
Orlando Sequera: Perhaps those projects.

1301
02:12:04.590 --> 02:12:14.839
Orlando Sequera: some projects have come on elements, and they are targeting. They have similarities, and we can group them. It's a collection of individual initiative. That's what we call a program.

1302
02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:28.180
Orlando Sequera: and by grouping those. In some cases we can group similar programs and similar individual initiatives that we call projects into portfolios. And that's how we can provide

1303
02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.510
Orlando Sequera: support

1304
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:39.110
Orlando Sequera: for those strategic goals that the organization has in place. It's a way of grouping individual initiatives, and that's where we have portfolio management.

1305
02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:48.560
Orlando Sequera: A portfolio managers that are managing for different performers in the organization. So basically a collection of programs and projects that are

1306
02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.840
Orlando Sequera: similar that are providing

1307
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:56.400
Orlando Sequera: support for a specific strategic goal. Then we also have another level which is

1308
02:12:56.490 --> 02:12:59.770
Orlando Sequera: in which we have pro program managers.

1309
02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:00.740
Orlando Sequera: They

1310
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:03.769
Orlando Sequera: are managing group groups of projects.

1311
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:04.980
Orlando Sequera: the in my court

1312
02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:06.840
Orlando Sequera: the native way, because they

1313
02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:24.779
Orlando Sequera: same it shared resources amongst themselves and shared dependencies, and it's better to group them for the decision making process. Remember that an important aspect of product management is the decision making process, and then we have the individual initiatives in which we have projects, and for those we have project managers.

1314
02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:31.319
Orlando Sequera: So that is the difference between a portfolio management program management and project management.

1315
02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.050
All right.

1316
02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:41.429
Orlando Sequera: organizational structures. We have multiple types of organizational structures. Okay?

1317
02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:50.820
Orlando Sequera: And this is something that we, as project managers, need to understand, because we have to navigate these these organizational structures really Well.

1318
02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:54.689
Orlando Sequera: they're gonna help us to understand how we can

1319
02:13:55.300 --> 02:14:07.440
Orlando Sequera: how we're gonna manage our projects and most effective way. We need to understand that this is for the intel work that we have to do. As a project manager. We need to understand what type of organizational structure is in place in the organization.

1320
02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:13.169
Orlando Sequera: because this is going to have an impact on how we work with our resources, with our people

1321
02:14:13.210 --> 02:14:31.189
Orlando Sequera: a super important aspect. How much authority do I have as a project manager, and it's also going to help me to understand when the resources are going to be available, and how we can coordinate that. And also, how can we conduct the project in the most successful way it is important. You need to

1322
02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:38.040
Orlando Sequera: understand. Try to learn that as quickly as possible, and the key aspect is with

1323
02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:41.940
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to our 30 in

1324
02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:44.150
Orlando Sequera: here. We have

1325
02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:46.860
Orlando Sequera: functional organization

1326
02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:48.150
Orlando Sequera: in which

1327
02:14:48.410 --> 02:14:51.469
Orlando Sequera: this is the traditional breakdown in 2 departments

1328
02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:53.829
Orlando Sequera: that many organizations have.

1329
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:57.859
Orlando Sequera: and it is really important to understand that

1330
02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:04.400
Orlando Sequera: your level of authority as a project manager. If it's a functional organization, it's going to be very low.

1331
02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.270
Orlando Sequera: The team members are going to be reporting to a

1332
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:08.570
Orlando Sequera: manager.

1333
02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:11.110
Orlando Sequera: a functional department manager.

1334
02:15:11.210 --> 02:15:15.169
Orlando Sequera: They're gonna be reporting to their manager, and you are going to be.

1335
02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:18.380
Orlando Sequera: If your level of authority is going to be really low.

1336
02:15:18.670 --> 02:15:26.600
Orlando Sequera: The members report to the functional managers it in the any, the control that you have, or the over a team members

1337
02:15:26.970 --> 02:15:37.239
Orlando Sequera: basically close to none. So you have. You have to use leadership. You have to, and you have to coordinate with those functional managers

1338
02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:46.230
Orlando Sequera: in order to have those resources available. So You need to understand that in this scenario questions for the Pmp. Exam. Look for hint that.

1339
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:57.250
Orlando Sequera: or for any hint, any clues that they might give you about the type of organization. It's really important that you understand what type of organization working with. If it's a functional organization.

1340
02:15:57.270 --> 02:16:01.960
Orlando Sequera: you know immediately that your level of a 30 is very, very low.

1341
02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:12.159
Orlando Sequera: The opposite side of the spectrum is Project Oriented organizations. There's some organizations that do not have that breakdown by department.

1342
02:16:12.190 --> 02:16:15.610
Orlando Sequera: They were based on projects. So it's basically

1343
02:16:16.610 --> 02:16:18.429
Orlando Sequera: teams multiple things

1344
02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:27.189
Orlando Sequera: with a project manager. That is also the functional manager. And by that I mean the person that signs your yearly review, right? Your yearly evaluation.

1345
02:16:27.230 --> 02:16:41.640
Orlando Sequera: A. And it's also the project manager and teams move from project to project to project. In that case your level of authority is very high. You have. You call the shots, you have all you can make, all the decisions.

1346
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.889
Orlando Sequera: and you have

1347
02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:47.050
Orlando Sequera: you. You make the decision when it comes to to the

1348
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:53.449
Orlando Sequera: to the resources and resource availability that you, during their your direct report. So that's what happened.

1349
02:16:53.809 --> 02:17:00.439
Orlando Sequera: Project oriented projectized organizations. But most organizations are

1350
02:17:01.010 --> 02:17:06.069
Orlando Sequera: in what we see here in the middle. They are part of a matrix organization.

1351
02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:10.040
Orlando Sequera: The Matrix organization, by the way, has

1352
02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:11.500
Orlando Sequera: 3 flavors.

1353
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:18.669
Orlando Sequera: If it's a weak matrix, it's very close to a functional organization with matrix your level of a 30 slow.

1354
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:22.789
Orlando Sequera: a medium

1355
02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:36.369
Orlando Sequera: balance matrix, your level of authority medium. And then, as from matrix is very close to a projectized organization, your level of a 30 is rather high, so it's reading print for you to understand what type of

1356
02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:42.660
Orlando Sequera: organizational structure working with most of them are going to be within the matrix flavors.

1357
02:17:43.379 --> 02:17:46.489
Orlando Sequera: because that's what's going to help it to understand how.

1358
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:57.869
Orlando Sequera: what, how much authority, how much saying you have when it comes to the project, what type of coordination! But usually it's gonna be in the matrix, and you're gonna have. And in most cases you're gonna have to work

1359
02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:14.560
Orlando Sequera: through negotiation through communication with functional managers for resource availability. Your level of authority is gonna be in most cases a medium to low. You're gonna have to work with a functional manager for resource availability. So pay attention to the type of

1360
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:28.859
Orlando Sequera: organizational structure in this scenario question. And even if your own organization, or when you transition to a new organization that's gonna help you, they to understand the landscape on how things are done in your organization.

1361
02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:40.819
Orlando Sequera: All right. I see some questions about technical issues. They go in the Q. A. Okay. They go in the Qa. They don't go in the chat. Let's use a chat for content. Related questions.

1362
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:44.289
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1363
02:18:46.299 --> 02:18:47.160
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1364
02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:53.169
Orlando Sequera: They, this is a recommended activity.

1365
02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:59.019
Orlando Sequera: You can think of a project, and try to put yourself in this scenario. A. How?

1366
02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:17.249
Orlando Sequera: What is the type of interrelationship in your organization? What is your level of authority, I will venture to say that most of you are going to say matrix. I will venture to say in the reason for that it's a statistically. It's 80% or more of organizations fall within the matrix type of organization. How resource

1367
02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:26.980
Orlando Sequera: availability is managed, and how projects are conducted, and that's something that you have to pay attention to. This is something that you learn with experience. The first go to

1368
02:19:27.139 --> 02:19:30.530
Orlando Sequera: a resource will be a Pmo.

1369
02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:33.859
Orlando Sequera: If there's a pmo in place. They're going to help you to navigate

1370
02:19:33.930 --> 02:19:48.770
Orlando Sequera: this landscape. But you need to understand quickly, especially if it's your if it's a new job in a new organization. This is part of your initial. This is part of the beginning. The first initial steps that you have to take in understanding how things are done? What? What are

1371
02:19:48.780 --> 02:20:04.959
Orlando Sequera: the different? What what is the the structure here? I mean? It takes time. Sometimes it's not as clear, depending on the type of industry. Sometimes it's it's clear card. Sometimes it's not. So you have to navigate this part of your job as a project manager. It's gonna help you to be successful. You need to understand what type of

1372
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:09.890
Orlando Sequera: organization you're working with.

1373
02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:12.480
Orlando Sequera: All right. AIM

1374
02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:23.080
Orlando Sequera: a few principles that might help you. And, by the way, you do not need to memorize this for the Pmp. Exam what he helps. These are some principles that might help you

1375
02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:32.420
Orlando Sequera: be. You are as tour. You are, as tour of the resources, your store, the budget of store, and scheduled this tour of your project. Be diligent.

1376
02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:34.799
Orlando Sequera: be proactive, and be respectful.

1377
02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:41.149
Orlando Sequera: understand, recognize, understand, and respond to systems interactions. That's why we need to know the landscape

1378
02:20:41.390 --> 02:20:50.989
Orlando Sequera: and and we have to under. Look at the bigger picture. Okay, we have to be able to navigate complexity. It's going to happen. It's not always going to be

1379
02:20:51.330 --> 02:20:59.810
Orlando Sequera: blue skies and clear skies. We're gonna face some storms. It's gonna happen we're gonna have to navigate complexity. It's about collaboration

1380
02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:01.959
Orlando Sequera: with the team and stakeholders.

1381
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:25.610
Orlando Sequera: It's about leadership. Remember that for the Pmp. Exam it's about leadership not about command and control. I know that for those of you that are coming from the military command and control West, your bar and butter for many, many years. Here is about leadership, of course, leadership what's also part of your bread and butter, but mainly command and control. Right? So here is about leadership. In most cases you're not going to have that level of authority.

1382
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:28.000
Orlando Sequera: But you have to still get

1383
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:30.170
Orlando Sequera: things

1384
02:21:30.670 --> 02:21:41.479
Orlando Sequera: to do the work, even without the authority. That's what we're gonna learn here optimizing the risk responses, addressing risks, engaging with stakeholders. We do that through communication

1385
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:53.320
Orlando Sequera: we have to be able to tailor. That's why there's there's not a prescription on how to do it. We're giving you. You can follow an adaptive approach. You can follow a predictive approach. You can combine the 2.

1386
02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:59.819
Orlando Sequera: The these are the the tools that are available to you, and you can tailor that to your specific context.

1387
02:21:59.830 --> 02:22:16.570
Orlando Sequera: by definition contexts are different. Each organization is facing a different context. So you have the flexibility to make some match. This. Not about it. It's not a recipe that you have to follow. Do you have multiple a approaches available. It's about a being able to be

1388
02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:20.439
Orlando Sequera: to that, and being able to be resilient, focus on value.

1389
02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:21.330
Orlando Sequera: it

1390
02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:26.000
Orlando Sequera: incorporate quality into what is what is being done, and also

1391
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:27.440
Orlando Sequera: a

1392
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:29.690
Orlando Sequera: enable change. For

1393
02:22:29.810 --> 02:22:41.899
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that the envision, future state comes to fruition. So we have the end. Goal is to produce that feature state that we're trying that we're trying to achieve with the project. And we have to

1394
02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.490
email will change for that to happen.

1395
02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:45.670
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1396
02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:48.680
Orlando Sequera: And

1397
02:22:50.690 --> 02:22:51.780
Orlando Sequera: this is

1398
02:22:52.610 --> 02:23:02.539
Orlando Sequera: going to be found on your pinbook. Seventh edition. How we go from the principles that we just cover the philosophical foundation to the performance domain

1399
02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:21.390
Orlando Sequera: domains that you're gonna find in mainly in your pinbook. Seventh edition. These are the different a performance domains that you have to take into account for your project. And remember that these principles and performance domains are the philosophical foundation. That is a that you need to take into account for your projects. Okay, we're

1400
02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:29.850
Orlando Sequera: talking about the stakeholders, the team they approach that we have to follow that we briefly mentioned the 3 that we have

1401
02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:35.289
Orlando Sequera: the planning stages, the project work that we have to complete to produce project outcomes.

1402
02:23:35.390 --> 02:23:38.009
Orlando Sequera: the delivery measurement and uncertain.

1403
02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:41.949
Orlando Sequera: So you have to memorize this for the Pmp. Exam. But

1404
02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:49.869
Orlando Sequera: it will help you to understand a. And if you want to do a deeper dive, that's where the Pinbook Seventh edition is going to help you.

1405
02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:53.360
Orlando Sequera: Remember. I'm looking in the chat.

1406
02:23:53.430 --> 02:24:03.939
Orlando Sequera: Please use the chat for content, related questions as most most of you have been doing. You have technical issues. Use the Q. A. Because the chat keeps scrolling. Okay, the Q. A. Is better for that.

1407
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:09.690
Orlando Sequera: Let's talk a little bit about agile. That approach that might be new for some of you

1408
02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:11.999
Orlando Sequera: imagine we have

1409
02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:14.790
Orlando Sequera: agile is

1410
02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:20.000
Orlando Sequera: comes from a he started in 2,001,

1411
02:24:20.350 --> 02:24:30.660
Orlando Sequera: and it comes from the 4 values that were written in the agile manifesto back in 2,001, and they also have 12 principles

1412
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:51.559
Orlando Sequera: agile. I want to start by saying, that is like ice cream. You're gonna see me. I love food. So you're gonna see me. You're gonna hear me making a multiple nige and that analogies to food. And this is one of them agile. It's like ice cream. Most people tend to think that all agile is from that's only one flavor. It's like chocolate, or whichever flavor you think, is the most popular.

1413
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:52.250
Orlando Sequera: Hey?

1414
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:54.819
Orlando Sequera: The

1415
02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:59.670
Orlando Sequera: The agile manifesto, as I mentioned, was written 2,001,

1416
02:25:00.370 --> 02:25:06.790
Orlando Sequera: and this is probably going to help you to understand a a little bit more. Why, that

1417
02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:17.030
Orlando Sequera: common misconception, that agile is only applied to software development. That's where it started. That's where it started in 2,001. It was a group of software developers

1418
02:25:17.210 --> 02:25:29.640
Orlando Sequera: they got together, and that was here in the Us. And Utah at a ski resort, and they wanted to come up with a different approach, because the predictive approach for their industry was in

1419
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:36.269
Orlando Sequera: was not caught in. It was not producing the results. It was very cumbersome from that plan. Driven approach was not

1420
02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:42.780
Orlando Sequera: efficient for them. So they get together, and they came up with the agile manifesto

1421
02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.640
Orlando Sequera: 4.

1422
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:47.559
Orlando Sequera: Their specific situation for software development.

1423
02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:56.500
Orlando Sequera: We we are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others how to do it. And they came up originally with this 4 values.

1424
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:58.220
Orlando Sequera: The first one is

1425
02:25:58.350 --> 02:26:01.420
Orlando Sequera: individuals and interaction over processes and tools.

1426
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:07.419
Orlando Sequera: People. The people that are doing the work are more important than processes and tools.

1427
02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:13.470
Orlando Sequera: They're not saying that processes and tools are not important. There's they were saying that the people that are doing the work.

1428
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:16.700
Orlando Sequera: and the people that the work is being done for

1429
02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:23.739
Orlando Sequera: are more important than the processes and the tools that are more important than Microsoft Project. They're more important than a

1430
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:42.540
Orlando Sequera: than the different tools, or the jira a dashboard that we have for projects. So there, that's what they were saying. People are more important. We do projects for people pricing Don't buy people for other people, so they're more important than processing tools. The second one producing something that works

1431
02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:50.569
Orlando Sequera: because they were able to. They were software developers versus something that works. It's more important than

1432
02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:57.039
Orlando Sequera: comprehensive documentation. This is another misconception of by no means that we're saying

1433
02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:05.819
Orlando Sequera: documentation is not important or even worse than that, that there's no documentation in Agile. There is documentation in natural. Okay.

1434
02:27:05.930 --> 02:27:13.749
Orlando Sequera: there's documentation in agile, but it's not comprehensive, but producing something that works, and you can replace the word software by

1435
02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:22.730
Orlando Sequera: whatever it is applicable to your industry. And it's still it is still the same, the same value producing something that works. It's more important than

1436
02:27:22.890 --> 02:27:24.729
Orlando Sequera: comprehensive documentation.

1437
02:27:24.810 --> 02:27:29.869
Orlando Sequera: The next one customer collaboration is more important than contract negotiation.

1438
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:33.910
Orlando Sequera: and the last one which I personally consider the the

1439
02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:34.940
Orlando Sequera: pivotal

1440
02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:36.310
Orlando Sequera: A.

1441
02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:48.420
Orlando Sequera: The most important aspect of the manifesto is being able to respond to change, that is, agility at its core. Agility at its core is being able to have that being able to respond to changes so

1442
02:27:48.430 --> 02:27:59.260
Orlando Sequera: being able to respond to changes is more important than following a plan, and this is where they drew a line in the same, compared to predictive in predictive is

1443
02:27:59.310 --> 02:28:03.849
Orlando Sequera: predictive, is all built around, for we build the plans, and we follow the plans.

1444
02:28:04.450 --> 02:28:08.720
Orlando Sequera: and that is what we do in predictive, but in agile, no being able to

1445
02:28:09.250 --> 02:28:17.210
Orlando Sequera: respond to changes. It's more important than following a plan. But there is planning in agile, too. Okay, that's another misconception.

1446
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:18.210
Orlando Sequera: So.

1447
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:19.640
Orlando Sequera: But

1448
02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:23.990
Orlando Sequera: there's no documentation, or there's no planning and agile. There is

1449
02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:28.399
Orlando Sequera: some documentation, and there is some planning in agile, but it's more important

1450
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:34.590
Orlando Sequera: to be able to respond to changes and for important to produce something that works. Okay, this is

1451
02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:39.669
Orlando Sequera: what a agile basically at the score. How it came to be

1452
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:49.469
Orlando Sequera: fast forward 2022 years later. This is applicable to any industry. You can replace the worst. Software. This is using research on the

1453
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:54.649
Orlando Sequera: in construction some areas of construction where they're trying to

1454
02:28:54.740 --> 02:29:07.820
Orlando Sequera: to use new materials. They use an agile approach. Okay, so it's applicably a marketing research on development manufacturing in some cases, even in construction.

1455
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:13.449
Orlando Sequera: Of course, in software. Development they they they apply agile

1456
02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:16.280
Orlando Sequera: to a lot of agile in their in their

1457
02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:17.690
Orlando Sequera: different endeavors.

1458
02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:18.340
Okay.

1459
02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:38.259
Orlando Sequera: And they came up with also as part of the foundation. They came up with a manifesto. Their highest priority was a has prior to the to satisfy the customer through continuous delivery of valuable software. That's why we work in iterations. We do it multiple times.

1460
02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:44.740
Orlando Sequera: The second one super important. We welcome changes even late in development. Imagine if you have to make a

1461
02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:48.450
Orlando Sequera: if you're following a predictive approach, the house is almost built.

1462
02:29:48.600 --> 02:30:00.970
Orlando Sequera: The roof is already in place. But then you get a change. Oh, we don't want to use. We don't want a tile roof. We want to to change that for metal. We want you to install a metal roof once. The roof is already in place.

1463
02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:05.260
Orlando Sequera: That is, that's going to be tough. So, but in agile

1464
02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:08.850
Orlando Sequera: you welcome changes at any time, even late in development.

1465
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:13.259
Orlando Sequera: The goal is to help the customer with it, because competitive advantage

1466
02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:19.839
Orlando Sequera: it's about delivering something that works frequently, and they give you here the guidance for the duration of the iterations

1467
02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:22.190
Orlando Sequera: from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.

1468
02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:26.120
Orlando Sequera: Most organizations follow an iteration of

1469
02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:27.730
Orlando Sequera: the two-week duration.

1470
02:30:28.210 --> 02:30:29.950
Orlando Sequera: It's about collaboration

1471
02:30:30.650 --> 02:30:38.049
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders and the people doing the work should collaborate daily through the project so they're giving you a way of how that direction should happen.

1472
02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:48.710
Orlando Sequera: build projects that are motivated individuals. So it's about leadership, about motivation. Give them the give them the tools that they need, so so they can complete the work. And

1473
02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:58.020
Orlando Sequera: they all they pointed out that conveying from the most effective way of conveying information is face to face interaction. Of course it's not always

1474
02:30:58.050 --> 02:31:05.610
Orlando Sequera: possible, and they didn't have the tools that we have nowadays, but it's still true to this day. That is true true statement to this day.

1475
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:09.800
Orlando Sequera: and that's why you see many in many organizations

1476
02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:15.570
Orlando Sequera: agile teams are co-located in the same physical location within 6 feet of each other. But

1477
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:22.180
Orlando Sequera: you can be agile, even if you work remotely as well. So it's not a it's not a must, so that has evolved a little bit.

1478
02:31:22.930 --> 02:31:24.350
Orlando Sequera: The

1479
02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:26.080
Orlando Sequera: and also

1480
02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:33.570
Orlando Sequera: how do we measure Progress is about results Producing something that works is how we measure results.

1481
02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:37.960
Orlando Sequera: It's the primary measure of products producing something that works.

1482
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:42.979
Orlando Sequera: This is about sustainable development. This is not about making people work 80 h a week.

1483
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:48.989
Orlando Sequera: This has to be sustainable. You gotta keep a constant takes. It's not about making people work more

1484
02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:52.939
Orlando Sequera: a paying attention to details that enhances agility.

1485
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:57.380
Orlando Sequera: continuous potential technical excellence. It's about simplicity

1486
02:31:58.050 --> 02:32:11.250
Orlando Sequera: that is maximizing the amount of work not done. You're not gonna be be able to build all the functionality in 2 weeks, right? So you have to prioritize, build the most important functionality at that time, and that's how you build an increments.

1487
02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:19.870
Orlando Sequera: Teams Agile teams are self organized. They make their own decisions internally. They're not told what to do we lead them? We

1488
02:32:19.890 --> 02:32:22.930
Orlando Sequera: support them. It's about

1489
02:32:23.390 --> 02:32:38.400
Orlando Sequera: being servant leaders is not commanding control. They're not told what to do. We let them. They're the experts doing the work, and that's they're the ones that are going to decide how to do the work. They need to understand they what not the how.

1490
02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:40.269
Orlando Sequera: and we have

1491
02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:44.299
Orlando Sequera: a a at the end of its iteration. We have intervals

1492
02:32:44.330 --> 02:32:45.100
Orlando Sequera: that

1493
02:32:45.660 --> 02:33:03.579
Orlando Sequera: is to make adjustments. Go over lessons, learn and make adjustments as needed. So that's one difference between agile and predictive. In predictive. We usually wait at the end of the project to have that retrospective and go over what? Well, what we're going to go over. Let's start, although we should

1494
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:14.920
Orlando Sequera: compile and gather and collect and document. This will sort of through the entire life cycle if we're following a a predictive approach, but in agile we can apply this. Let's learn in real time

1495
02:33:15.550 --> 02:33:20.020
Orlando Sequera: what we learned in one iteration. We can apply it in the very next iteration.

1496
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:21.640
Okay.

1497
02:33:25.010 --> 02:33:27.690
Orlando Sequera: by the way, these are not silver bullets.

1498
02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:30.539
Orlando Sequera: They these are just tools that you have

1499
02:33:30.610 --> 02:33:34.319
Orlando Sequera: approaches that you have available to you. It's up to you to decide which

1500
02:33:34.390 --> 02:33:41.650
Orlando Sequera: is the best approach for your specific situation. They're not telling you you should use agile every every single time or use predictive. No.

1501
02:33:41.710 --> 02:33:50.890
Orlando Sequera: you have to be able to analyze the situation and decide which one's gonna be the best approach for your context, for your situation.

1502
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.810
Orlando Sequera: agile means the iterations

1503
02:33:53.930 --> 02:34:04.370
Orlando Sequera: are going to be shorter. That's the main recommendation, and what you build. Your products are going to be evolving, based on stakeholder feedback, like your mobile app right.

1504
02:34:04.430 --> 02:34:17.300
Orlando Sequera: Think of one mobile app like Whatsapp for communication, how it has evolved over time. When they started version one was only targeting iphone users. But then they came up with a newer version that

1505
02:34:17.490 --> 02:34:22.550
Orlando Sequera: was also a a covering Android users, and over time it evolves

1506
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:26.139
Orlando Sequera: they built in or in iterations, and

1507
02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:27.880
Orlando Sequera: being agile.

1508
02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:38.959
Orlando Sequera: it's probably more important. It's about being able to respond to changes, and it takes time. It's a it's building that agile mindset in some organizations. Some of them are early

1509
02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:56.889
Orlando Sequera: in that journey. The level of material is low. It's about changing that mindset. It's a constant effort they need to understand that is not just having the ceremonies and following the this from ceremonies, for example, that's gonna make us agile. No, it's a whole mindset that it has to to change.

1510
02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:16.409
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand the practices. It's about the values, the mindset and the behavior. And it takes time. This is not something that is gonna happen overnight. Many agile transformations change because some organizations tend to think that just by following the edge of ceremonies that means that we are agile, and that's not the case. It's a whole mindset

1511
02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:18.359
Orlando Sequera: evolution that has to happen

1512
02:35:19.090 --> 02:35:37.850
Orlando Sequera: tailoring to project a context. That is what I've been mentioning before. Every project is unique. You need to have the flexibility to figure out which one of these approaches is going to be your best PET, to produce your desire, the desire outcome.

1513
02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:43.189
Orlando Sequera: You have the flexibility to do that, and by that I mean tailoring the different

1514
02:35:45.650 --> 02:35:47.190
Orlando Sequera: a approaches

1515
02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:56.819
Orlando Sequera: you have to. It's about applying your your your knowledge. The delivery that is needed and defining the most

1516
02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:05.320
Orlando Sequera: appropriate development approach in some cases is going to be predictive of some cases going to be agile on some cases going to be a combination of the 2 what we call hybrid.

1517
02:36:05.550 --> 02:36:13.599
Orlando Sequera: and you have to tailor. This processes determine which one is going to be your best approach. Pay attention to the scope

1518
02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:30.280
Orlando Sequera: of your project for the Pmp. Exam. The first element that you have to look at is the scope, and they're going to give you some hints. The team is well, they they know really well the scope they have worked in similar projects in the past. Those are hints. Those are clues. They're gonna help you. Oh, this is

1519
02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:49.300
Orlando Sequera: May in this. They're very familiar with the scope. They know they have done it multiple times, then on a a traditional approach or predictive is going to be better. Or this is something that is going to be changing, evolving, or very complex. That's a him fragile. Pay attention to that. But always keep in mind that

1520
02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:52.580
Orlando Sequera: you can tailor those practices and methods.

1521
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:53.449
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1522
02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:56.659
Orlando Sequera: A. I see some comments in the chat.

1523
02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:02.020
Orlando Sequera: Who gives the feedback when

1524
02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:04.610
Orlando Sequera: okay, all right.

1525
02:37:09.690 --> 02:37:11.260
Orlando Sequera: Had your products of racing.

1526
02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:15.510
Orlando Sequera: Okay, it's a well traditional project can be also like like that.

1527
02:37:15.810 --> 02:37:16.560
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1528
02:37:17.730 --> 02:37:18.580
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1529
02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:28.320
Orlando Sequera: Just a quick overview of what we cover foundation project management concepts. We went over that. We know the definitions of Project

1530
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:30.420
Orlando Sequera: Portfolio program

1531
02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:36.240
Orlando Sequera: project management. We went over project management principles. Remember, you want to do a deeper dive.

1532
02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:38.129
Orlando Sequera: Check your printbook. Seventh.

1533
02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:51.279
Orlando Sequera: The agile mindset. We went over Agile where it started. And we also more importantly understand now that we can mix a match, we can tailor based on what we are facing. Okay.

1534
02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:58.160
Orlando Sequera: so it's important to keep in mind. Then the next topic is about strategic alignment we have

1535
02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:02.820
Orlando Sequera: for strategic alignment.

1536
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:05.579
Orlando Sequera: This is something that

1537
02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:09.639
Orlando Sequera: the the breakdown the Pmi has

1538
02:38:09.730 --> 02:38:11.120
Orlando Sequera: for the skills.

1539
02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:23.380
Orlando Sequera: and once you get your Pmp certification you have to get what is called professional development units. And but this is a tenant triangle that Pmi has, and your professional development units are going to be a

1540
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:29.179
Orlando Sequera: actually align with this 3 areas. It's about the ways of working, learning

1541
02:38:29.470 --> 02:38:33.150
Orlando Sequera: and mastering a diverse and creative ways

1542
02:38:33.610 --> 02:38:35.810
Orlando Sequera: to get the job done. That is

1543
02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:37.140
Orlando Sequera: the

1544
02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:56.189
Orlando Sequera: core aspect of being a project manager. It's also learning how to a influence others and building relationships. That's what we call power skills. And then business acumen, defective decision making, and how products are like with a big picture. So this is the representation of the talent triangle, and

1545
02:38:56.300 --> 02:39:04.280
Orlando Sequera: but the Pmi has in place, and it's gonna be tied up to. When you get your certification you need to collect 60 P. To use

1546
02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:05.289
Orlando Sequera: a

1547
02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:09.820
Orlando Sequera: in a 3 year cycle. That is the renewing cycle for the Pmp.

1548
02:39:09.850 --> 02:39:10.869
Orlando Sequera: A. Sir.

1549
02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:14.060
Orlando Sequera: So you have to gather 60 P. To use

1550
02:39:14.110 --> 02:39:17.790
Orlando Sequera: that are gonna be tied up to this Pmi tenant triangle.

1551
02:39:20.390 --> 02:39:21.289
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1552
02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:23.530
Orlando Sequera: we also have

1553
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:27.260
Orlando Sequera: strategic alignment and business management skills.

1554
02:39:28.190 --> 02:39:34.009
Orlando Sequera: It's important for us as project managers to understand our organizational strategic plan.

1555
02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:36.109
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand how

1556
02:39:36.970 --> 02:39:42.829
Orlando Sequera: our project goals are aligned with the organizational goals. As I was saying, before, we have the organizational goal of

1557
02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:57.320
Orlando Sequera: growing in the European market. We need to understand how our pretty goals are going to provide the support for that, and we need to have access to that high level overview of the organization. Some of you might be wondering how can we do that?

1558
02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:16.270
Orlando Sequera: We build? We need to build that relationship with our project Sponsor, for example, someone that has that knowledge. We need to work with our key stakeholders to understand the high level overview of the organization, because that's gonna help us to be successful. Our team members are not going to have that. We are the link between that

1559
02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:19.629
Orlando Sequera: high level overview of the organization and the project team.

1560
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:26.539
Orlando Sequera: A. So that is, this bullet points that you see here. That's part of your job as a project manager.

1561
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:30.349
Orlando Sequera: So you can understand essential business aspects of your project.

1562
02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:42.409
Orlando Sequera: You're able to work with the experts that are doing the work, so you can come up with a with the right project delivery strategy. And then, more importantly, to be able to implement this strategy, to

1563
02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:47.820
Orlando Sequera: maximize the business value of your project. That is crucial.

1564
02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:48.770
Okay.

1565
02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:52.190
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1566
02:40:54.900 --> 02:41:05.269
Orlando Sequera: then. This is what I was mentioned, probably the the graphic representation of that. We have a vision and a mission of the organization, and then the organization is going to have strategic

1567
02:41:05.930 --> 02:41:20.290
Orlando Sequera: a and strategy and objectives, and as this support an organization, we have to provide a way for those organizational strategies, goals and objectives to come to fruition. And we do that through

1568
02:41:20.310 --> 02:41:26.280
Orlando Sequera: project management with the different levels. We have portfolio management program, management and

1569
02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:28.139
Orlando Sequera: project management.

1570
02:41:28.290 --> 02:41:37.599
Orlando Sequera: That's how we can provide the support for those individual E. A strategy and objectives that the organization has in place to come to fruition.

1571
02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:48.019
Orlando Sequera: That's why organizations love to use project mansion, because it provides the foundation for that. So in at the bottom of the pyramid we have worth the resources.

1572
02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:50.220
Orlando Sequera: So that's how we're.

1573
02:41:50.470 --> 02:41:53.939
Orlando Sequera: That's why organizations love using project management.

1574
02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:57.610
Orlando Sequera: And now

1575
02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:00.319
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be talking about the influences

1576
02:42:00.370 --> 02:42:05.660
Orlando Sequera: organization inferences. And here we're going to see some topics that some of you were mentioning before

1577
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.060
Orlando Sequera: we have

1578
02:42:08.330 --> 02:42:11.180
Orlando Sequera: what we call enterprise, environmental factors.

1579
02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:15.370
Orlando Sequera: anything that is outside of the control of the project team

1580
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:24.380
Orlando Sequera: that is going to have an impact on the project. That's what we call a an enterprise programming section factor. They can be internal or they can be external

1581
02:42:26.810 --> 02:42:39.410
Orlando Sequera: e when it comes to external. Think about marketplace conditions, or think about economic situation, of think about a global supply chain. It challenges. Those are external enterprise and rural

1582
02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:45.960
Orlando Sequera: and factors, external enterprise, environmental factors. But they could also be internal.

1583
02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:54.050
Orlando Sequera: like the organizational culture. For example, anything internally that is also gonna have an impact on your project.

1584
02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:54.750
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1585
02:42:54.970 --> 02:42:55.560
Yeah.

1586
02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:01.519
Orlando Sequera: Organization or process assets. And these 2 are going to be your new, your 2 new best friends.

1587
02:43:01.630 --> 02:43:04.100
Orlando Sequera: Eef and Opa.

1588
02:43:04.330 --> 02:43:06.110
Orlando Sequera: The key word so

1589
02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:18.720
Orlando Sequera: is is documentation. Is any policy, any template, any communication, any procedure, any historical information about other projects? That's what we call

1590
02:43:18.810 --> 02:43:19.680
Orlando Sequera: and

1591
02:43:19.710 --> 02:43:23.330
Orlando Sequera: in organizational process assets, okay.

1592
02:43:23.370 --> 02:43:38.180
Orlando Sequera: policies, documentations, guidelines, templates, historical information. Those are opa keyword documentation, any price, environmental factors, any factor outside of the control the for the team that is going to have an impact.

1593
02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:39.839
Orlando Sequera: Your project.

1594
02:43:43.170 --> 02:43:46.400
Orlando Sequera: It is important for us to understand the business environment.

1595
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:54.060
Orlando Sequera: Then this is where those enterprise, environmental factors, the external ones, come into play. We do not have any control over them.

1596
02:43:54.100 --> 02:44:01.280
Orlando Sequera: but they're gonna have an impact on your project, and we can use multiple ways to classify them. Pester is one of them.

1597
02:44:01.350 --> 02:44:03.000
Orlando Sequera: and it's basically

1598
02:44:03.090 --> 02:44:04.160
Orlando Sequera: categories.

1599
02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:05.010
Orlando Sequera: The

1600
02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:15.510
Orlando Sequera: classified them by political economics, social, the legal, environmental, or take up. It's another way to classify this external enterprise.

1601
02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:17.380
Orlando Sequera: environmental factors.

1602
02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:31.510
Orlando Sequera: or vuka volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. By the way, there are many offers that are saying right now that we live in a vuka world which is about volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. And

1603
02:44:31.530 --> 02:44:35.430
Orlando Sequera: if you want an example for that, go look at the global pandemic.

1604
02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:39.140
Orlando Sequera: But we also got to look at

1605
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:53.660
Orlando Sequera: a comparative advantage. Analysis, some feasibility studies that are done prior to projects. Organizations look at, they perform multiple sort analysis. We'll go over over this in a little bit more detail when we talk about risk.

1606
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:55.920
Orlando Sequera: So analysis a

1607
02:44:56.180 --> 02:45:08.939
Orlando Sequera: analyzing assumptions they have, and we're going to go over that as well historical information, and then again risk alignment with the organization strategy. So we'll do a deeper dive about using this classification

1608
02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:14.680
Orlando Sequera: prompts or frameworks that can help us to classify this enterprise environmental factors.

1609
02:45:17.470 --> 02:45:25.090
Orlando Sequera: I see a question of the chat. Did anyone capture a definition of an Opier? Any policy, any template keyword is documentation.

1610
02:45:25.390 --> 02:45:33.250
Orlando Sequera: based documentation, any policy, any template, any procedure, any historical information about a project that is an opa

1611
02:45:33.430 --> 02:45:35.229
Orlando Sequera: organization process asset.

1612
02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:37.750
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1613
02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:45.069
Orlando Sequera: Another question to chat like an isop. Yes.

1614
02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:47.910
Orlando Sequera: internal environmental factors

1615
02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:53.509
Orlando Sequera: a factors are going to. They are internal to the organization that have an impact

1616
02:45:54.310 --> 02:45:57.509
Orlando Sequera: in. They're gonna have an impact on the project.

1617
02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:03.199
Orlando Sequera: Big example is going to be organizational culture

1618
02:46:03.220 --> 02:46:05.259
Orlando Sequera: or what we know as

1619
02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:07.830
Orlando Sequera: politics, right? That is.

1620
02:46:08.330 --> 02:46:10.389
Orlando Sequera: we need to know that we need the organization

1621
02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:16.110
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna have an impact on a project that's gonna help us to understand how decisions are being made.

1622
02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:19.460
Orlando Sequera: That is crucial for us to be successful.

1623
02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:26.070
Orlando Sequera: And again.

1624
02:46:26.490 --> 02:46:28.590
Orlando Sequera: this is probably going to be helpful

1625
02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:41.359
Orlando Sequera: any when it comes to opa's, organization process assets and enterprise environmental factors. We have processes, policies, and procedures, templates that those are opa like, or charts.

1626
02:46:41.470 --> 02:46:45.449
Orlando Sequera: rules for for for procurement, higher and onboarding processes

1627
02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:52.360
Orlando Sequera: a or knowledge. Faces like libraries, less repositories. Those are also examples of opa.

1628
02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:55.789
Orlando Sequera: Yes, some examples. As I mentioned before.

1629
02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:58.750
Orlando Sequera: Internal organizational culture.

1630
02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:04.649
Orlando Sequera: distribution of facilities, resource, capabilities, external marketplace conditions.

1631
02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:09.339
Orlando Sequera: a lost regulations and standards applicable to your industry

1632
02:47:09.460 --> 02:47:18.499
Orlando Sequera: operation operating conditions, and then the social cultural influences can take that into account, especially if you're working at a global scale.

1633
02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:20.720
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1634
02:47:22.530 --> 02:47:24.160
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1635
02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:31.719
Orlando Sequera: So, for example, for the shop lifestyle center. What

1636
02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:33.279
Orlando Sequera: the first one

1637
02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:37.939
Orlando Sequera: economic demand for a new shopping area is that? An Ef or an opa?

1638
02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:39.969
Orlando Sequera: What do you think

1639
02:47:43.970 --> 02:47:46.150
Orlando Sequera: that's an a year, right? What about the second one?

1640
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:50.970
Orlando Sequera: Be Historical society building regulations?

1641
02:47:53.270 --> 02:48:00.820
Orlando Sequera: That is an opa, and we're gonna do the next One local neighborhood demand for a better town center. Is that an eef, or is that an opa?

1642
02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:12.319
Orlando Sequera: That's an opa? Right? All right. So feel free to we're gonna do it for the sake of time, just 3. But you can a follow and and basically

1643
02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:15.740
Orlando Sequera: practice that alone. But that's so. You can see an example.

1644
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:29.690
Orlando Sequera: No see local neighborhood. They map for a bed in town center. Do you have any influence over that? That's the question that you have to ask? Do you have an influence on the the local neighborhood demand for where it town center. No.

1645
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:31.699
Orlando Sequera: so that makes it. An ef

1646
02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:38.530
Orlando Sequera: local neighborhood demand is not a policy.

1647
02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:43.890
Orlando Sequera: all right. So we covered

1648
02:48:43.930 --> 02:49:02.280
Orlando Sequera: strategic alignment and business document, and we also went over some of the guidance for effective business decision making process. We explore some organizational influences, some projects. And we went over how projects aligned with broader organizations, strategy and global trends.

1649
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.869
Orlando Sequera: Now

1650
02:49:03.970 --> 02:49:06.959
Orlando Sequera: I would like to go over. Actually.

1651
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:10.909
Orlando Sequera: we have time to go over the other 3. What about

1652
02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:12.330
Orlando Sequera: letter D

1653
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:15.320
Orlando Sequera: we have? Is that

1654
02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:20.960
is that an opa? Or is that an ef

1655
02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:28.059
Orlando Sequera: archive of past large infrastructure projects. That is an opa.

1656
02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:29.960
Orlando Sequera: That's something

1657
02:49:30.310 --> 02:49:32.759
Orlando Sequera: that we documented from previous projects.

1658
02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:38.470
Orlando Sequera: What about the approved vendor and contractors list? Is that an opa, or an ef

1659
02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:42.929
Orlando Sequera: that's an opa.

1660
02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:45.609
Orlando Sequera: what about the tenant selection process?

1661
02:49:46.380 --> 02:49:48.430
Orlando Sequera: Is that an opa or an Ef

1662
02:49:51.970 --> 02:49:53.939
Orlando Sequera: payment selection process.

1663
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:58.360
Orlando Sequera: it's an opa

1664
02:49:59.670 --> 02:50:12.110
Orlando Sequera: to an opa right we have that guidel. That's the process that we have to follow. I'm gonna add another letter. What about of? Thank you. Yes, we we pass the chat to avoid conflict. So it

1665
02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:14.069
Orlando Sequera: if we had

1666
02:50:14.310 --> 02:50:19.990
Orlando Sequera: another global supply chain challenges. Is that an opa, or an if

1667
02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:23.679
Orlando Sequera: that will be an Eef, the key aspect is.

1668
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:25.380
Orlando Sequera: if

1669
02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:29.119
Orlando Sequera: it's about control, Can the team

1670
02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:31.030
Orlando Sequera: can the team

1671
02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:32.690
Orlando Sequera: a

1672
02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:41.649
Orlando Sequera: control? That factor? The answer is, no chances are that it's going to be an actual, a.

1673
02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:50.939
Orlando Sequera: An Ef: okay, so pay attention to that, do. These are factors that we can, that that we have to to control. But, as we said before, any

1674
02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:05.169
Orlando Sequera: any regulation. We we don't have any control over that. So if it's something that we

1675
02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:07.860
Orlando Sequera: that we have internal for the organization

1676
02:51:07.930 --> 02:51:08.810
Orlando Sequera: a

1677
02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:13.599
Orlando Sequera: that we have for human rules that we have to follow higher than on boarding

1678
02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:28.169
Orlando Sequera: templates, documentation, keyword being documentation. That is what we have to follow. A. For an opa. If it's a factor in the project, whether it is internal or external. That's an Eef: okay. So

1679
02:51:30.330 --> 02:51:31.039
Orlando Sequera: please

1680
02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:36.710
Orlando Sequera: follow the chat for the questions that i'm asking not the Q. And a. And

1681
02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:48.779
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Going to go over some questions in the Q. A. The main there's a question in the Q. A. Main difference between OP and ef. In one word, is documentation.

1682
02:51:49.370 --> 02:51:58.910
Orlando Sequera: opas, or documentation. A Eefs are factors that affect your project, whether they're internal or external. That is the difference between the 2.

1683
02:51:59.790 --> 02:52:02.680
Orlando Sequera: Can we get a summary?

1684
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.800
You

1685
02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:08.199
Orlando Sequera: The answers to slide 65.

1686
02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:12.710
Okay.

1687
02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:17.160
Orlando Sequera: What is an example of an opa They not organization knowledge. Face

1688
02:52:17.930 --> 02:52:24.270
Orlando Sequera: an example of an opa, the quality quality policy of your organization. That is an example of an opa.

1689
02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:33.679
Orlando Sequera: From what seat?

1690
02:52:35.850 --> 02:52:36.680
Orlando Sequera: A. Nope.

1691
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:38.690
Orlando Sequera: I no PA

1692
02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:42.830
Umhm.

1693
02:52:43.340 --> 02:52:44.180
Okay.

1694
02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:48.920
Orlando Sequera: you see, an opa or an ef

1695
02:52:52.260 --> 02:52:56.299
Orlando Sequera: right, do we have any control over the local neighborhood? Demand?

1696
02:52:56.580 --> 02:52:58.129
Orlando Sequera: Nope, that's an ef

1697
02:52:59.510 --> 02:53:00.220
Orlando Sequera: put up.

1698
02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:03.399
Orlando Sequera: So if it's documented

1699
02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:05.170
Orlando Sequera: key word documentation.

1700
02:53:06.890 --> 02:53:12.189
Orlando Sequera: Yeah. Historical Society Building Regulations. Do you have any control over

1701
02:53:12.250 --> 02:53:13.760
Orlando Sequera: building regulations

1702
02:53:22.750 --> 02:53:24.789
Orlando Sequera: and let's go back to the definition

1703
02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:26.430
Orlando Sequera: building regulations

1704
02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:30.250
Orlando Sequera: That's an external ef lost regulations and standards

1705
02:53:31.490 --> 02:53:33.410
Orlando Sequera: sunny if it is an if

1706
02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:36.199
Orlando Sequera: correct

1707
02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:51.220
Orlando Sequera: Yeah, my apologies, probably I got it. I got it. I got it wrong.

1708
02:53:55.950 --> 02:53:58.279
Orlando Sequera: If let's go over one more time.

1709
02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:05.029
Orlando Sequera: Tenant selection process

1710
02:54:06.820 --> 02:54:09.920
Orlando Sequera: Is that? An i'm gonna ask you, is that an opa or an ef

1711
02:54:13.770 --> 02:54:18.470
Orlando Sequera: any procedures, any policies, any guidelines that we have to follow.

1712
02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:19.950
Orlando Sequera: It's an opa.

1713
02:54:20.890 --> 02:54:22.449
Orlando Sequera: That's an opa correct.

1714
02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:34.569
Orlando Sequera: So make sure that you

1715
02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:38.660
Orlando Sequera: learn that for the exam that is critical.

1716
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:50.369
Orlando Sequera: There's a common in the chat. It can be changed internally. It should be a fluid concept, not really. There are 2 different things. There are 2 different things.

1717
02:54:51.020 --> 02:54:55.669
Orlando Sequera: factors that could impact your project, which you don't have any control over.

1718
02:54:55.840 --> 02:55:01.060
Orlando Sequera: But they still have an impact on their project. Those are Yes, they're totally different from opa's.

1719
02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:04.999
Orlando Sequera: So. No, they should not be. They're 2 different things.

1720
02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:21.219
Orlando Sequera: you say tenant selection. But what if it has nothing to do with our project? But it has to do with your project. Right?

1721
02:55:21.570 --> 02:55:25.250
Orlando Sequera: So that's the first I that's the first validation that you have to do.

1722
02:55:26.690 --> 02:55:31.139
Orlando Sequera: We are building. Remember what we're trying to build a lifestyle center.

1723
02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:33.539
Orlando Sequera: Right? So

1724
02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:36.160
Orlando Sequera: they are going to be

1725
02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:42.860
Orlando Sequera: related to our project. That's what you have to validate. And, by the way, thank you for that question, because that is the first

1726
02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:44.829
Orlando Sequera: validation process he has.

1727
02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:53.240
Orlando Sequera: If it doesn't have anything to do with the project, then we we, we we don't have to review those opa's right. We have to review what's related to our project.

1728
02:55:53.410 --> 02:55:53.960
Okay.

1729
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:09.220
Orlando Sequera: wouldn't guidance be documentation to Yes, in some cases hands. The reason I said. The key word associated with opa is documentation

1730
02:56:13.370 --> 02:56:17.860
Orlando Sequera: trying to simplify absolutely opa. Think about documentation.

1731
02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:19.850
Orlando Sequera: policies, templates.

1732
02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:29.020
Orlando Sequera: guidelines, anything that is applicable to your product. So part of your job as a Pm. Is to. And and, by the way, it's not that you have to do these on

1733
02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:45.259
Orlando Sequera: you work with the team members. They have work, work with your team members, work with your key stakeholders. They can help you. Okay, we're working on a project that has to do with the man we are revamping the or automating the manufacturing shop, for

1734
02:56:46.010 --> 02:57:04.100
Orlando Sequera: they are going to be regulations. They are going to have an impact. So they're going to have. There are going to be procedures that we have to follow. We they're going to help you with that. You don't have to know that on your own. It's not. But do not assume that for the exam, either that you have to have all the answers. That's why we're working with the project team. Okay.

1735
02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:09.899
Orlando Sequera: they're going to help you. Your team members are going to help you.

1736
02:57:17.450 --> 02:57:25.680
Orlando Sequera: We can break down enterprise, environment environmental factors, as we see here into internal and external. So that is, that is also

1737
02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:27.170
Orlando Sequera: important.

1738
02:57:29.730 --> 02:57:34.130
Orlando Sequera: That's a project. Always need to have a Pm. For the Pmp. Exam: Yes.

1739
02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:39.679
Orlando Sequera: and I would say most cases. Yes.

1740
02:57:45.420 --> 02:57:49.789
Orlando Sequera: opa something that we make up and document

1741
02:57:50.940 --> 02:58:09.130
Orlando Sequera: from past experience to get us in future. Not necessarily just that. That would be a part, but it could be a quality policy for the organization. It's not necessarily from previous project. It's applicable those that's the quality policy that the organization has in place, so it's a little bit broader.

1742
02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:21.390
Orlando Sequera: It has a little bit broader application than just that's one part what you mentioned, Jeffrey. That's one part of it, but it can be broader, too. So we have different

1743
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:37.310
Orlando Sequera: types of opa, these processes, policies, and pursuit. That will be one example. But we have policies that are applicable like quality. The quality policy for your organization that's broader than just that. It's not something that we came up with in the previous projects. Necessarily

1744
02:58:52.740 --> 02:59:00.939
Orlando Sequera: there's a coming in the chat. If we're just working on building the on on the building. Selecting the tenants will be an opa. We won't. Have both.

1745
02:59:01.640 --> 02:59:04.139
Orlando Sequera: We don't have power over that.

1746
02:59:04.390 --> 02:59:06.840
Orlando Sequera: But there's going to be a process in place for that.

1747
02:59:06.900 --> 02:59:08.749
Orlando Sequera: That's what makes it a

1748
02:59:10.050 --> 02:59:13.020
Orlando Sequera: that's what makes it an actual opa

1749
02:59:17.850 --> 02:59:19.300
Orlando Sequera: depends on the project.

1750
02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:25.830
Orlando Sequera: Culture is not is not documentation. Hence the reason culture is an Ef

1751
02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:57.650
Orlando Sequera: organizational culture on the F, An organizational charts. Okay, organizational charts. Okay, I see the confusion here. Thank you for that question. Organizational chart is simply that orchard that shows who the CEO. The organization is who the different directors of the different departments are.

1752
02:59:58.230 --> 03:00:06.699
Orlando Sequera: and the different senior managers and the different functional managers. That's what a north chart is. That's it.

1753
03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:09.270
Orlando Sequera: Organizational culture is

1754
03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:14.539
Orlando Sequera: way much more complex. It depends on the industry.

1755
03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:16.410
Orlando Sequera: It depends on the

1756
03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:29.999
Orlando Sequera: in the industry of the organization. For example, I work for a hospital network that was that is owned by the Seventh Day Adventist Church.

1757
03:00:30.330 --> 03:00:33.050
Orlando Sequera: Their organizational culture was very religious.

1758
03:00:33.090 --> 03:00:33.900
Orlando Sequera: Hey?

1759
03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:35.949
Orlando Sequera: I have also worked for

1760
03:00:36.450 --> 03:00:48.369
Orlando Sequera: start up organizations that are more aligned with what you typically see Silicon Valley that are is very relaxed. That's what we mean by organization of culture. They it's a group of

1761
03:00:48.380 --> 03:00:57.619
Orlando Sequera: values and believes. And if that the organization has in place that's totally different from an orchard, that's the difference between the 2

1762
03:01:06.530 --> 03:01:10.090
Orlando Sequera: or opas or processes, policies and procedures correct.

1763
03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:15.079
Orlando Sequera: Eef. Stands for enterprise of my own factor. Correct?

1764
03:01:16.460 --> 03:01:19.529
Orlando Sequera: Oh, i'm sorry i'll. I'll read the question. I

1765
03:01:19.740 --> 03:01:22.799
Orlando Sequera: please make sure that you change. But you gotta help me out

1766
03:01:23.090 --> 03:01:25.649
Orlando Sequera: my apologies. I've been reading the questions in the chat.

1767
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:33.729
Orlando Sequera: I should read the questions out loud, but change the blue box to everyone, so everyone can see your question, so help me out as well.

1768
03:01:37.090 --> 03:01:40.470
Orlando Sequera: Wouldn't the tenant selection access to the it could exist before

1769
03:01:49.240 --> 03:02:00.719
Orlando Sequera: policies like equal opportunity, access and discrimination. External inference to They are externally friends, too, but they are part of your organization to do. Did you have to follow them? So that makes it an opa.

1770
03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:10.000
Orlando Sequera: Are we saying here that opa is an, if need to be identified before it start? Project you should. Yes.

1771
03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:18.480
okay.

1772
03:02:24.590 --> 03:02:31.149
Orlando Sequera: Are we saying here that opa's on the Ef. Will need to be identified for the sorry project. Again the answer is, Yes.

1773
03:02:36.450 --> 03:02:46.730
Orlando Sequera: not lost. Regulations and standards documented they are. But you don't have any control over that. At least it's in. That's an external factor that has an impact

1774
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:49.629
Orlando Sequera: on your project. You have to follow them.

1775
03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:53.109
Orlando Sequera: That that's it. But you have to know which ones are applicable.

1776
03:03:05.790 --> 03:03:06.420
Orlando Sequera: You.

1777
03:03:06.820 --> 03:03:10.389
Orlando Sequera: But there can be a place where they both meet. Yeah, when you document them.

1778
03:03:10.470 --> 03:03:13.320
Orlando Sequera: But they're different different concepts. Okay.

1779
03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:22.969
Orlando Sequera: feather loss. Ef: yes, we're going to set your policies related to the slows or ops. Yes.

1780
03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:34.699
Orlando Sequera: how's resource capability? And ef do you have any control over resource capabilities? No.

1781
03:03:37.330 --> 03:03:40.159
Orlando Sequera: if you have to work with what you have, that's

1782
03:03:40.450 --> 03:03:41.999
Orlando Sequera: basically

1783
03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:44.439
Orlando Sequera: the fact. The resources that you have

1784
03:03:50.530 --> 03:03:53.800
Orlando Sequera: procurement plan management will, for under Opa. Yes.

1785
03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:03.030
Orlando Sequera: how many questions are we gonna have on this? No. The remember is about application. These are key

1786
03:04:03.180 --> 03:04:09.710
Orlando Sequera: we're working on the foundation. The questions are not gonna be. You need. We need to understand them

1787
03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:13.349
Orlando Sequera: before, and we're getting ready to our

1788
03:04:13.530 --> 03:04:30.449
Orlando Sequera: launch break. So I just wanna make sure this is important. This is the foundation. Please don't get a hurt or yourselves. This is the foundational aspect. So when we start covering the different topics. This is gonna help us. We need to have that foundation, so we can then understand

1789
03:04:30.460 --> 03:04:40.139
Orlando Sequera: it the rest of the terminology. But this is gonna be coming up. This is important for you to understand, for the exam. Remember that the questions are scenario based. They are not

1790
03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:41.630
Orlando Sequera: going to be

1791
03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:46.149
Orlando Sequera: about the definition. They're going to be. The Exam. Is

1792
03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:50.570
Orlando Sequera: a built in a way that is going to ask you about

1793
03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:56.789
Orlando Sequera: scenarios, not about definitions. Okay. But you need to know the definition. So you can answer correctly.

1794
03:04:59.940 --> 03:05:06.420
Orlando Sequera: And ef can change an opa in some cases, Yes, yeah, new law can change internal procedures. So yes.

1795
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:29.049
Orlando Sequera: yeah, I think there's a little bit of overthinking on this anything that you can control, that you cannot control, but still has an impact on the project. That's what we call an Ef. It can be internal.

1796
03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:30.130
Orlando Sequera: like

1797
03:05:30.170 --> 03:05:33.600
Orlando Sequera: the culture of your organization. We also know as politics.

1798
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:41.969
Orlando Sequera: or it can be external, like marketplace conditions, so many people. We work in software development and we we are locating an area in which

1799
03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:43.240
Orlando Sequera: they they.

1800
03:05:43.270 --> 03:05:45.270
Orlando Sequera: They mark there not many

1801
03:05:45.450 --> 03:05:52.060
Orlando Sequera: people available that are software developers. For example, we don't have any control over that yet. It's gonna have an impact

1802
03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:53.659
Orlando Sequera: on your project. So

1803
03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:56.100
Orlando Sequera: that's how we have to or any law

1804
03:05:56.200 --> 03:06:01.820
Orlando Sequera: or any regulation that is applicable to what we do. We we don't have any control over that it

1805
03:06:01.880 --> 03:06:07.120
Orlando Sequera: You Lots of regulations are coming coming up all the time, so put they have an impact

1806
03:06:07.220 --> 03:06:08.050
Orlando Sequera: on

1807
03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:17.000
Orlando Sequera: our project. So that's how you you have to look at it. But any policy, any template, any guideline that is applicable to your project.

1808
03:06:17.070 --> 03:06:19.890
Orlando Sequera: That is some keyword documentation

1809
03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:21.620
Orlando Sequera: that is going to be

1810
03:06:22.440 --> 03:06:24.610
Orlando Sequera: an actual.

1811
03:06:25.290 --> 03:06:29.030
Orlando Sequera: the actual opa organization process asset.

1812
03:06:31.850 --> 03:06:39.269
Orlando Sequera: Yes, do not overthink it. We we just, I just want to make sure this foundation is there to overthink it.

1813
03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:48.900
Orlando Sequera: They are. Chances are that this is going to be part of the information on this scenario questions. But I see a question about Can Can you?

1814
03:06:49.370 --> 03:06:57.580
Orlando Sequera: Can you give an example of scenario given in the test? You have it in front of you, already desperate. Go to test prep, and you're going to see how the questions are asked

1815
03:06:57.940 --> 03:07:00.719
Orlando Sequera: in a much more.

1816
03:07:01.420 --> 03:07:03.969
Orlando Sequera: in a much more better way. Okay.

Orlando Sequera: All right. So we are going to

1818

1822
03:07:41.260 --> 03:07:45.459
Orlando Sequera: It's going to get better. Don't be overwhelmed to let it overwhelm you.

1823
03:07:45.690 --> 03:07:49.110
Orlando Sequera: Do you need to digest this 1 Byte at a time?

Orlando Sequera: Or the class. And, by the way.

1855
03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:49.899
Orlando Sequera: Per CPU users, you can also get it from Github right? They say that Percip is giving you trouble. You can also go to Github and download

1856
03:10:50.180 --> 03:10:52.780
Orlando Sequera: the zip file.

1861
03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:33.379
Orlando Sequera: video. The main recommendation will be to John to join in using

1862
03:11:33.850 --> 03:11:40.570
Orlando Sequera: Zoom. If you're having problems with your audio. Maybe you can rejoin the session. That might help.

1863
03:11:40.820 --> 03:11:41.460
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1864
03:11:42.630 --> 03:11:43.800
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1865
03:11:46.710 --> 03:11:50.300
Orlando Sequera: let's go ahead and continue with

1866
03:11:50.670 --> 03:11:51.470
Orlando Sequera: the

1867
03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:53.540
Orlando Sequera: content. So now

1868
03:11:53.950 --> 03:11:55.819
Orlando Sequera: stop it and remember

1869
03:11:56.220 --> 03:11:59.529
Orlando Sequera: that we mentioned. And, by the way, my apologies.

1870
03:11:59.810 --> 03:12:01.550
Orlando Sequera: we are going to.

1871
03:12:02.020 --> 03:12:13.129
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna be agile. We're gonna make sure that we are a following approach. That that seems to work the most, even though we started with some guidelines at the beginning of the class. I see that

1872
03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:29.470
Orlando Sequera: the chat has been working better for content related questions, and most of you have been following that approach. So let's use the chat for content. Related questions while we are covering. Okay, while we are covering the topics.

1873
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:38.619
Orlando Sequera: And remember that if you have any technical issues, use the Q. A. For that. Use the Q. A. For technical issues.

1874
03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:50.530
Orlando Sequera: If you still have questions about resources. Please feel free to use the Q. A. For that, not the chat. Let's keep the chat under control. If you get out of control. We're going to pass it. But let's keep it under control.

1875
03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:53.079
Orlando Sequera: Ask the questions in the right places.

1876
03:12:53.290 --> 03:12:55.839
Orlando Sequera: Technical issues, Use the Q. A.

1877
03:12:56.280 --> 03:13:02.860
Orlando Sequera: A. Resource. Questions use the Q. And a. Even though we have been answering that multiple times. So please

1878
03:13:02.910 --> 03:13:06.409
Orlando Sequera: use the Q. A. For that. Okay. And

1879
03:13:07.020 --> 03:13:11.590
Orlando Sequera: the chat we can follow along the class. But for

1880
03:13:11.730 --> 03:13:14.130
Orlando Sequera: content, related questions mainly.

1881
03:13:14.330 --> 03:13:24.639
Orlando Sequera: Are we going to address every single question? It's impossible, but i'm going to do my best to, and i'm also going to make sure that I read out loud the questions

1882
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:41.220
Orlando Sequera: depending on where, whether, if i'm reading from the chat, or from the Q. A. I'll make sure that I do a better job in breathing the question. But you need to help me to please make sure that in the chat, change your blue box to everyone. So whenever you type a question in the chat.

1883
03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:51.550
Orlando Sequera: come in. Everyone can see it. Okay, and that way i'll make sure i'll do my best to read out loud the questions before answering the questions. All right.

1884
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:53.360
Orlando Sequera: all right. So

1885
03:13:54.060 --> 03:13:59.279
Orlando Sequera: let's continue with it with the content. We are now going to.

1886
03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:13.910
Orlando Sequera: We're now going to talk about project benefits and value. Remember that we mentioned before. This is an important aspect. The project success it's about benefits. It's about value. So. But we had to start by defining

1887
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:16.219
Orlando Sequera: what value is

1888
03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:20.669
Orlando Sequera: value is about benefits

1889
03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:26.489
Orlando Sequera: That's the main reason why organizations are conducting projects.

1890
03:14:27.170 --> 03:14:30.730
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and it's about benefits. They want to

1891
03:14:31.090 --> 03:14:34.710
Orlando Sequera: produce the benefits to the organ, but it

1892
03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:54.259
Orlando Sequera: he's totally to the organization. It could be to the community where the organization is so this benefit can be applied to multiple aspects not necessary, and it's not necessarily monetary benefit. Right? That's one type of tangible benefits. But you could also have some intangible benefits, like

1893
03:14:54.270 --> 03:14:54.970
Orlando Sequera: a

1894
03:14:55.610 --> 03:15:06.870
Orlando Sequera: helping the community. That's more of an intangible benefit. Corporate social responsibility, for example, that the organization can that the community where the organization lives

1895
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:09.710
Orlando Sequera: it can benefit from that particular project.

1896
03:15:10.180 --> 03:15:27.539
Orlando Sequera: market recognition, etc. So all the benefits are not necessarily tangible. Some of them can be in tangible. But but they're still a part. They still add value to the organization. They're still part of those benefits, and this is gonna be identified by

1897
03:15:27.630 --> 03:15:29.399
Orlando Sequera: A by the project

1898
03:15:29.600 --> 03:15:30.670
Orlando Sequera: in

1899
03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:38.129
Orlando Sequera: benefits. Realization is when, though when, though those benefits that we.

1900
03:15:38.210 --> 03:15:49.219
Orlando Sequera: a originally said as a target with our particular project are actually come to fruition. That's when a that's what we mean by benefits of realization.

1901
03:15:49.290 --> 03:15:53.919
Orlando Sequera: So when those benefits come to to fruition when they become.

1902
03:15:54.590 --> 03:15:59.799
Orlando Sequera: when would they become reality? That's when we can say that

1903
03:15:59.950 --> 03:16:04.749
Orlando Sequera: we have been able to achieve our business value. But value is.

1904
03:16:04.810 --> 03:16:22.870
Orlando Sequera: and and we also get a keeping to account. It's going to be defined by the actual a organization by your stakeholders value. They're. They're the ones that define a. V. What is of value to them. So so it's not the team. It's not the Pm.

1905
03:16:22.880 --> 03:16:27.019
Orlando Sequera: It's actually the stakeholders. They we need to keep that into account.

1906
03:16:27.100 --> 03:16:27.780
Okay.

1907
03:16:28.260 --> 03:16:37.789
Orlando Sequera: so. But the ultimate goal of any project is to add value to a business. We gotta remember that, and that is tied up to the actual.

1908
03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:41.839
Orlando Sequera: A definition of success that we're using for projects.

1909
03:16:43.130 --> 03:16:44.060
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1910
03:16:44.390 --> 03:16:45.920
Orlando Sequera: I

1911
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:50.480
Orlando Sequera: We are going to.

1912
03:16:51.200 --> 03:17:02.500
Orlando Sequera: We're going to the to on past the chat. But remember what we said. Please help me with that. We're going to unpause the chat with the chat is for content. Related questions.

1913
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:09.220
Orlando Sequera: technical issues, Qa: research questions, Qa: or if I am not

1914
03:17:09.490 --> 03:17:23.680
Orlando Sequera: being able to. If I' not be able to see your questions in the chat, then feel free to use the Q. A. For Content related questions to make sure that I answer them. Okay. So let's do that With that set we are going to on past

1915
03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:25.510
Orlando Sequera: the chat.

1916
03:17:26.300 --> 03:17:26.990
Orlando Sequera: Alright.

1917
03:17:37.490 --> 03:17:46.730
Orlando Sequera: What is an there's a question in the chat. What is an example of stakeholders in your current role as a Pm. We're gonna talk about stakeholders by definition, anybody that

1918
03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:53.370
Orlando Sequera: can be impacted by the project is a stakeholder, but we're going to talk about that. That's a topic in the class we're going to talk about that

1919
03:17:56.090 --> 03:18:00.290
Orlando Sequera: we are going to continue with the content. So

1920
03:18:00.490 --> 03:18:08.159
Orlando Sequera: if we, if you need to refer to previous topics, I think we cover in detail, there's a question of opa, and ef we went over that

1921
03:18:08.820 --> 03:18:20.039
Orlando Sequera: in detail, so please review the recording if you need to, or read the the content again. But I think we went over that we highlighted multiple definitions.

1922
03:18:20.230 --> 03:18:22.440
Orlando Sequera: continuing with the content

1923
03:18:24.330 --> 03:18:25.890
Orlando Sequera: we are.

1924
03:18:27.560 --> 03:18:29.470
Orlando Sequera: we have to take a look at

1925
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:31.459
Orlando Sequera: business value.

1926
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:32.720
Orlando Sequera: A.

1927
03:18:32.920 --> 03:18:39.100
Orlando Sequera: We need to work with our stakeholders. As I mentioned before, value is defined by our stakeholders.

1928
03:18:39.290 --> 03:18:45.429
Orlando Sequera: We have to work and rely with our experts with the people that are doing the work your subject matter experts

1929
03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:50.740
Orlando Sequera: to to leverage their expert knowledge, and then.

1930
03:18:51.410 --> 03:19:00.179
Orlando Sequera: by doing that, we can then examine, evaluate, and confirm, to be able to determine exactly what is or can be of value.

1931
03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:04.319
Orlando Sequera: There is a question in the chat. Oh, okay.

1932
03:19:05.280 --> 03:19:07.179
Orlando Sequera: there's a question in the chat.

1933
03:19:08.270 --> 03:19:21.459
Orlando Sequera: Value is only one. You have to. It's only quantified. You have to be able to measure it, but some of it is going to be in tangible, but somehow you have to be able to measure it. That's why we say that value is planifiable.

1934
03:19:21.490 --> 03:19:22.210
Okay.

1935
03:19:23.650 --> 03:19:24.940
Orlando Sequera: all right, please.

1936
03:19:26.170 --> 03:19:27.670
Orlando Sequera: A

1937
03:19:29.500 --> 03:19:30.820
Orlando Sequera: would just

1938
03:19:30.850 --> 03:19:50.180
Orlando Sequera: an update. Be consider a creation without new value. You have to define this with your in some cases. Yes, but it comes from your a, your stakeholders right. This, whatever they consider, that is a value. That definition is gonna come from them. So we have to work with our experts.

1939
03:19:50.190 --> 03:20:01.629
Orlando Sequera: W: we are with the people that are doing the work. Our team members to a really understand, to make sure that we're all on the same page. But that definition of value, what is the value comes

1940
03:20:01.650 --> 03:20:03.470
Orlando Sequera: from the stakeholders

1941
03:20:04.060 --> 03:20:08.260
Orlando Sequera: we have, we can to help us with that. With that definition

1942
03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:09.990
Orlando Sequera: a

1943
03:20:10.690 --> 03:20:22.930
Orlando Sequera: we might look at shareholder value business growth if it's a private business, or if it's a a probably trade in in the stock market, a look at the shareholder value we can look at customer value.

1944
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:29.109
Orlando Sequera: It could also be employee, knowledge or channel or business partner value. But this is going to

1945
03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:44.369
Orlando Sequera: come from our stakeholders. Okay, we're not the ones they're the ones that define what is the business value, and we as a team, and by that I mean the product team. We need to be on the same page.

1946
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:45.289
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1947
03:20:46.310 --> 03:20:47.150
all right.

1948
03:20:55.390 --> 03:20:58.380
Review in the chat for any questions.

1949
03:20:59.270 --> 03:21:04.840
Orlando Sequera: If you can quantify valuable, that's why it's tied up. You have to be able to measure it. That's why you need to be able to quantify.

1950
03:21:05.450 --> 03:21:10.910
Orlando Sequera: But one thing that I want to highlight is not all return of investment. That's also that's

1951
03:21:10.980 --> 03:21:13.389
Orlando Sequera: financial.

1952
03:21:13.800 --> 03:21:25.810
Orlando Sequera: That's the financial metric but value is not always as we as we just mentioned, it's not always tangible. Okay, it can be intangible. It can be helping the community. It can be

1953
03:21:25.980 --> 03:21:31.370
Orlando Sequera: a a brand recognition so tangible it can be tangible, or it can be intangible.

1954
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:43.740
Orlando Sequera: It's the business value, part of the scope. Nope. It is. That's another question in the chat.

1955
03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:48.660
Orlando Sequera: and please change your blue blocks to everyone, so everyone can see your question

1956
03:21:48.790 --> 03:22:14.420
Orlando Sequera: If there there's a question in the chat, it's the business value. Part of the scope. Nope. The scope is the work that we have to complete. We're going to talk about that. This is about the genesis of the project that justified, Why are we undertake? Why is the organization willing to invest time and money and resources in a particular project? They're looking for value, and it's way before scope that happens later. So this is at the Genesis stage

1957
03:22:14.430 --> 03:22:15.530
Orlando Sequera: off the project

1958
03:22:22.050 --> 03:22:23.530
Orlando Sequera: a stakeholder.

1959
03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:30.949
Orlando Sequera: Well, okay, please make sure that with the definitions. I know that some of you are trying to help. But please

1960
03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:32.550
Orlando Sequera: A,

1961
03:22:32.910 --> 03:22:40.440
Orlando Sequera: we're going to address the questions. Okay, and we gotta. We gotta be careful with some some definitions.

1962
03:22:40.450 --> 03:22:57.720
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna make sure that we provide the right information. A stakeholder, by definition, is anyone that can be impacted by the project or that could impact the project. That's a very broad definition. We're gonna go over that in detail when we talk about stakeholders. That's an area of project management that we're gonna go over that over over late.

1963
03:22:59.900 --> 03:23:07.909
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat. Can employees need help with understanding who stakeholders are? Yes, you need to define who your stakeholders are. That's one of the first

1964
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:16.220
Orlando Sequera: activities that you have to complete as a project manager. You need to understand who your stakeholders are so in this case wouldn't be. The employees will be you as a project manager.

1965
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:20.510
Orlando Sequera: My apologies let me go back.

1966
03:23:23.710 --> 03:23:25.409
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to

1967
03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:28.550
Orlando Sequera: through some of our questions.

1968
03:23:43.480 --> 03:23:48.620
Orlando Sequera: Would that be the project, Charter? It could be there. Yes, that's in the brochure.

1969
03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:51.170
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the chat. Will that be in? The

1970
03:23:51.810 --> 03:23:52.650
Orlando Sequera: is

1971
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:57.389
Orlando Sequera: one of the aspects that we have to understand to the bell of the project Charter

1972
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:08.870
Orlando Sequera: with a Brian, a reputation kind of some tangible value. That's another question in the chat. Absolutely. Yes.

1973
03:24:12.580 --> 03:24:24.700
Orlando Sequera: all right. So let's try to avoid having separate classes. Let's try to stick to one class and try to follow. We'll address the questions a in a timely manner, I promise you that. Okay.

1974
03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:27.760
Orlando Sequera: So, please, i'm gonna i'm gonna post the chat

1975
03:24:29.500 --> 03:24:30.769
Orlando Sequera: so we can.

1976
03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:32.750
Orlando Sequera: So we can continue

1977
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:35.090
Orlando Sequera: with with the class.

1978
03:24:35.720 --> 03:24:36.600
Orlando Sequera: all right

1979
03:24:36.670 --> 03:24:39.879
Orlando Sequera: examples or types of business values that we have.

1980
03:24:42.330 --> 03:24:48.479
Orlando Sequera: And this is what I was mentioning. It's not always financial gain that return of investment, that profit.

1981
03:24:48.980 --> 03:24:56.199
Orlando Sequera: I'm not gonna say that most organizations are not looking for financial gain absolutely depending on the industry. What they what

1982
03:24:56.360 --> 03:25:04.049
Orlando Sequera: the reasoning for them to be in business. Yes, in many cases that is the case. But it could also be about attracting new customers

1983
03:25:04.730 --> 03:25:11.639
Orlando Sequera: social benefit. What I what I mentioned before. Maybe the project is about improving.

1984
03:25:12.100 --> 03:25:16.609
Orlando Sequera: Your organization is trying to come up with a.

1985
03:25:16.630 --> 03:25:20.559
Orlando Sequera: With a new way to clean

1986
03:25:20.690 --> 03:25:22.520
Orlando Sequera: a to

1987
03:25:22.580 --> 03:25:33.359
Orlando Sequera: system. I'm trying to think about something for a minute. Okay. Imagine plastic recollection in by, in in the nearby beaches or or ocean.

1988
03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:37.630
Orlando Sequera: right? So how we we're coming up with a better way. Our

1989
03:25:37.660 --> 03:25:41.460
Orlando Sequera: Our our organization wants to provide a

1990
03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:50.600
Orlando Sequera: the people that live in this community in Florida with a better way to clean up their beaches and and to collect plastic

1991
03:25:50.610 --> 03:26:06.270
Orlando Sequera: and garbage. Right so that social benefit you can. Are they going to be making a financial gain out of that. Not necessarily. But it is gonna have a positive impact in that community. So that's a social, an example of social benefit. But it could also be being first to market

1992
03:26:06.430 --> 03:26:11.699
Orlando Sequera: when you're trying to come up with with a new service, a new, a type of app

1993
03:26:11.770 --> 03:26:28.179
Orlando Sequera: to the mark. You want to be first to market with that idea before anyone else it comes out to with something similar, so that could be that's also basis value. But again, this is going to be defined by the business. This is going to be defined by the organization, or it could be an improvement

1994
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:34.680
Orlando Sequera: to a technological process that is in place. That's also basis, value, or

1995
03:26:35.010 --> 03:26:39.099
Orlando Sequera: in some cases it will be a way for us

1996
03:26:39.130 --> 03:26:40.000
Orlando Sequera: 2.

1997
03:26:40.100 --> 03:26:44.969
Orlando Sequera: Make sure that we're compliant with changes to existing regulation or loss.

1998
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.890
Orlando Sequera: or

1999
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:53.130
Orlando Sequera: changes to standards that are applicable to our industry. That's compliance. That's what we mean by regularization. So

2000
03:26:53.210 --> 03:27:13.030
Orlando Sequera: the point here being that is not of business value is not always about financial gain. That's the main point that we're trying to make here. Okay. And this is defined by the organization. This is defined by your stakeholders. It's not defined by the team. It's not defined by

2001
03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:15.400
Orlando Sequera: A.

2002
03:27:15.460 --> 03:27:18.850
Orlando Sequera: By new cost, by by by by

2003
03:27:18.930 --> 03:27:24.359
Orlando Sequera: view. The project manager by the team. It's not defined by your.

2004
03:27:24.900 --> 03:27:28.039
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be defined by the stakeholders and by your

2005
03:27:28.900 --> 03:27:30.599
Orlando Sequera: by the business. Okay.

2006
03:27:31.170 --> 03:27:34.350
Orlando Sequera: I see some questions in.

2007
03:27:34.400 --> 03:27:35.230
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2008
03:27:35.380 --> 03:27:53.660
Orlando Sequera: guys. Try to let let let let's. Let's keep a positive added to towards the class. Remember, we have thousands of you. We're trying to do the best. I let's try to keep a positive environment, a positive approach for the class. We're gonna get to your questions when we, when

2009
03:27:53.670 --> 03:28:07.949
Orlando Sequera: whenever possible, remember it's gonna be impossible to answer every single question. I see a question here. What is a channel? Okay, Imagine a a major organization that they live that produces a

2010
03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:27.699
Orlando Sequera: that that makes a phones smartphones, and then they have their distribution a organis they have. They work with other distribution companies to distribute their projects their their products right? That will be an example of a channel. So it's not. If I am not

2011
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:40.900
Orlando Sequera: paying attention to a specific topic is because it's not really that relevant to the content. Okay, but a chat, a distribution channel, the distribution partner. I am sure that you have been able to to see multiple examples of that. Okay.

2012
03:28:41.340 --> 03:28:44.780
Orlando Sequera: All right, Remember the questions I

2013
03:28:45.730 --> 03:28:48.359
Orlando Sequera: and let's try to keep the questions related to

2014
03:28:48.410 --> 03:28:51.280
Orlando Sequera: the actual content that we are covering

2015
03:28:52.090 --> 03:28:52.780
Orlando Sequera: all right

2016
03:28:56.910 --> 03:28:58.810
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2017
03:28:59.020 --> 03:29:02.379
Orlando Sequera: understanding the work that we have to do.

2018
03:29:03.340 --> 03:29:14.320
Orlando Sequera: and then, understanding how do we have to allocate organizational resources for our projects? We we need to understand the type of work that we're going to be doing.

2019
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:15.789
Orlando Sequera: And

2020
03:29:16.100 --> 03:29:17.130
Orlando Sequera: this

2021
03:29:17.330 --> 03:29:34.409
Orlando Sequera: is about understanding those strategic goals of the organization. That's why it is so important that as project managers, we need to have visibility to those organizational goals, to those organizational strategies that the organization has in place.

2022
03:29:35.160 --> 03:29:39.509
Orlando Sequera: so we can then understand the link between our projects

2023
03:29:39.610 --> 03:29:45.089
Orlando Sequera: and those organizational goals. Our team members usually do not have

2024
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:49.310
Orlando Sequera: exposure, do not have access to that. They

2025
03:29:49.430 --> 03:30:03.620
Orlando Sequera: are working in operations they are working on. They're gonna be work. They're the subject matter experts that are going to be working on the project put. They do not have access to that bigger. Usually they do not have access to that bigger picture. Your sponsor, that

2026
03:30:03.630 --> 03:30:17.210
Orlando Sequera: upper management desk. You should have it if you don't have it, you should try to get it you that is pivotal for you to be successful with your project, and this is about the genesis of a project, the justification of a project

2027
03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:24.619
Orlando Sequera: it that business case this is this is before the project actually exists. So it is important to

2028
03:30:24.930 --> 03:30:26.160
Orlando Sequera: understand

2029
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:41.370
Orlando Sequera: and work on that. And and this is even before the business case. Right? We need to understand the goals and objectives of the organization has, so we can then proactively identify some possible opportunities and some possible issues that we might have.

2030
03:30:41.560 --> 03:30:44.430
Orlando Sequera: We work with other professionals.

2031
03:30:44.860 --> 03:30:57.569
Orlando Sequera: In this case you have a business analyst, someone that has expert knowledge about that specific field. It's assumed that our project is to develop a software for the accounting department.

2032
03:30:58.120 --> 03:31:14.800
Orlando Sequera: Then most cases that business analyst is gonna have expert knowledge about accounting, and it's gonna help us to understand what are the business calls of the organization. Perhaps it is increase the efficiency of our

2033
03:31:14.820 --> 03:31:18.429
Orlando Sequera: it. They probably want to co increase

2034
03:31:18.450 --> 03:31:20.559
Orlando Sequera: cost efficiencies by 20%

2035
03:31:20.650 --> 03:31:23.240
Orlando Sequera: The next 3 years. That might be a business call.

2036
03:31:23.310 --> 03:31:25.320
Orlando Sequera: they, and they might help

2037
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:30.029
Orlando Sequera: to understand what are the issues that you're facing. Possibly it is with

2038
03:31:30.040 --> 03:31:46.939
Orlando Sequera: current regulation or regulation that it's been updated, or opportunities that we have maybe more automation by help. Some of the reports are being done rather manually, etc., so they're gonna help you with that. And this is before the business case. And this

2039
03:31:46.950 --> 03:31:58.069
Orlando Sequera: is when you're gonna be able to come up with what should be done that starting to understand this, cope with your project. What should be done? What are the initial limitations or constraints.

2040
03:31:58.110 --> 03:32:03.869
Orlando Sequera: the assumptions something that we take to be true without having any.

2041
03:32:04.690 --> 03:32:20.409
Orlando Sequera: without something that would take to be true, but we don't really have what we don't know for certain. We we we have to make assumptions usually in predictive a project. Management. We make tons of assumptions. We have to try to be as accurate as possible

2042
03:32:21.120 --> 03:32:37.910
Orlando Sequera: risks and dependencies. We're going to elaborate on those later. Then what is the criteria for success. We also need to know that. How do we know that we're what we're doing is actually successful and deciding value? And what is the implementation approach? Are we going?

2043
03:32:38.180 --> 03:32:46.170
Orlando Sequera: We go predictive. Should we go agile, or should we use a combined a approach? Okay.

2044
03:32:46.960 --> 03:32:47.799
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2045
03:32:48.310 --> 03:32:49.130
Orlando Sequera: So

2046
03:32:50.170 --> 03:32:52.340
Orlando Sequera: let's.

2047
03:32:52.540 --> 03:32:57.049
Orlando Sequera: Let's continue. And this is going to produce some documentation.

2048
03:33:02.240 --> 03:33:08.730
Orlando Sequera: This is going to be the outcome of that initial a analysis. So we're going to start to pro, to be able to produce

2049
03:33:08.930 --> 03:33:13.550
Orlando Sequera: this, the documentation that are going to help us throughout the project. A:

2050
03:33:13.680 --> 03:33:14.539
Orlando Sequera: And

2051
03:33:14.610 --> 03:33:16.980
Orlando Sequera: this is this is really important.

2052
03:33:17.010 --> 03:33:20.940
Orlando Sequera: It you gonna have. And some of this basic documentation you're gonna have

2053
03:33:21.410 --> 03:33:30.020
Orlando Sequera: a. The organization is following regular standards and procedures. You're gonna have access to them, right? They can help you to understand

2054
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:34.580
Orlando Sequera: project objectives and contribution to the business goals.

2055
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:41.580
Orlando Sequera: They can help the business. And this is where the project selection, criteria comes into play.

2056
03:33:41.940 --> 03:33:47.290
Orlando Sequera: Organizations are going to determine whether a project is going to be

2057
03:33:47.710 --> 03:33:53.379
Orlando Sequera: proof or not, not because we have a 100 projects. All of them are going to be selected.

2058
03:33:53.700 --> 03:34:03.990
Orlando Sequera: They're going to this business documentation, and it's business, justification, business case facilities, duty. That's what I that's what I mean by business documentation.

2059
03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:12.940
Orlando Sequera: This is going to help documentation organizations to make the best decisions when it comes to selecting their projects. Remember

2060
03:34:13.250 --> 03:34:27.820
Orlando Sequera: every single organization we do not have on limit. No organization in the world has unlimited resources. They have limited resources, and what do I mean by that? They have a limited amount of money and a limited amount of time.

2061
03:34:28.470 --> 03:34:31.290
Orlando Sequera: and also a limited amount of people to

2062
03:34:31.580 --> 03:34:47.560
Orlando Sequera: conduct the projects, and they're gonna have a criteria for selecting those projects. It's usually based on what's gonna give them more bank for their buck. That's one way, usually looking at financial metrics, but it could also be what's gonna add

2063
03:34:47.570 --> 03:35:02.009
Orlando Sequera: more value to the community if they're looking after. If they're chasing that type of business value, it depends on what that's why we talked about business value being defined by the organization. The stakeholders is whatever

2064
03:35:02.060 --> 03:35:07.059
Orlando Sequera: this point to help them in making sure that those strategic goals

2065
03:35:07.930 --> 03:35:19.580
Orlando Sequera: come to fruition. So they're gonna select projects that are aligned with those calls, and that's something that we have to understand. So our project of a

2066
03:35:20.060 --> 03:35:35.099
Orlando Sequera: developing for the account and department, if one of the strategic goals of the organization is to increase efficiency, a associated with a financial efficiency by 20% in the next year. Then

2067
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:43.250
Orlando Sequera: that that's an I Chances are that that project is gonna get selected. So that's gonna help us in justification that's gonna help the organization to

2068
03:35:43.460 --> 03:35:59.159
Orlando Sequera: a make the the best decisions possible. And that's why they like this approach. This is systematic. It it's about decision making some of the decision making process. So usually most cases organizations are going to select projects that are aligned with.

2069
03:35:59.170 --> 03:36:07.380
Orlando Sequera: They strategic goals that as an organization they have in place. Okay, that's how this a process occurs.

2070
03:36:08.730 --> 03:36:09.660
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2071
03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:17.110
Orlando Sequera: but we have to helping. We have to work on creating these documents. So this business document, the business case that's

2072
03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:24.399
Orlando Sequera: that is crucial. When it comes to providing the justification for your project.

2073
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:25.939
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna help

2074
03:36:26.460 --> 03:36:29.800
Orlando Sequera: in present in the case, right? Why should

2075
03:36:29.850 --> 03:36:35.690
Orlando Sequera: I, as an organization, invest money and time in this particular project? Well.

2076
03:36:36.190 --> 03:36:44.749
Orlando Sequera: that's where the business case is going to answer that question. It's going to provide a cost benefit analysis. It's going to provide a business. Need it's going to provide a

2077
03:36:44.940 --> 03:36:48.570
Orlando Sequera: some scheduling cost constraints, answering the questions

2078
03:36:48.810 --> 03:36:52.859
Orlando Sequera: answering those questions. Okay. And usually

2079
03:36:52.970 --> 03:36:58.280
Orlando Sequera: if he gets accepted, this is gonna help in, and this is gonna be one of

2080
03:36:58.370 --> 03:36:59.300
Orlando Sequera: they

2081
03:36:59.380 --> 03:37:05.870
Orlando Sequera: documents that we're going to use in order to develop the project. Charter, we're going to talk about the pro charter a little bit later.

2082
03:37:06.140 --> 03:37:16.919
Orlando Sequera: So we need to have this in place, but it's also ultimately going to help the organizations to make the best decisions in selecting the projects for their next. The fiscal year, for example.

2083
03:37:17.500 --> 03:37:20.030
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to benefits

2084
03:37:20.220 --> 03:37:23.510
Orlando Sequera: we need to have a benefits management plan that

2085
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:28.569
Orlando Sequera: should help us to understand how to create, how to maximize and how to sustain

2086
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:35.460
Orlando Sequera: project benefits. That is important. It's about adding value right providing benefits. That's why we need this benefits management plan.

2087
03:37:35.530 --> 03:37:38.609
Orlando Sequera: What is the timeframe. Are we going to have short

2088
03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:58.320
Orlando Sequera: benefits, realization, short time, benefit realization, or is it long-term benefits realization? It? It changes from project to project. Who's going to be the benefits owner who's going to benefit within the organization a. Or who's the accountable person? Them going back to? Why do we? And that was a question in the chat I think about.

2089
03:37:58.970 --> 03:38:18.270
Orlando Sequera: Why are we talking about a quantifying benefits and quantifying value? Because we have to be able to measure right. So this benefit plan is going to help you with establishing what metrics are you going to be using to to measure those benefits? And then the list of assumptions. Remember what I said. What an assumption is

2090
03:38:18.450 --> 03:38:21.830
Orlando Sequera: something that we take to be through without having evidence.

2091
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:24.630
Orlando Sequera: For example, i'll. I'll give you a quick example.

2092
03:38:24.770 --> 03:38:28.380
Orlando Sequera: In in the past we work with supplier a

2093
03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:31.099
Orlando Sequera: and supplier a always deliver.

2094
03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:33.679
Orlando Sequera: They're deliver on time.

2095
03:38:34.020 --> 03:38:37.179
Orlando Sequera: Therefore we're going to assume that for this new project

2096
03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:42.029
Orlando Sequera: Supplier a is going to deliver again on time. That's an assumption that i'm making.

2097
03:38:42.180 --> 03:38:44.999
Orlando Sequera: Is that going to be the case? Maybe maybe not.

2098
03:38:45.200 --> 03:38:45.910
Orlando Sequera: But

2099
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:47.560
Orlando Sequera: when I have to make assumptions

2100
03:38:47.780 --> 03:39:02.159
Orlando Sequera: especially, we're working, following a predictive approach right? But we have to make some. We're going to have to make assumptions. We're going to have, we should try to be as accurate as possible with those assumptions, and that Benefits Management plan is also going to list

2101
03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:08.449
Orlando Sequera: the limitations that we have the constraints and risks at that level. But

2102
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:19.369
Orlando Sequera: this is all high level information. Okay, this is before your. This is before we get to the

2103
03:39:19.530 --> 03:39:32.210
Orlando Sequera: we have to. We have to do a deeper dive and work on the project. But this is at the Genesis stage of the project we haven't really started in planning. We're gonna do a deeper dive when it comes to to that.

2104
03:39:32.290 --> 03:39:32.970
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

2105
03:39:34.220 --> 03:39:35.350
Orlando Sequera: And

2106
03:39:37.660 --> 03:39:39.919
Orlando Sequera: some of the benefit measurement

2107
03:39:40.140 --> 03:39:42.000
Orlando Sequera: methods that we have

2108
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:51.020
Orlando Sequera: the cost-benefit analysis that's measuring. That's how many organizations are going to a

2109
03:39:51.040 --> 03:39:52.270
Orlando Sequera: determine

2110
03:39:53.310 --> 03:39:58.720
Orlando Sequera: based on the cost. This is this is how much it's going to cost me, and these are the benefits associated with that, and they

2111
03:39:59.130 --> 03:40:10.570
Orlando Sequera: more, the the the more benefits, less cost. That's usually the way, the way they do it. Okay, and that's how they justified their investment. That's one way. The cost benefit analysis.

2112
03:40:10.920 --> 03:40:12.759
Orlando Sequera: and they also have

2113
03:40:13.980 --> 03:40:17.030
Orlando Sequera: additional criteria. Most of this

2114
03:40:17.090 --> 03:40:18.900
Orlando Sequera: criteria are

2115
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:21.790
Orlando Sequera: financial metrics like

2116
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:30.869
Orlando Sequera: rest and value Future value. Net press of value. Return of investment that some of you mentioned internal rate of return. Hey?

2117
03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:43.289
Orlando Sequera: Something that you see here that is important and going to highlight, You might have that question. Do I need to learn the formula of present value for the Pmp. Exam. The answer is, no.

2118
03:40:43.450 --> 03:40:46.419
Orlando Sequera: But you need to know that

2119
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:49.930
Orlando Sequera: this is criteria that is used by

2120
03:40:50.190 --> 03:40:52.529
Orlando Sequera: organizations to determine

2121
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:55.369
Orlando Sequera: with, to select their projects.

2122
03:40:55.430 --> 03:41:08.789
Orlando Sequera: to select which projects are going to be conducted within the organization. Okay. And again, I'm talking about the genesis of a project. This is before even you as a Pm. Come into the picture right.

2123
03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:23.379
Orlando Sequera: But we're trying to understand what happens in that business environment. That's why we started with E. F. Opas we're starting to understand. That's why we're talking about strategic goals. There's a lot that happens before a project

2124
03:41:23.400 --> 03:41:27.649
Orlando Sequera: gets assigned to a Pm: okay, we to understand that because the better

2125
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:29.680
Orlando Sequera: the better we understand that

2126
03:41:29.820 --> 03:41:35.940
Orlando Sequera: the bet chances our chances of success are going to increase. This is happening that Genesis area.

2127
03:41:36.170 --> 03:41:37.150
Orlando Sequera: the project

2128
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:56.859
Orlando Sequera: doesn't exist. Officially. It's in that Genesis area Pre Pre project to give it a name, right? But it's happening in that environment. This is where do projects come from? This is answering that question. Remember, organizations are going to be. They have their strategic goals, and they need

2129
03:41:57.030 --> 03:42:03.109
Orlando Sequera: they use project management as a systematic way to conduct their projects.

2130
03:42:03.270 --> 03:42:03.890
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2131
03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:05.730
Orlando Sequera: then.

2132
03:42:06.740 --> 03:42:08.480
Orlando Sequera: this: these are

2133
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:26.239
Orlando Sequera: again financial metrics that many organizations use to determine the there to select their projects. Do not, do you? You do not? I'm gonna repeat it one more time. Do you do not need to calculate any of these financial metrics

2134
03:42:26.250 --> 03:42:43.019
Orlando Sequera: present value, future value, net present value? Do you do not need to calculate that for the Pmp. But you need to know that this is criteria used by organizations to select their projects. Another one is opportunity cost.

2135
03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:47.030
Orlando Sequera: What happens if we don't complete that project so.

2136
03:42:47.230 --> 03:42:50.590
Orlando Sequera: and the payback period the shorter time

2137
03:42:50.620 --> 03:42:53.230
Orlando Sequera: that's that's gonna be better right. So

2138
03:42:53.470 --> 03:42:57.900
Orlando Sequera: shorter pay back period the better, because that means that that's when we're going to start getting a profit.

2139
03:42:58.120 --> 03:43:01.589
Orlando Sequera: So this is criteria that is used.

2140
03:43:01.780 --> 03:43:02.930
Orlando Sequera: Patients to

2141
03:43:03.540 --> 03:43:05.610
Orlando Sequera: a select their projects

2142
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:11.589
Orlando Sequera: a little bit deeper explanation.

2143
03:43:12.300 --> 03:43:14.090
Orlando Sequera: a present value.

2144
03:43:14.170 --> 03:43:15.340
Orlando Sequera: It covers

2145
03:43:15.520 --> 03:43:18.860
Orlando Sequera: the several time periods. It could be months. It could be years

2146
03:43:19.210 --> 03:43:32.530
Orlando Sequera: when the value of money might change, and it takes into account, of course, taking to account factors like inflation, it, you need some piece of information to calculate present value. The interest rate

2147
03:43:32.770 --> 03:43:35.509
Orlando Sequera: is one of them. The number of periods, for example.

2148
03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:47.869
Orlando Sequera: and the future value. Net present value is used by organizations for capital budgeting, and it takes into account inflation and compa compares the value

2149
03:43:48.020 --> 03:43:48.800
Orlando Sequera: of

2150
03:43:49.050 --> 03:44:00.440
Orlando Sequera: $100 today the same currents to a $100 in the future. So it's gonna allow you to do that, and then organizations can make the decision based on that.

2151
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:04.919
Orlando Sequera: Okay, to select their projects. So it's about Project selection

2152
03:44:04.980 --> 03:44:10.860
Orlando Sequera: that's as far as you need to know, you do not need to know the actual, a

2153
03:44:11.690 --> 03:44:13.110
Orlando Sequera: the actual

2154
03:44:14.220 --> 03:44:32.689
Orlando Sequera: formulas for the Pmp. Exam: You're not gonna have a a question. How do you calculate the net person value. Given this re a 10% is the interest rate. And can you? No, no, that's out of go for the exam. However, you need to know the organizations use this financial metrics to select

2155
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:34.080
Orlando Sequera: their projects

2156
03:44:34.320 --> 03:44:42.779
Orlando Sequera: all right. So i'm gonna go over some questions in the Q. A. We had to pass the chat. It was getting a little bit out of control.

2157
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:47.369
Orlando Sequera: But please vote on the questions that you feel

2158
03:44:49.940 --> 03:44:54.519
Orlando Sequera: the If you have the same question, vote on the questions, and that will

2159
03:44:54.810 --> 03:44:58.629
Orlando Sequera: bump it up, and we'll make sure that he gets addressed.

2160
03:45:00.670 --> 03:45:03.320
Orlando Sequera: All right. A.

2161
03:45:06.640 --> 03:45:13.180
Orlando Sequera: Oh, this one here this is from from earlier. I'm gonna i'm gonna address it, because even though it was from the previous break.

2162
03:45:13.270 --> 03:45:18.950
Orlando Sequera: If you don't pass the exam of the first try, can you take it. Yes, but there's a cost associated with that.

2163
03:45:21.500 --> 03:45:28.269
Orlando Sequera: Okay, i'm gonna go to the is this: there's another question in the Q. A. Is this gate? 0?

2164
03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:37.990
Orlando Sequera: Hmm. I'm. Not familiar with that, Kate 0. But this is a genesis. I'm gonna venture to say yes is what happens before the projects have been selected.

2165
03:45:44.320 --> 03:45:48.150
Orlando Sequera: Why only quantify? Because you have to be able to measure the benefits

2166
03:45:55.620 --> 03:45:56.680
Orlando Sequera: right?

2167
03:45:57.830 --> 03:46:03.790
Orlando Sequera: This Kate 0, I'll have to double check on that, as I mentioned. But it. What happens at the very beginning number

2168
03:46:03.870 --> 03:46:06.460
Orlando Sequera: tempted to say Yes, but i'll have to double check.

2169
03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:09.550
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2170
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:24.480
Orlando Sequera: all right, I think.

2171
03:46:28.610 --> 03:46:29.570
Orlando Sequera: A:

2172
03:46:33.780 --> 03:46:34.610
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2173
03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:37.289
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the chat.

2174
03:46:38.540 --> 03:46:41.180
Orlando Sequera: This project, Genesis, the term we'll see in the Exam. Note.

2175
03:46:41.260 --> 03:46:41.830
Nope.

2176
03:46:41.980 --> 03:46:44.499
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Just trying to explain that it's before

2177
03:46:44.980 --> 03:46:46.639
Orlando Sequera: the projects are born

2178
03:46:47.140 --> 03:46:48.240
Orlando Sequera: and select it

2179
03:46:52.500 --> 03:46:53.100
Orlando Sequera: and

2180
03:46:59.170 --> 03:47:02.369
Orlando Sequera: present value, and at present value

2181
03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:09.200
Orlando Sequera: list inflation as examples. Not here. Not sure how these values differ. Again, what you need to

2182
03:47:09.500 --> 03:47:11.680
Orlando Sequera: remember for the exam. We're i'm going to

2183
03:47:11.950 --> 03:47:21.530
Orlando Sequera: highlight that in scope for the exam is to understand that there are multiple metrics, financial metrics. In this case that organizations use to

2184
03:47:22.200 --> 03:47:23.600
Orlando Sequera: select projects

2185
03:47:23.890 --> 03:47:27.289
Orlando Sequera: press invalid. They want to make sure that they get the best

2186
03:47:27.430 --> 03:47:30.009
Orlando Sequera: bank for their book, the best, the most

2187
03:47:30.150 --> 03:47:31.470
Orlando Sequera: a profit

2188
03:47:31.490 --> 03:47:50.860
Orlando Sequera: for their investment. That's what they're looking for in the shorter amount the shortest amount of time possible. So they once I have a higher person, value and net present value in a shorter timeframe. Those are the projects that most likely are going to be selected. That's as far as that's as far as as you need to go when it comes to this metrics and the shorter payback period.

2189
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:51.560
Orlando Sequera: of course.

2190
03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:55.110
Orlando Sequera: and the higher return of investment, of course.

2191
03:47:55.470 --> 03:47:57.450
Orlando Sequera: So that's what you need to.

2192
03:47:59.180 --> 03:48:03.830
Orlando Sequera: That's as far as you need. Please Remember, it's a Pmp. Exam class.

2193
03:48:08.080 --> 03:48:13.039
Orlando Sequera: Do companies try to predict inflation or use a historical leverage that's out of scope for the class.

2194
03:48:13.610 --> 03:48:16.469
Orlando Sequera: That's probably an accounting question.

2195
03:48:16.720 --> 03:48:23.029
Orlando Sequera: I'm sure they have ways to predict inflation or but that is out of scope for the Pmp extent.

2196
03:48:26.090 --> 03:48:36.250
Orlando Sequera: Do. We need business business case by an analyst in agile approach at least a little bit different. But you do need to have some background.

2197
03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:45.439
Orlando Sequera: You do need to have. Yes, for both you. You do need to have some justification, regardless of the approach that happens later. But yes, you need a business case.

2198
03:48:45.540 --> 03:48:48.509
Orlando Sequera: a justification for the project. Absolutely

2199
03:48:55.100 --> 03:49:01.030
Orlando Sequera: another question in the Q. A. Is it the project sponsor Who does the project? Selection

2200
03:49:02.580 --> 03:49:07.250
Orlando Sequera: not necessarily depends on the organization. It could be

2201
03:49:07.920 --> 03:49:14.220
Orlando Sequera: a board. It really depends on the organization. That's why you need to know your organizational structure and how

2202
03:49:14.510 --> 03:49:27.319
Orlando Sequera: the how to navigate that environment. It changes. It could be the Pmo. It could be a group of people, a board, a governing, a steering committee, a a a governance board. So it really depends on the organization.

2203
03:49:29.930 --> 03:49:41.210
Orlando Sequera: That's correct Sponsor, Big Mp: Remember, this is not just the proxy sponsor. This is the organization Selecting projects is before a sponsor is assigned, but organizations usually pick them.

2204
03:49:41.470 --> 03:49:46.819
Orlando Sequera: Projects select projects that have a higher net person value. Yes.

2205
03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:56.799
Orlando Sequera: another question can. The project just is in the Q. A can the pro justification be based on the time, safe and list number resources used

2206
03:49:57.270 --> 03:50:00.250
Orlando Sequera: absolutely in some cases? Yes.

2207
03:50:10.080 --> 03:50:14.709
Orlando Sequera: there's another question how to measure intangible? It's a little bit more cumbersome but

2208
03:50:15.010 --> 03:50:18.670
Orlando Sequera: positive impact brand recognition. It's a little bit more

2209
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:21.809
Orlando Sequera: difficult challenging to measure intangibles

2210
03:50:22.290 --> 03:50:29.349
Orlando Sequera: like those, for example. But there are way customer, satisfaction, index nps could be a way to do that

2211
03:50:29.380 --> 03:50:36.019
Orlando Sequera: so satisfactory with surveys and satisfaction surveys. There are ways to even measure those intangibles.

2212
03:50:36.460 --> 03:50:42.119
Orlando Sequera: It's a little bit more challenging, and you might have to use more tools and techniques for that. But it is possible

2213
03:50:45.330 --> 03:50:58.619
Orlando Sequera: it's another question in the Q. A. As a project manager. What responsibility do we assume for pitch and justified? This is before you come into the picture. This is your this is happening before you actually come into the into the picture.

2214
03:50:58.740 --> 03:50:59.560
Orlando Sequera: So

2215
03:51:00.010 --> 03:51:03.080
Orlando Sequera: this is the sponsor and the decision-makers at

2216
03:51:03.100 --> 03:51:08.890
Orlando Sequera: the higher level. And the but there! What we need to know how that project selection happens.

2217
03:51:08.910 --> 03:51:11.100
Orlando Sequera: The more we know about it, the

2218
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:15.140
Orlando Sequera: 10 we're going to increase our chances for success.

2219
03:51:20.290 --> 03:51:21.810
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2220
03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:25.920
Orlando Sequera: okay.

2221
03:51:36.650 --> 03:51:49.069
Orlando Sequera: there's another question in the chat. How can we verify accuracy of the business value plan? This is case that's what you're gonna do with your project? We're we're that's way far ahead with the project. Not right. Now. We're talking about project selection.

2222
03:51:49.530 --> 03:51:50.350
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2223
03:51:52.490 --> 03:51:53.900
Orlando Sequera: We also have

2224
03:51:57.360 --> 03:52:04.210
Orlando Sequera: objectives and key results, and these okay, ours can help us to deliver business value.

2225
03:52:04.300 --> 03:52:08.030
Orlando Sequera: So we usually start with this strategic planning

2226
03:52:08.700 --> 03:52:11.810
Orlando Sequera: following the organizational objectives. And then

2227
03:52:11.850 --> 03:52:23.200
Orlando Sequera: we should understand and work or organizations are gonna Organizations are going to decide which are the desire key results that can be achieved by programs or projects. So by.

2228
03:52:23.250 --> 03:52:42.189
Orlando Sequera: as I mentioned before, an example reduced or increase the level of efficiency of financial and accounting operations by 20. That's an example of organizational objective, and the key desired result could be Well, we would like to increase the level of efficiency of accounting processes by 20%.

2229
03:52:42.600 --> 03:52:46.880
Orlando Sequera: And that's what's that's what's gonna help us to come up with an all Kr

2230
03:52:47.040 --> 03:52:49.620
Orlando Sequera: objective and key results, and

2231
03:52:49.710 --> 03:52:54.370
Orlando Sequera: these objectives are going to be those goals and intense. And we can then further refine that.

2232
03:52:54.490 --> 03:52:55.890
Orlando Sequera: with our goal of

2233
03:52:56.360 --> 03:53:01.289
Orlando Sequera: increasing the efficiency of the accounting department by 20%, and we can

2234
03:53:01.370 --> 03:53:08.020
Orlando Sequera: measure that we can. It has to be a achievable. It has to be a feasible.

2235
03:53:08.070 --> 03:53:16.380
Orlando Sequera: It has to be, we have to be able to measure it so we can then come up with milestones on under those goals, on intents that we have

2236
03:53:16.530 --> 03:53:23.740
Orlando Sequera: some of the best practices that organization should follow. When it comes to okay, ours or objectives and key results.

2237
03:53:24.410 --> 03:53:26.929
Orlando Sequera: we should have each objective

2238
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:31.059
Orlando Sequera: have it supported by 3 to 5

2239
03:53:31.080 --> 03:53:33.289
Orlando Sequera: measurable key results.

2240
03:53:33.620 --> 03:53:37.920
Orlando Sequera: and then we should AIM for a 70% success rate

2241
03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:40.670
Orlando Sequera: to encourage competitive gold, making

2242
03:53:40.850 --> 03:53:46.950
Orlando Sequera: a 100% success rate should be evaluated as because it might mean that we're it's not challenging enough.

2243
03:53:47.170 --> 03:53:53.309
Orlando Sequera: And then okay, ours should be action oriented. That's gonna help with motivation and inspiration

2244
03:53:53.780 --> 03:54:04.210
Orlando Sequera: for the rest of the organization, but they should include concrete and measurable outcomes. Okay, so this is how we start tying up our individual

2245
03:54:04.360 --> 03:54:09.720
Orlando Sequera: goals and objectives of our individual initiatives, projects with those

2246
03:54:10.160 --> 03:54:13.269
Orlando Sequera: objectives and key results that the organizations have.

2247
03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:18.730
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2248
03:54:19.150 --> 03:54:21.529
Orlando Sequera: i'm going to review

2249
03:54:23.970 --> 03:54:26.019
Orlando Sequera: any additional questions that

2250
03:54:31.450 --> 03:54:32.330
Orlando Sequera: all right?

2251
03:54:34.040 --> 03:54:35.140
Orlando Sequera: And

2252
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:38.740
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2253
03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:41.080
Orlando Sequera: value delivery.

2254
03:54:41.430 --> 03:54:43.610
Orlando Sequera: we don't have to.

2255
03:54:46.720 --> 03:54:49.790
Orlando Sequera: We we don't have to deliver necessarily

2256
03:54:50.130 --> 03:54:57.929
Orlando Sequera: all the value doesn't have to be delivered at the end of the project. Necessarily we can deliver an increment

2257
03:54:58.020 --> 03:55:07.939
Orlando Sequera: we can deliver in increments, and that's why agile that's one of the key aspects of Agile, for example, agile is built in a way that allows

2258
03:55:08.940 --> 03:55:13.960
Orlando Sequera: project teams that allows organizations to deliver value.

2259
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:15.840
Orlando Sequera: Incrementally.

2260
03:55:16.490 --> 03:55:29.290
Orlando Sequera: it's a. It's a framework that allows an an approach. It's an approach that allows organizations to deliver value and commit the meaning that you don't have to wait it's. Assume that your project is to build a new, a

2261
03:55:29.420 --> 03:55:39.669
Orlando Sequera: a new type of electric car. You don't have to wait until the actual completed car is billed to start and in value you might be doing an increments.

2262
03:55:39.940 --> 03:55:47.239
Orlando Sequera: Okay, or just starting to the or let's go back to the example of the software for the accounting department.

2263
03:55:48.050 --> 03:55:54.590
Orlando Sequera: Following an incremental approach, we can start delivering pieces of functionality

2264
03:55:55.070 --> 03:56:01.670
Orlando Sequera: in increments, one iteration at a time every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks a week for weeks

2265
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:16.319
Orlando Sequera: that the business can start using in production and start benefit, they can start benefiting from those from that functionality. Perhaps reports that right now take them a. Let's assume, for example, that one of the main

2266
03:56:17.130 --> 03:56:27.940
Orlando Sequera: a headache that that, or pain points that you're that they are currently, primarily suffering right now is that it takes them 3 days to generate a monthly sales report

2267
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:34.560
Orlando Sequera: 3 full days to run the monthly sales report. So with our software. If that is

2268
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:46.450
Orlando Sequera: at the top of the functionality that we have to deliver. That's one of the that is the main that that is the most important functionality that we have to deliver in that particular iteration. We can

2269
03:56:46.470 --> 03:56:47.380
Orlando Sequera: then

2270
03:56:47.600 --> 03:56:49.170
Orlando Sequera: build that functionality

2271
03:56:50.080 --> 03:56:53.639
Orlando Sequera: that can be deployed to production, and they can start working

2272
03:56:54.280 --> 03:56:59.420
Orlando Sequera: and generating that monthly sales report. And now, with a new software. It might only take them

2273
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:10.539
Orlando Sequera: a half an hour or 2 h. So you're reducing the 3 days to just a half an hour. That's one way that. That's how we can

2274
03:57:10.650 --> 03:57:20.459
Orlando Sequera: that it's an example of incremental value delivery that's gonna help you to enable value delivery sooner. You don't have to wait until the entire account in software is completed.

2275
03:57:20.880 --> 03:57:22.849
Orlando Sequera: It's also going to help you

2276
03:57:23.240 --> 03:57:23.980
Orlando Sequera: to

2277
03:57:24.670 --> 03:57:39.889
Orlando Sequera: attain a higher customer value and increase market share, because this is, there's a timing consideration here, and you can. You can do a delivery partial delivery, and that's what's gonna help you to pay what to change to make changes.

2278
03:57:40.010 --> 03:57:57.859
Orlando Sequera: Change the course if you have to change the course, because you're going to have a pivot pivotal points in between iterations that can allow you and the team to make modifications to change the course if needed, and it also helps you to get feedback early. They don't have to

2279
03:57:58.180 --> 03:58:15.240
Orlando Sequera: your stakeholders the accounting department they don't have to wait until the entire software is built before they can provide you with feedback. So that's what's gonna help you to change course. And this is Specifically, this is why Agile helps you to navigate a situations in which there's a lot of changes

2280
03:58:15.630 --> 03:58:21.619
Orlando Sequera: that this is going to be your best bet, and it really helps with adding value

2281
03:58:22.370 --> 03:58:23.879
Orlando Sequera: in a timely manner.

2282
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:28.360
Orlando Sequera: All right. Let me review

2286
03:58:37.850 --> 03:58:38.900

2290
03:58:48.230 --> 03:58:53.840
Orlando Sequera: questions that are related to the to the content. And i'm going to try

2291
03:58:53.920 --> 03:58:57.020
Orlando Sequera: to answer some of the questions in your

2292
03:58:58.680 --> 03:58:59.920
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. A.

2293
03:59:08.270 --> 03:59:10.670
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the chat.

2294
03:59:12.730 --> 03:59:21.010
Orlando Sequera: What are some examples of implementing incremental value delivery. That's what I just mentioned. With the accounting software. We don't have to wait until the entire.

2295
03:59:21.620 --> 03:59:23.579
Orlando Sequera: That's a question in the chat. By the way.

2296
03:59:23.960 --> 03:59:30.099
Orlando Sequera: where are some examples of implementing incremental value delivery? Well, that's one. You can deliver that functionality.

2297
03:59:30.190 --> 03:59:31.390
Orlando Sequera: a of

2298
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:34.980
Orlando Sequera: being able to create a monthly sales report

2299
03:59:35.450 --> 03:59:44.570
Orlando Sequera: right now. You don't have to wait on You don't have to wait 6 months until the entire so new a accounting software is completed. That's an example of it

2300
03:59:45.770 --> 03:59:48.080
Orlando Sequera: is the incremental value delivery

2301
03:59:48.190 --> 03:59:56.600
Orlando Sequera: only relevant to adaptive model. Not necessarily that's another question in the chat. Not necessarily, but it really helps

2302
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:59.889
Orlando Sequera: it's. It's crucial when it comes to

2303
04:00:01.360 --> 04:00:07.520
Orlando Sequera: a to navigating situations of high complexity or a lot of changes that's

2304
04:00:07.800 --> 04:00:08.780
Orlando Sequera: This is

2305
04:00:09.380 --> 04:00:21.000
Orlando Sequera: not only applicable to to to agile to adaptive is also applicable to predictive. Remember, that is tied up to adding value, regardless of the approach, is tied up to

2306
04:00:21.360 --> 04:00:31.570
Orlando Sequera: the definition of success for any project, regardless of the approach, whether it's predictive or whether it is an active or agile or hybrid. Okay. But

2307
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:34.809
Orlando Sequera: what I was trying to point out. Is that

2308
04:00:36.520 --> 04:00:45.629
Orlando Sequera: adaptive or agile, has a built in framework that allows you it's already a. You have the

2309
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:54.600
Orlando Sequera: it's like plug and play. It's already there for you if you're going to be facing situations in which you you navigate a lot of changes.

2310
04:00:54.730 --> 04:01:03.639
Orlando Sequera: All this incremental value. Delivery is is built in basically building functionality in that approach that will help you to make sure that a

2311
04:01:04.320 --> 04:01:11.170
Orlando Sequera: generating value is achievable in those situations. But regardless of the approach you should focus on adding value

2312
04:01:12.170 --> 04:01:13.070
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2313
04:01:15.100 --> 04:01:18.339
Orlando Sequera: If another question in the chat.

2314
04:01:18.500 --> 04:01:37.880
Orlando Sequera: does the Pm. Have a role in defining and measuring the value of the project, or that the Pm. Simply execute. Remember what I mentioned before, and that was mentioned before. Value is defined by the business, by the stakeholders, not by you. The Pm: Not by the team members. Okay, and that's usually something that

2315
04:01:38.220 --> 04:01:56.999
Orlando Sequera: we have to really make sure and coach our team members because they might have different perspectives. Usually team members are very smart people, and there's they in some cases, and I have seen it Witness that personally they try to. Oh, they don't really know what they want. This is what they really want. No, that's not how it works.

2316
04:01:57.010 --> 04:02:00.299
Orlando Sequera: We value is device. Whatever is

2317
04:02:01.690 --> 04:02:03.010
Orlando Sequera: value is

2318
04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:06.079
Orlando Sequera: defined by the stakeholders by

2319
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:10.700
Orlando Sequera: the organization, by the business, not by the team, not by you, as the Pm.

2320
04:02:11.960 --> 04:02:13.519
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

2321
04:02:14.610 --> 04:02:18.599
Orlando Sequera: You're gonna get access to recordings. Remember? That goes in the Q. A.

2322
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:24.330
Orlando Sequera: Another question as to the incremental value delivery. Is this a face? It?

2323
04:02:25.440 --> 04:02:33.100
Orlando Sequera: No, it is not a face in the in the project of determining the product. The project. This is something. This is one of your

2324
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:37.369
Orlando Sequera: This is ongoing in your project. Life cycle

2325
04:02:43.100 --> 04:02:48.949
Orlando Sequera: are the okay are established during needs assessment. Yes, before before projects are selected. Yes.

2326
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:50.440
Orlando Sequera: that's another question in the chat.

2327
04:02:50.580 --> 04:02:54.019
Orlando Sequera: Please change your blue box to everyone, so everyone can see your question.

2328
04:02:56.610 --> 04:02:58.599
Orlando Sequera: I've been trying to read the questions.

2329
04:02:59.700 --> 04:03:02.410
Orlando Sequera: It's pressure it on right

2330
04:03:03.600 --> 04:03:09.169
Orlando Sequera: another. There's a comment. If for charity, Don't write, the Charter will help in making that determination.

2331
04:03:09.230 --> 04:03:14.760
Orlando Sequera: No, the pro charter happens after the project has been selected. These are.

2332
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:17.679
Orlando Sequera: this happens before projects are selected.

2333
04:03:19.650 --> 04:03:21.050
Orlando Sequera: A.

2334
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:25.550
Okay.

2335
04:03:28.280 --> 04:03:34.230
Orlando Sequera: it might make more sense to use it for contact questions. That's what we were trying to do. But he got a little bit better. Hands

2336
04:03:35.420 --> 04:03:40.030
Orlando Sequera: burn down chart. We're not talking. That's we Haven't mentioned that. Please stay on topic.

2337
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.920
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2338
04:03:45.760 --> 04:03:57.289
Orlando Sequera: let's use the Q. And a. For content. Related questions. Vote on the questions. If you're able to do that, you're gonna help me. Okay, I'm trying to do my best to answer your questions.

2339
04:03:57.710 --> 04:04:00.140
Orlando Sequera: But let's

2340
04:04:00.650 --> 04:04:03.690
Orlando Sequera: Let's stick to the content. Let's stick to the content.

2341
04:04:06.960 --> 04:04:08.940
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat

2342
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:14.329
Orlando Sequera: can value of all this project works. Yes, it can change absolutely that can change

2343
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:27.030
Orlando Sequera: It's probably manager, one of stakeholders. Yes, but we're going to talk about the stakeholders in detail. Absolutely.

2344
04:04:35.100 --> 04:04:41.350
Orlando Sequera: That's the another question in the chat. That's the price charter helping form the project manager. The value of the project. It's

2345
04:04:41.480 --> 04:04:56.509
Orlando Sequera: the best analogy or the project. Charter is a birth certificate. It has high level information about yes, about the benefits and values of the project, but it's way much more than just that, and that happens after the project is selected. Remember that we're talking about

2346
04:04:56.620 --> 04:05:04.630
Orlando Sequera: the justification of the project. It happens before the pro. The project has been selected. That is the birth certificate. Okay.

2347
04:05:04.940 --> 04:05:05.750
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2348
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.720
Orlando Sequera: So

2349
04:05:07.280 --> 04:05:09.720

2350
04:05:10.130 --> 04:05:14.310
Orlando Sequera: the ones that get more more vote in the Q. And a. Are going to be answered.

2351
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:34.860
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat can basically find basis value. I have said 2 s ago that value is defined by the stakeholders, by the organization, not by a business analyst or a project manager or team members. I just mentioned that

2352
04:05:35.430 --> 04:05:38.020
Orlando Sequera: they can help, but they don't define value.

2353
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:41.090
Orlando Sequera: Value comes from the business

2354
04:05:43.480 --> 04:05:44.369
Orlando Sequera: right?

2355
04:05:52.180 --> 04:05:55.819
Orlando Sequera: Can the Va. Be considered perfect team? Yes, you can work with specialists. Yes.

2356
04:05:58.290 --> 04:05:59.199
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2357
04:05:59.280 --> 04:06:06.770
Orlando Sequera: So far we have been continue. So far we have been covering

2358
04:06:06.820 --> 04:06:12.419
Orlando Sequera: the benefits, the val we have been talking about, evaluating and delivering project benefits and value.

2359
04:06:12.440 --> 04:06:14.730
Orlando Sequera: We have been also talking about

2360
04:06:14.800 --> 04:06:16.950
Orlando Sequera: how to investigate those benefits.

2361
04:06:17.540 --> 04:06:22.680
Orlando Sequera: They are going to be identified and to validate delivery options to deliver value.

2362
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:25.309
Orlando Sequera: That's where that incremental value.

2363
04:06:25.340 --> 04:06:31.479
Orlando Sequera: A approach comes into play. If you're navigating a situation in which there are multiple changes.

2364
04:06:31.600 --> 04:06:33.319
Orlando Sequera: that if it's going to be your

2365
04:06:33.380 --> 04:06:34.320
Orlando Sequera: best bet

2366
04:06:34.460 --> 04:06:35.320
Orlando Sequera: agile

2367
04:06:36.020 --> 04:06:37.879
Orlando Sequera: because it enables you.

2368
04:06:38.450 --> 04:06:40.420
Orlando Sequera: in a in an easier way

2369
04:06:40.580 --> 04:06:56.980
Orlando Sequera: to provide incremental value delivery to options to your stakeholders. Okay, so that's why that evaluation and process Eval, you're evaluating here the best approach that you can follow to add value to your stakeholders.

2370
04:06:57.060 --> 04:06:58.150
Orlando Sequera: and then

2371
04:06:59.010 --> 04:07:17.690
Orlando Sequera: you should. We also win over a how to execute the project with the urgency required to deliver this value. So it's about looking at opportunities to deliver value incrementally important for you extend. This is coming from your exam. Content outline. This is what we cover, how these topics are related to

2372
04:07:17.700 --> 04:07:37.030
Orlando Sequera: the exam container. This is what you have to watch out for, and I saw some questions about the PIN book, please. The ping book is one of many references. What you really have to focus on is the exam content outline. And we're going to be going over throughout the class to see how the concept that we're covering relate

2373
04:07:37.040 --> 04:07:49.839
Orlando Sequera: to the exam content outline. That's your syllables, Not the PIN box is the exam. Content out of the people. It's already still into this content you have to pay attention to the exam. Content outline. Okay.

2374
04:07:53.160 --> 04:07:57.110
Orlando Sequera: Eco. Stands for exam content outline. I just mentioned that

2375
04:07:58.260 --> 04:07:59.110
Orlando Sequera: we

2376
04:07:59.770 --> 04:08:03.340
Orlando Sequera: I don't know 5 s ago. So it's the same content outline all right.

2377
04:08:03.620 --> 04:08:10.920
Orlando Sequera: Yes, it's some content outline. That is what you have to review, and you can find the exam Content Outline in

2378
04:08:11.550 --> 04:08:16.750
Orlando Sequera: the resource, tab, or in Github. That is what you have to review.

2379
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:23.619
Orlando Sequera: The has the 3 domains that we're covering. That's what you have to review. Not the PIN, but not

2380
04:08:23.710 --> 04:08:30.880
Orlando Sequera: the other references. That's what you're gonna be tested on. That's why it's so important to review the exam. Content outline. Okay.

2381
04:08:31.360 --> 04:08:32.220
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2382
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:34.340
Orlando Sequera: A:

2383
04:08:39.680 --> 04:08:42.920
Orlando Sequera: All right. So now we're going to continue with the next topic.

2384
04:08:43.220 --> 04:08:45.400
Orlando Sequera: As we have mentioned before.

2385
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:51.779
Orlando Sequera: we have mentioned before, the goal that we have with projects is to create and deliver change.

2386
04:08:52.430 --> 04:08:53.449
Orlando Sequera: add value

2387
04:08:53.860 --> 04:08:55.039
Orlando Sequera: deliver change.

2388
04:08:55.310 --> 04:08:56.510
Orlando Sequera: That is

2389
04:08:56.660 --> 04:09:07.260
Orlando Sequera: usually the catalyst. That factors is going to accelerate the authorization of a project. Okay, and Pmi. In most cases

2390
04:09:08.250 --> 04:09:10.979
Orlando Sequera: that's why Pmi has

2391
04:09:11.150 --> 04:09:12.170
Orlando Sequera: a

2392
04:09:12.390 --> 04:09:17.210
Orlando Sequera: they call project professionals change makers because it's about change.

2393
04:09:17.430 --> 04:09:25.700
Orlando Sequera: Change is probably the biggest factor when it comes to business decision. Then we're gonna take a break in a minute. We're gonna take a break in a in a minute. So

2394
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:28.449
Orlando Sequera: that's why they call them

2395
04:09:28.530 --> 04:09:37.649
Orlando Sequera: change Makers project. Managers are also known as change makers. We're making change come to making it. We're making it happen. Okay, with our projects

2396
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:38.710
Orlando Sequera: in

2397
04:09:39.520 --> 04:09:41.679
Orlando Sequera: That's why it's so important to understand

2398
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:52.790
Orlando Sequera: that our projects are not done in a vacuum. They're done in an organization for an organization, and that's why it's so important that we are aligned with

2399
04:09:52.800 --> 04:10:12.530
Orlando Sequera: the business objective that we have access to that bigger picture. Because that is your environment. Your project is gonna be. No, it's not done in a vacuum. You are part of that larger ecosystem that we call organization. Okay, and that's why we have to follow a systematic approach for project management. We have

2400
04:10:12.540 --> 04:10:17.829
Orlando Sequera: A, as we know we have enterprise, environmental factors. We have opa.

2401
04:10:18.490 --> 04:10:23.720
Orlando Sequera: We need to take those into account, and we also need to understand

2402
04:10:24.570 --> 04:10:26.690
Orlando Sequera: it. Change management

2403
04:10:27.100 --> 04:10:42.489
Orlando Sequera: apply to our organization. This is not the same as change control management. We're we're gonna talk about change control manager later. This is about change management, how things are done, how things, how changes are implemented within

2404
04:10:42.500 --> 04:10:47.329
Orlando Sequera: the organization? How do they work? How do they

2405
04:10:47.360 --> 04:11:06.019
Orlando Sequera: depending on the industry depending on the organization, the values of the organization that intel that you need to have about the organization, that system of beliefs and values. And that's why it that's why it's so important. This takes time with specially, and I can tell you from my own experience, the larger the organization.

2406
04:11:06.320 --> 04:11:25.730
Orlando Sequera: one of the biggest challenges that you have as a Pm. Regardless of your the the type of industry is to be able to figure out the organizational culture, especially when you're new to the organization. Take some time. Understand? That's going to help you to understand the power relationships, the key players, how things are done, and this is

2407
04:11:25.740 --> 04:11:29.559
Orlando Sequera: part of that tribal knowledge that you need to have

2408
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:30.420

2410
04:11:37.890 --> 04:11:48.990
Orlando Sequera: You're not gonna find that in in an opa. A. It's not part of your onboarding process as a new employee. You have to figure that out. You gotta ask questions. If there is a Pmo in place.

2411
04:11:49.090 --> 04:11:57.619
Orlando Sequera: Talk to them. You need to understand. You get a get up to speed quickly on how things are done in the organization, they

2412
04:11:57.720 --> 04:12:05.379
Orlando Sequera: the key players. And basically to understand the system of belief that takes time. It's easier said than done. Bodies

2425
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:17.140
Orlando Sequera: if the chat starts getting out of control. I'm going to pass it

2426
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:20.600
Orlando Sequera: A. But

2427
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:26.360
Orlando Sequera: ideally, we want to give you as many opportunities as possible for you to ask questions.

2428
04:13:26.450 --> 04:13:33.759
Orlando Sequera: But if we use the Q. And a. For what it is as we sent earlier in the class today, if you have technical issues.

2429
04:13:33.920 --> 04:13:36.529
Orlando Sequera: Please, please, please let us know.

2430

2432
04:13:58.950 --> 04:14:03.910
Orlando Sequera: the goal that we had originally with it, with the at the beginning of the class, was

2433
04:14:04.020 --> 04:14:06.980
Orlando Sequera: for those of you that had Content related questions.

2434

Orlando Sequera: What for all of you to see the questions and then vote on those questions. Okay, so we can. So we can then answer the actual.

2435
04:14:17.120 --> 04:14:33.349
Orlando Sequera: The questions I get the most vote. As we said before, I want to remind you another guideline. It is impossible to answer every single question we're doing our best. I'm doing my best to review both the chat and the Q. A. But

2436
04:14:33.890 --> 04:14:48.040
Orlando Sequera: as we go up we also have to cover the Content right board. Help me in voting for those questions. Help me also with standing questions related to the content that we are covering. We're not here to

2437
04:14:48.920 --> 04:14:58.739

Orlando Sequera: and the

2466
04:18:36.280 --> 04:18:37.270
Orlando Sequera: Let's

2467
04:18:37.560 --> 04:18:39.049
Orlando Sequera: use the Q. And a

2470
04:18:58.370 --> 04:18:59.700
Orlando Sequera: the Pmp. Exempt.

2471
04:18:59.800 --> 04:19:00.600
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2472
04:19:07.110 --> 04:19:09.099
Orlando Sequera: as I was mentioning before.

2473
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:21.850
Orlando Sequera: This is an important topic. This is the the essential culture. We need to understand that it takes time easier set than done. It takes time special if you're new to the organization, and

2474
04:19:21.980 --> 04:19:23.679
Orlando Sequera: if you are.

2475
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:32.550
Orlando Sequera: if you're new to the organization, if you're new to project management as well. It takes time. This is about knowing the key players how things are done. This is part of that tribal knowledge

2476
04:19:32.560 --> 04:19:48.220
Orlando Sequera: that you're not gonna be able to. It's not gonna be written in that onboarding documentation. It is not written in a policy. You have to learn that because this is gonna have an impact on the way your projects are conducted. It is

2477
04:19:48.520 --> 04:19:54.080
Orlando Sequera: enterprise, environmental factor. As we said before, it is an internal enterprise, environmental fact.

2478
04:19:54.400 --> 04:20:00.579
Orlando Sequera: and also to understand change management. But this is what we mean by change.

2479
04:20:00.600 --> 04:20:01.300
Richmond.

2480
04:20:08.140 --> 04:20:09.350
Orlando Sequera: It is

2481
04:20:11.200 --> 04:20:16.190
Orlando Sequera: they how organizations embrace, change as a strategy.

2482
04:20:16.280 --> 04:20:18.410
Orlando Sequera: Some of them are

2483
04:20:19.620 --> 04:20:21.240
Orlando Sequera: resistant to changes.

2484
04:20:21.280 --> 04:20:23.149
Orlando Sequera: Some of them embrace.

2485
04:20:23.420 --> 04:20:24.930
Orlando Sequera: change in

2486
04:20:27.360 --> 04:20:29.479
Orlando Sequera: embrace, change.

2487
04:20:29.560 --> 04:20:31.010
Orlando Sequera: email more.

2488
04:20:31.410 --> 04:20:49.090
Orlando Sequera: They're more conducive to change. They embrace, change. Basically Some of them are reluctant to change. So we need to understand that we need to understand that one key resource that will help us to understand that is going to be relying on the Pmo. They can help you to

2489
04:20:49.100 --> 04:21:05.009
Orlando Sequera: understand the alignment between your projects and the organization. Pmos that are great resources. You have one, please. By all means make sure that you're relying on the organization. Okay, that you rely on the Pmo. To understand the organization.

2490
04:21:05.390 --> 04:21:07.729
Orlando Sequera: this organization of culture is

2491
04:21:07.880 --> 04:21:13.039
Orlando Sequera: he and change management their key factors when it comes to project success or failure

2492
04:21:13.390 --> 04:21:14.360
Orlando Sequera: in

2493
04:21:15.380 --> 04:21:23.890
Orlando Sequera: this is one key aspect of project management per say, is being able to work with other people, being able to

2494
04:21:24.860 --> 04:21:28.620
Orlando Sequera: lead projects in a way that they drive

2495
04:21:28.930 --> 04:21:42.119
Orlando Sequera: changes in a changing environment. Right? We're trying to drive changes in a changing environment. We to be able to navigate that, and we need to be able to position our project teams

2496
04:21:43.270 --> 04:21:46.979
Orlando Sequera: in a way that they are successful. Things are going to be changing.

2497
04:21:47.080 --> 04:21:50.479
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to organizational culture

2498
04:21:50.820 --> 04:22:05.420
Orlando Sequera: key players they can change. They can be removed. They can. We can have new players. We need to understand all those different relationships that's part of that ecosystem that we have to navigate as project managers that's gonna have an impact on

2499
04:22:05.640 --> 04:22:06.720
Orlando Sequera: success

2500
04:22:06.860 --> 04:22:10.799
Orlando Sequera: and failure for that matter for a project. So we really need to have

2501
04:22:10.930 --> 04:22:12.740
Orlando Sequera: that a

2502
04:22:13.420 --> 04:22:17.439
Orlando Sequera: that actual understanding, it takes time. It takes time

2503
04:22:18.180 --> 04:22:23.360
Orlando Sequera: it Some organizations they embrace change. As I mentioned before. Some of them

2504
04:22:23.900 --> 04:22:31.159
Orlando Sequera: are reluctant to changes, so we need to understand that what type of organization are we working with?

2505
04:22:31.220 --> 04:22:42.489
Orlando Sequera: If your organization, as I mentioned before the key resource for you to navigate. This is gonna be a Pmo. If the organization has a Pmo. In place.

2506
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:44.289
Orlando Sequera: you can

2507
04:22:44.320 --> 04:22:47.329
Orlando Sequera: go to the Pmo. Get access to

2508
04:22:47.450 --> 04:22:48.160
Orlando Sequera: the

2509
04:22:49.010 --> 04:23:02.650
Orlando Sequera: guidelines, the templates, the documentation templates that you need to use for your projects that usually it's going to be. It's. It's going to be available to you, but also they are going to be.

2510
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:04.300
Orlando Sequera: They're going to be

2511
04:23:05.420 --> 04:23:13.680
Orlando Sequera: available. They're gonna be able to provide you with that guidance in understanding the organizational culture, understanding the organization.

2512
04:23:14.400 --> 04:23:23.090
Orlando Sequera: change management. It also works hand in hand with continuous improvement and knowledge transfer activities at the Pmo level.

2513
04:23:23.460 --> 04:23:26.360
Orlando Sequera: and this is one of the 3 areas in which

2514
04:23:26.430 --> 04:23:31.150
Orlando Sequera: project management organizations can support value delivery.

2515
04:23:31.400 --> 04:23:45.980
Orlando Sequera: The other 2 are fostering delivery and outcomes, oriented capabilities, and also helping us to keep a big picture perspective. Remember what I mentioned before. We need to look at project managers at

2516
04:23:46.080 --> 04:23:48.710
Orlando Sequera: the big picture, not just

2517
04:23:48.910 --> 04:23:55.409
Orlando Sequera: not just what we have in front of us for for the next week or 2 weeks. No, we need to look at a bigger picture.

2518
04:23:55.980 --> 04:23:57.510
Orlando Sequera: The actual

2519
04:23:58.470 --> 04:24:04.380
Orlando Sequera: experts working in in our project team. They're the ones that are going to be dealing with a day daily tasks

2520
04:24:04.450 --> 04:24:20.089
Orlando Sequera: or daily activities. But we have to have that understanding of bigger picture. And, more importantly, we have to be able to communicate that bigger picture to the team, because sometimes this happens more often that not has happened to me multiple times.

2521
04:24:20.820 --> 04:24:22.060
Orlando Sequera: The members

2522
04:24:22.170 --> 04:24:40.229
Orlando Sequera: do not understand. Why are they working on a specific project? Why am I working on the software on this act software for the accounting department. This this is boring work. I don't see the point of why they already have one in place. Why do we have to work on this particular on this project, this, this is boring. This is not challenging.

2523
04:24:40.240 --> 04:24:50.450
Orlando Sequera: They might feel that way and guess what that's gonna have an impact on their productivity and their motivation. Who has access to that bigger picture to communicate to them.

2524
04:24:50.930 --> 04:24:58.770
Orlando Sequera: This is why we are working. We were assigned to work on this project. Your organization is willing to invest money and resources

2525
04:24:58.820 --> 04:25:01.659
Orlando Sequera: in this particular project, because

2526
04:25:02.010 --> 04:25:08.230
Orlando Sequera: it's align with organizational goals. We have access to that. We have to make sure that

2527
04:25:08.410 --> 04:25:12.159
Orlando Sequera: we convey that information to our projecting members.

2528
04:25:12.220 --> 04:25:12.869
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2529
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:19.249
Orlando Sequera: so that is a that is crucial, and we have to leverage a Pmo. To achieve that.

2530
04:25:20.500 --> 04:25:23.400
Orlando Sequera: How can we be successful when it comes to

2531
04:25:24.040 --> 04:25:25.250
Orlando Sequera: managing

2532
04:25:26.270 --> 04:25:28.540
Orlando Sequera: organizational change on?

2533
04:25:29.050 --> 04:25:31.590
Orlando Sequera: Imagine you're going to change your changes of

2534
04:25:31.620 --> 04:25:33.460
Orlando Sequera: impact on projects?

2535
04:25:33.700 --> 04:25:34.420
Orlando Sequera: So

2536
04:25:34.850 --> 04:25:36.119
Orlando Sequera: it starts by

2537
04:25:36.460 --> 04:25:38.959
Orlando Sequera: something that we have mentioned multiple times

2538
04:25:39.980 --> 04:25:52.860
Orlando Sequera: understanding the organizational culture. This is the ecosystem in which our projects are going to be conducted. As I mentioned before. If you're working for an organization that is.

2539
04:25:55.180 --> 04:25:57.500
Orlando Sequera: I give you, i'll give you an example

2540
04:25:57.540 --> 04:26:02.180
Orlando Sequera: for those of you that have had the chance to work with a Federal government here in the Us.

2541
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:08.650
Orlando Sequera: There is a particular way that things are done for government contractors right? So you need to understand

2542
04:26:08.730 --> 04:26:26.649
Orlando Sequera: how the or what are the power relationships with your organization, the key roles, the philosophy, the values. You need to understand that that's going to drive many of that's going to have a huge impact on the way Your projects are conducted, and sometimes they are not.

2543
04:26:26.660 --> 04:26:29.689
Orlando Sequera: In some cases those relationships are clear.

2544
04:26:29.940 --> 04:26:41.260
Orlando Sequera: It's easy for you to understand that they put in some other cases. They're not. You're working a working as a as a NASA contractor for multiple years.

2545
04:26:41.270 --> 04:26:58.170
Orlando Sequera: Some of those relationship between the customer and the the contractor. We're not. We're not really clear You were supporting multiple departments within the same or a customer organization in this case, NASA, the different reporting relationships. And

2546
04:26:58.590 --> 04:27:06.479
Orlando Sequera: do you need to understand and navigate that? To understand who your customer, I I guess the key question, you might be wondering, how do I do that

2547
04:27:06.530 --> 04:27:17.030
Orlando Sequera: understand? You might ask yourself who your customer is, who your real customer is? Who am I building this functionality for, and that's gonna help you to start understanding that.

2548
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:19.659
Orlando Sequera: And then the different relationships

2549
04:27:20.330 --> 04:27:21.720
Orlando Sequera: power relationships

2550
04:27:21.890 --> 04:27:35.440
Orlando Sequera: That's why we start. We're going to be talking about that it later. We need to understand at the very beginning of our project. Who are we to identify who our stakeholders are, who is going to be impacted by the project. Who can impact our project?

2551
04:27:35.570 --> 04:27:40.749
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand who those are and that needs to happen early in the project, so we can be successful.

2552
04:27:41.020 --> 04:27:48.750
Orlando Sequera: So we also need to evaluate the the impact of organizational change, To project and determine required actions.

2553
04:27:48.890 --> 04:27:56.129
Orlando Sequera: changes in that landscape of the organization. How they're going to impact the project. We also need to understand that

2554
04:27:56.940 --> 04:28:05.360
Orlando Sequera: we should be able to recommend possible options for changes in the project, and also this is an ongoing task

2555
04:28:05.420 --> 04:28:07.350
Orlando Sequera: of monitoring those

2556
04:28:07.600 --> 04:28:13.359
Orlando Sequera: enterprise environmental factors because they change. They change multiple times.

2557
04:28:13.400 --> 04:28:14.380
Orlando Sequera: this

2558
04:28:14.610 --> 04:28:19.490
Orlando Sequera: external and and the person or male factors. They're changing all the time a

2559
04:28:20.100 --> 04:28:21.529
Orlando Sequera: a quick example.

2560
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:30.709
Orlando Sequera: I I don't think that many organizations have under greater a global pandemic back in 2,018 or 20, even 20, nineteenth.

2561
04:28:30.820 --> 04:28:43.150
Orlando Sequera: So it was more of a close to Science Fiction a some in some cases not; but I don't think many organizations had that on the radar or the possible impacts at a global scale that that global pandemic were

2562
04:28:43.570 --> 04:28:59.540
Orlando Sequera: would have would have had, as we learned in the in in 2,020 right. So these are these factors are changing that we need to be. We. We need to constantly monitor their change, or it could be

2563
04:28:59.680 --> 04:29:09.529
Orlando Sequera: changes in new laws or existing laws are modified or changes in the marketplace. Maybe right now the type of resources that we need. They They are available.

2564
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:24.220
Orlando Sequera: Perhaps there's some changes in the industry, and that's no longer the case. So that's always changing that environment that ecosystem the projects that is always changing. And that's why we have to constantly monitor that environment.

2565
04:29:24.850 --> 04:29:27.970
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna take a look at the questions

2566
04:29:28.890 --> 04:29:30.939
Orlando Sequera: in the chat.

2567
04:29:31.620 --> 04:29:34.310
Orlando Sequera: I'm sorry not in the chat in the Q. And a.

2568
04:29:40.690 --> 04:29:43.979
Orlando Sequera: Okay. There's an earlier question about

2569
04:29:44.770 --> 04:29:48.409
Orlando Sequera: TV and Mpv: we know that we don't need to know those formulas.

2570
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:49.860
Orlando Sequera: We're not gonna

2571
04:29:49.940 --> 04:29:53.690
Orlando Sequera: go do any deeper dives on the Mpv. And Pv. Those are

2572
04:29:53.710 --> 04:29:55.939
Orlando Sequera: financial metrics that are used to select

2573
04:29:56.240 --> 04:29:59.140
Orlando Sequera: to select our projects by organizations.

2574
04:30:02.040 --> 04:30:03.850
Orlando Sequera: So

2575
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:14.180
Orlando Sequera: okay for content related questions in the chat.

2576
04:30:16.350 --> 04:30:18.529
Orlando Sequera: I'm: sorry in the Q. A.

2577
04:30:20.180 --> 04:30:24.770
Orlando Sequera: Are there numerical questions in the exam? Not many, if any, at all? Our

2578
04:30:24.840 --> 04:30:38.259
Orlando Sequera: questions are about interpretation, even when we, when we cover topics like earn value management. This particular version of the Pmp. Exam. Is more about interpretation of results, not about formula. So

2579
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:39.520
Orlando Sequera: No.

2580
04:30:39.570 --> 04:30:41.250
Orlando Sequera: that's

2581
04:30:41.620 --> 04:30:47.619
Orlando Sequera: that's a question that was in the chat. So the questions about it are about interpretation of results.

2582
04:30:52.080 --> 04:31:04.839
Orlando Sequera: There's another question that we need business case for analysts and by business, at least in that you approach. Yeah, that's about the justification that happens before the actual selection of the project.

2583
04:31:08.830 --> 04:31:10.800
Orlando Sequera: That's done.

2584
04:31:12.650 --> 04:31:14.510
Orlando Sequera: That's done

2585
04:31:20.730 --> 04:31:22.280
so. This question.

2586
04:31:24.330 --> 04:31:25.160
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2587
04:31:25.440 --> 04:31:26.530
Orlando Sequera: Our question

2588
04:31:26.620 --> 04:31:27.520
Orlando Sequera: about

2589
04:31:27.780 --> 04:31:29.780
Orlando Sequera: incremental versus iterative

2590
04:31:30.880 --> 04:31:35.399
Orlando Sequera: incremental means that we don't build all the functionality in

2591
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:38.399
Orlando Sequera: in one particular iteration or sprint.

2592
04:31:38.470 --> 04:31:53.020
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna be building increments. We're gonna start with this reports or this functionality first, and then in the next iteration, we're gonna add additional functionality and so on and so forth until we complete the entire function. That's how we do it in agile, okay.

2593
04:31:53.030 --> 04:32:04.400
Orlando Sequera: and iterative means that we do it multiple times in iterations. That comes from a Latin iterary. And that's what exactly what it means means multiple times.

2594
04:32:10.940 --> 04:32:12.199
I think. I ask.

2595
04:32:17.680 --> 04:32:19.260
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2596
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:23.119
Okay.

2597
04:32:29.060 --> 04:32:31.619
Orlando Sequera: okay, i'm looking for

2598
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:35.000
Orlando Sequera: any other questions. All right.

2599
04:32:41.300 --> 04:32:43.750
Orlando Sequera: There's some. There's a question in the Chat

2600
04:32:44.140 --> 04:32:50.050
Orlando Sequera: Ornando. You said that the Pmo. Will provide the best update for the organization's culture.

2601
04:32:50.530 --> 04:32:54.320
Orlando Sequera: What if your assessment of the organization that's not aligned with

2602
04:32:54.430 --> 04:32:56.549
Orlando Sequera: with that due to key players

2603
04:32:56.580 --> 04:32:58.530
Orlando Sequera: withholding information. Well.

2604
04:32:59.730 --> 04:33:01.609
Orlando Sequera: in that specific case.

2605
04:33:04.340 --> 04:33:06.099
Orlando Sequera: talk to other project managers.

2606
04:33:06.250 --> 04:33:16.169
Orlando Sequera: A talk to try to validate it. It really depends. If you're new to the organization talk, you gotta talk to people, talk to your sponsor. Your sponsor is vested in the project, and

2607
04:33:16.300 --> 04:33:24.359
Orlando Sequera: he or she, they want your project to be successful. So talk to people. That's the best answer to validate your

2608
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:28.149
Orlando Sequera: your assumptions and try to make sure

2609
04:33:28.169 --> 04:33:30.029
Orlando Sequera: that you understand the culture

2610
04:33:30.130 --> 04:33:34.279
Orlando Sequera: a well. And you understand those power relationships, etc. So

2611
04:33:34.770 --> 04:33:39.390
Orlando Sequera: talk to people network with people within the organization. That's the best answer for that.

2612
04:33:45.660 --> 04:33:46.720
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2613
04:33:48.070 --> 04:33:58.770
Orlando Sequera: there's another question in the chat. My laptop was frozen for a moment, and I missed your points on Pmo. The main take away from the Pmo. Aspect is leverage them. Use the Pmo. To

2614
04:33:59.540 --> 04:34:05.210
Orlando Sequera: understand the organization. Culture also as a source for artifacts and templates

2615
04:34:05.290 --> 04:34:06.280
Orlando Sequera: in

2616
04:34:06.630 --> 04:34:07.750
Orlando Sequera: all day

2617
04:34:07.919 --> 04:34:16.770
Orlando Sequera: documentation that you need to have in place for your project sources templates for for that documentation that is required. You leverage the pmo

2618
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:24.090
Orlando Sequera: leverage, the Pmo. If you have one in in place in your organization. So that was the the the main, the main point

2619
04:34:24.650 --> 04:34:25.539
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2620
04:34:29.220 --> 04:34:33.910
Orlando Sequera: That's it for the chat. Thank you for keeping it under control.

2621
04:34:34.770 --> 04:34:35.430
Orlando Sequera: A.

2622
04:34:35.599 --> 04:34:40.840
Orlando Sequera: And I'm. Trying to look for other questions in the Q. A. They need to be answered.

2623
04:34:42.080 --> 04:34:44.650
Orlando Sequera: Content related questions. That is.

2624
04:34:51.880 --> 04:35:02.019
Orlando Sequera: It's a question about metrics selecting projects. Is there? Is there ever a time which a project is selected? Has a lower plan value than the other than the other.

2625
04:35:02.529 --> 04:35:03.430
Orlando Sequera: A.

2626
04:35:04.060 --> 04:35:12.370
Orlando Sequera: That happens in real life. Yes, but for the exam, remember, the main takeaway is to understand that those financial metrics are used to

2627
04:35:13.320 --> 04:35:31.519
Orlando Sequera: those. Those are the financial metrics used to select projects by organizations so usually for those person purpose. It's going to be. They they once they have they hire a Pv. The higher Mpv. Shorter a or shortest, the payback period, etc. Those are the ones that are going to be selected.

2628
04:35:34.400 --> 04:35:35.230
So

2629
04:35:37.700 --> 04:35:39.040
Orlando Sequera: that's done.

2630
04:35:39.730 --> 04:35:41.700
I explain

2631
04:35:42.080 --> 04:35:44.819
Orlando Sequera: the difference between incremental and iterative.

2632
04:35:45.800 --> 04:35:53.170
Orlando Sequera: How often did you suggest? We reviewed some content outline. Well as we cover the content, and then you can review.

2633
04:35:53.970 --> 04:35:58.020
Orlando Sequera: you can review it again at the end of the class to find out your

2634
04:35:58.060 --> 04:36:02.789
Orlando Sequera: You can perform a sort analysis. You should understand your

2635
04:36:04.349 --> 04:36:10.769
Orlando Sequera: you should understand your weaknesses and your strengths, which areas you need to work on a little bit more so

2636
04:36:10.950 --> 04:36:19.039
Orlando Sequera: at the end of the class, and as we cover this topics. That's a recommendation. But that's what you're going to be tested on. Bmi is

2637
04:36:19.279 --> 04:36:31.359
Orlando Sequera: looking for a. With the Pmp. Exam what they really testing you on is how well can you solve problems? The the exam is about solving problems

2638
04:36:31.439 --> 04:36:33.050
Orlando Sequera: using those

2639
04:36:33.730 --> 04:36:41.519
Orlando Sequera: tools and techniques that we're covering throughout the class. The application of these tools and techniques is about problem solving. That's what the exam is all about.

2640
04:36:41.720 --> 04:36:48.349
Orlando Sequera: and that requires a experience that requires also exposure to this to this company?

2641
04:36:55.320 --> 04:36:56.460
Orlando Sequera: Right?

2642
04:37:03.560 --> 04:37:05.030
Orlando Sequera: Yes. And

2643
04:37:05.529 --> 04:37:11.389
Orlando Sequera: remember, if you really want to know, what type of questions am I going to be facing? You Have test prep in persecution.

2644
04:37:11.849 --> 04:37:18.520
Orlando Sequera: Those are that is your sandbox. So you can take practice questions, and it's gonna get you.

2645
04:37:19.150 --> 04:37:25.350
Orlando Sequera: That's gonna get you ready for the Pmp. Exam. There's another question in the chat. Please change your blue box to

2646
04:37:25.460 --> 04:37:37.880
Orlando Sequera: everyone, so everyone can see your question. Our today's topic part of Pmp: Exam: Absolutely. Yes, that's a Yes, we capital, Yes, everything that we're covering in the class is related to your Pmp: Exam.

2647
04:37:38.910 --> 04:37:39.510
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2648
04:37:42.910 --> 04:37:45.629
Orlando Sequera: How can we get to know those

2649
04:37:46.939 --> 04:37:49.370
Orlando Sequera: organizational cultures and styles.

2650
04:37:49.960 --> 04:37:52.579
Orlando Sequera: This is about the view of leadership.

2651
04:37:52.880 --> 04:38:16.410
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand that view of leadership. That's what I was mentioning before about those power relationships right. It's leadership, hierarchy, and authority. We to understand that that changes from an organization to organization. That's it. That is one key aspect of the organization culture. It takes time. The larger the organization, the more complex this is going to be. It takes time

2652
04:38:16.419 --> 04:38:20.080
Orlando Sequera: to understand a. To understand that. Okay.

2653
04:38:20.119 --> 04:38:21.940
Orlando Sequera: then it's about

2654
04:38:22.810 --> 04:38:27.049
Orlando Sequera: understanding theervation, the leaves, and the expectations that you have

2655
04:38:27.110 --> 04:38:28.010
Orlando Sequera: for

2656
04:38:28.610 --> 04:38:30.460
Orlando Sequera: your for the

2657
04:38:30.550 --> 04:38:49.330
Orlando Sequera: not that you have that the organization has in place. You need to understand that where they're going, what are the values where they relieve? That's what we mean by our organizational culture it is. It's important to understand that. And that in this culture is going to dictate the hierarchy and the type of leadership

2658
04:38:49.570 --> 04:38:50.640
Orlando Sequera: that is

2659
04:38:50.779 --> 04:38:56.920
Orlando Sequera: going to exist in the organization, and also the power relationships of

2660
04:38:57.040 --> 04:39:12.769
Orlando Sequera: all there a other type of of of of the different departments of the organization that's super important. That's part of the Intel that you have to work on to make sure that you are going to understand it, that you need to understand

2661
04:39:12.779 --> 04:39:32.429
Orlando Sequera: in order to be successful. This is gonna dictate how projects are gonna be done. This is why this is so important, the code of contact they operate in the operating environment. What is the actual motivation and reward system that is in place for the company, and that it is.

2662
04:39:32.439 --> 04:39:35.109
Orlando Sequera: it is really important, the Us. Upm.

2663
04:39:35.210 --> 04:39:47.310
Orlando Sequera: that you have a solid knowledge as quickly as possible, especially if you're new to your organization, You're gonna. This is part of your sync or swim. This is one of the initial tasks that you have to work on to make sure that you understand that landscape

2664
04:39:47.490 --> 04:39:50.579
Orlando Sequera: as as thoroughly as possible

2665
04:39:51.010 --> 04:40:08.499
Orlando Sequera: and as quickly as possible, because it's gonna dictate. It's gonna help you in increasing the chances of being successful with your projects. This is one of the key aspects, and I've been mentioning this a lot. This is going to be in your exam. This is important to understand. For the exam.

2666
04:40:09.390 --> 04:40:25.559
Orlando Sequera: Okay, a a quick example of this organizational culture will be a company that allows their employees or team members to work flexible hours compared to another type of organization that is strictly 8 to 5

2667
04:40:25.680 --> 04:40:28.030
Orlando Sequera: work days

2668
04:40:28.130 --> 04:40:31.860
Orlando Sequera: at the office. No exceptions allowed

2669
04:40:31.880 --> 04:40:32.770
Orlando Sequera: that

2670
04:40:32.880 --> 04:40:42.360
Orlando Sequera: it's gonna have an impact in the way that you scheduled your project activities. And it's also gonna have an impact on team morale and how the team conducts their interactions

2671
04:40:42.390 --> 04:41:00.900
Orlando Sequera: Right? So you, you, you don't have any control over the approach of the come. Some companies allow a a hybrid approach that they have hours of the office, and then they can work remotely as well. Some of them are. That's that's a known of everybody's coming back to the workplace, etc. So you need to understand that

2672
04:41:00.910 --> 04:41:14.070
Orlando Sequera: because it's gonna have an impact on the way you scheduled your productivity. It's gonna have an impact on the way those relationships within the team a occur. So you need to know that for your

2673
04:41:14.290 --> 04:41:15.460
Orlando Sequera: for your

2674
04:41:16.570 --> 04:41:17.500
Orlando Sequera: projects.

2675
04:41:17.800 --> 04:41:19.300
Orlando Sequera: in order to be successful.

2676
04:41:23.310 --> 04:41:27.930
Orlando Sequera: I see some of you that have started to take the

2677
04:41:28.270 --> 04:41:33.830
Orlando Sequera: So you start using a test prep. Do you do not need to go outside of

2678
04:41:34.210 --> 04:41:36.390
Orlando Sequera: this resources. It's up to you.

2679
04:41:36.450 --> 04:41:41.789
Orlando Sequera: There are some resources outside of what we offer, but with what what we have is

2680
04:41:42.090 --> 04:41:46.399
Orlando Sequera: it's enough for you to get to get ready for the Pmp: Exam.

2681
04:41:47.430 --> 04:41:48.170
Okay.

2682
04:41:49.140 --> 04:41:50.360
Orlando Sequera: A:

2683
04:41:53.900 --> 04:41:58.999
Orlando Sequera: All right. There's a practice section in Precipio. That's where your test prep is going to be at

2684
04:41:59.850 --> 04:42:00.740
Orlando Sequera: all right

2685
04:42:03.500 --> 04:42:09.870
Orlando Sequera: when it comes. Another aspect that we have to really understand about our organizations.

2686
04:42:11.140 --> 04:42:14.010
Orlando Sequera: It's about their take on risk.

2687
04:42:15.150 --> 04:42:19.499
Orlando Sequera: of course, the culture that we mentioned, and they're taken change.

2688
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:20.610
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2689
04:42:20.930 --> 04:42:23.480
Orlando Sequera: this is we. These aspects are

2690
04:42:23.660 --> 04:42:33.400
Orlando Sequera: closely related at the organizational level, and this is part of that initial intel work that you have to perform. As I mentioned. You need to understand that really well.

2691
04:42:33.520 --> 04:42:36.390
Orlando Sequera: because that you need to understand the risk tolerance.

2692
04:42:36.790 --> 04:42:56.710
Orlando Sequera: If and also the rest of your individual stakeholders, will talk about risk that that's a specific section of the content. But you need to understand that. What are they? The the the views that they have about risk. That's gonna change, and and also it changes from region to region.

2693
04:42:56.780 --> 04:43:02.660
Orlando Sequera: It changes from an organization to organization. It changes from country to country. It changes from industry to industry

2694
04:43:02.790 --> 04:43:11.600
Orlando Sequera: it the type of leadership that we have, or and of course he has an impact on the project team and another aspect that

2695
04:43:11.740 --> 04:43:30.750
Orlando Sequera: he's becoming more and more and more prevalent. And this class an example of that is diversity. We're going to be working with people. Chances are in most cases, I would say, I will venture to say that. And in most cases that we're going to be working with teams that are very diverse with people in multiple geographic locations, and we have to.

2696
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:44.829
Orlando Sequera: We have to. Also. That's another in the price of a real factor. That's that's that we get to keep in mind that the culture of our specific location might be. Is it going to be different from a.

2697
04:43:45.180 --> 04:43:54.899
Orlando Sequera: The the culture of all of their other team members that we're working with, and that's something that we have to take in. We have to. We have to factor that in.

2698
04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:58.420
Orlando Sequera: and it boils down to

2699
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:59.380
Orlando Sequera: some.

2700
04:43:59.970 --> 04:44:08.669
Orlando Sequera: We we're gonna go over those those values that we have to follow. It's about respect. It's about understanding and the in using diversity as

2701
04:44:09.340 --> 04:44:17.229
Orlando Sequera: as a plus or not as a minus, because that can help us to have a a more enhanced a view and approach

2702
04:44:17.320 --> 04:44:30.129
Orlando Sequera: because we have the people that look at things differently. And we that that's gonna help us. They might be looking at things that we are not considering. So that's a that's an actual strength. It's not. It's not a weakness. Okay?

2703
04:44:30.190 --> 04:44:39.609
Orlando Sequera: A: so that is important. We we're talking about at the organizational level. We need to understand that as part of your intel work as a project manager, and

2704
04:44:40.300 --> 04:44:43.300
Orlando Sequera: because this is going to help us to understand

2705
04:44:44.570 --> 04:44:48.259
Orlando Sequera: A. To come up with the right approaches, to start

2706
04:44:48.500 --> 04:44:49.730
Orlando Sequera: our projects

2707
04:44:50.010 --> 04:45:07.399
Orlando Sequera: with the best, the best way possible, and also to start planning our projects the best way possible. And it's also going to help us to understand what our, what do we need to get the job done in a more efficient way? So really has a major a

2708
04:45:07.720 --> 04:45:21.550
Orlando Sequera: a major impact? Yeah, I see some of you mentioned in the values. Yes, being professional, right, respect is crucial, and then everything is built around respect. But yeah, there are multiple values, and that changes from organization to organization. But yeah respect it's a universal value

2709
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:23.690
Orlando Sequera: that that is going to help you to understand

2710
04:45:23.730 --> 04:45:24.600
that that

2711
04:45:24.820 --> 04:45:25.530
Orlando Sequera: right?

2712
04:45:25.710 --> 04:45:31.620
Orlando Sequera: So really, really really important that we understand this. And, as I said before, easier set than done.

2713
04:45:31.810 --> 04:45:35.190
Orlando Sequera: This is something that you're not gonna be learning

2714
04:45:35.330 --> 04:45:36.390
Orlando Sequera: in

2715
04:45:36.710 --> 04:45:39.470
Orlando Sequera: a when you are a

2716
04:45:39.970 --> 04:45:48.209
Orlando Sequera: When you're new to an organization. This is not part of their onboarding process. This is not written in a document. It's something that you have to figure out

2717
04:45:48.300 --> 04:45:57.780
Orlando Sequera: you. You You can rely on the Pmo. But you're gonna have to talk to people, talk to you, talk to other project managers that have more experience. Talk to a.

2718
04:45:57.940 --> 04:46:01.760
Orlando Sequera: To the Pmo. Officers that might be in place.

2719
04:46:01.930 --> 04:46:09.149
Orlando Sequera: Talk to your product, Sponsor. If you are assigned to a project right away. When you're new to the organization you have to

2720
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:23.569
Orlando Sequera: do, you have to be proactive. That is key. That is a crucial aspect of being a successful project manager. We have to be proactive. We have to jump on things. No, they're not going to be given to us. We have to get the information. That's what we do. That's

2721
04:46:23.720 --> 04:46:31.860
Orlando Sequera: That's how we can be successful. So being proactive. Okay, we to understand the quicker we understand this, the organizational culture, the power relationships.

2722
04:46:31.880 --> 04:46:34.689
Orlando Sequera: the risk, tolerance, risk, approach.

2723
04:46:34.880 --> 04:46:45.490
Orlando Sequera: and the way change is embrace into your organization. By doing that we're going to be increasing the chances of exponentially. The chances of our projects to be successful.

2724
04:46:45.730 --> 04:46:48.379
Orlando Sequera: Right? So a lot of

2725
04:46:48.490 --> 04:46:58.679
Orlando Sequera: on written information this is, try more of a more tribal knowledge, more information that is comes with experience. But you need to

2726
04:46:58.760 --> 04:47:00.609
Orlando Sequera: a quickly get

2727
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:04.139
Orlando Sequera: get up to speed when it comes to the

2728
04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:06.050
Orlando Sequera: organization of culture.

2729
04:47:06.160 --> 04:47:07.570
Orlando Sequera: risk, approach.

2730
04:47:07.660 --> 04:47:11.309
Orlando Sequera: and the way change is embraced in the organization. Super important.

2731
04:47:13.690 --> 04:47:15.649
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2732
04:47:15.940 --> 04:47:17.800
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

2733
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:20.130
Orlando Sequera: the Change management framework.

2734
04:47:21.660 --> 04:47:25.550
Orlando Sequera: any organizational change. That is a true statement. This

2735
04:47:25.570 --> 04:47:27.530
Orlando Sequera: is going to require

2736
04:47:27.950 --> 04:47:32.880
Orlando Sequera: individual change. It starts with the individual. This is just a framework.

2737
04:47:32.950 --> 04:47:34.660
Orlando Sequera: A. The At car

2738
04:47:34.870 --> 04:47:39.620
Orlando Sequera: framework that allows you. It's. It's basically a model that creates

2739
04:47:39.940 --> 04:47:43.009
Orlando Sequera: an internal language for individual change.

2740
04:47:43.890 --> 04:47:44.890
Orlando Sequera: and gives

2741
04:47:45.610 --> 04:47:53.210
Orlando Sequera: upper management the leaders of the organization a framework for helping people in their organization to embrace

2742
04:47:53.240 --> 04:47:55.979
Orlando Sequera: changes, to embrace a more importantly

2743
04:47:56.360 --> 04:47:59.230
Orlando Sequera: to adopt those changes, because this

2744
04:47:59.500 --> 04:48:07.290
Orlando Sequera: easier set than done. There's a lot of in in many cases where it's it's part of human nature.

2745
04:48:07.470 --> 04:48:13.309
Orlando Sequera: We we're, we're going to be. We're resistant to changes in some cases. So organizations

2746
04:48:13.420 --> 04:48:14.810
Orlando Sequera: try to follow

2747
04:48:15.080 --> 04:48:21.719
Orlando Sequera: more systematic systematic approaches, to facilitate that change to come to first.

2748
04:48:21.840 --> 04:48:30.490
Orlando Sequera: and following this model. The atcar model is one way of doing that. It's not the only one, but it's one way of doing that. The a. Stands for awareness.

2749
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:35.980
Orlando Sequera: Why do we need this change? That's the awareness portion, then the desire

2750
04:48:36.630 --> 04:48:41.180
Orlando Sequera: to support the change. That's what the d stands for. The K.

2751
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:42.290
Orlando Sequera: Is.

2752
04:48:42.750 --> 04:48:45.150
Orlando Sequera: it comes from knowledge

2753
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:47.260
Orlando Sequera: of how to change.

2754
04:48:47.850 --> 04:48:52.220
Orlando Sequera: and then the a. Stands for the ability to demonstrate the new skills and behaviors.

2755
04:48:52.330 --> 04:49:00.759
Orlando Sequera: and they, and last, but not least, reinforcement. Right? That's what the our stands for. So so do you want? Do you want to reinforce

2756
04:49:00.790 --> 04:49:05.309
Orlando Sequera: these changes? So they become permanent over time, and it's not a

2757
04:49:05.640 --> 04:49:09.380
Orlando Sequera: a one-time deal. Okay, that's really really really important.

2758
04:49:14.220 --> 04:49:16.859
Orlando Sequera: Let me take a look at the questions.

2759
04:49:25.580 --> 04:49:26.420
Okay.

2760
04:49:28.990 --> 04:49:31.359
Orlando Sequera: or some questions from before.

2761
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:34.950
Orlando Sequera: Will it be beneficial to to

2762
04:49:35.050 --> 04:49:38.719
Orlando Sequera: proceed at a deeper level for the exam?

2763
04:49:40.090 --> 04:49:44.689
Orlando Sequera: Do you have enough with this content? Not not. I'm gonna say No.

2764
04:49:44.910 --> 04:49:53.690
Orlando Sequera: that's a question in the Q. A. Would it be beneficial to to it? Proceed at a deeper level for the exam. I'm. Going to say a. I'm going to say no sure answer for that.

2765
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:56.260
Orlando Sequera: Do you have enough

2766
04:49:56.320 --> 04:49:59.570
Orlando Sequera: with your with the content that we're going over?

2767
04:50:00.780 --> 04:50:04.030
Orlando Sequera: It is a curse, something that will have

2768
04:50:04.090 --> 04:50:05.590
Orlando Sequera: scenario questions.

2769
04:50:07.660 --> 04:50:12.470
Orlando Sequera: Not necessarily. But you need to understand. This is just a framework for change.

2770
04:50:16.560 --> 04:50:19.659
Orlando Sequera: so that'll be my answer to that question.

2771
04:50:27.870 --> 04:50:39.469
Orlando Sequera: And again for you to get a better idea. These definitions are not going to be clearly specified in the questions. Go to test, prep and see how those questions are phrased.

2772
04:50:42.950 --> 04:50:46.789
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So when when you take practice questions that's going to answer.

2773
04:50:46.890 --> 04:50:48.680
Orlando Sequera: that's going to help you

2774
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:50.400
Orlando Sequera: with

2775
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.960
Orlando Sequera: with that.

2776
04:50:53.500 --> 04:50:59.810
Orlando Sequera: do we need to remember these acronyms for the exam. Well, there are 2 that I would say, some of them. Yes.

2777
04:51:00.160 --> 04:51:01.810
Orlando Sequera: that's a question in the Q. And a.

2778
04:51:02.120 --> 04:51:03.699
Orlando Sequera: Some of them yes.

2779
04:51:03.770 --> 04:51:05.240
Orlando Sequera: like Eef

2780
04:51:05.370 --> 04:51:12.220
Orlando Sequera: and opa, and i'll be doing my best in highlighting the ones that you need to remember for the exam.

2781
04:51:13.460 --> 04:51:14.310
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

2782
04:51:21.150 --> 04:51:22.830
Orlando Sequera: Oh.

2783
04:51:31.710 --> 04:51:34.590
Orlando Sequera: some of the recent questions

2784
04:51:42.370 --> 04:51:55.100
Orlando Sequera: from before was different. Between that a module center of excellence and a Pmo. Will. Pmo. I think we cover. It supports project management activities and a magical center of excellence. It promotes agile, best practices.

2785
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:04.699
Orlando Sequera: sure examples of portfolio I mentioned. We did that

2786
04:52:14.620 --> 04:52:16.540
Orlando Sequera: i'm. Going over the Q. A.

2787
04:52:31.060 --> 04:52:38.350
Orlando Sequera: So another question about press and value, and I present value again. What you need to know for the exam is that they are just.

2788
04:52:38.780 --> 04:52:40.440
Orlando Sequera: They are just

2789
04:52:41.410 --> 04:52:47.169
Orlando Sequera: metrics that are used in project selection, criteria. They hire Mpv. And Pv.

2790
04:52:47.320 --> 04:52:49.040
Orlando Sequera: The breaks. I have the higher

2791
04:52:49.100 --> 04:52:59.610
Orlando Sequera: net person, value person value, or most likely gonna be selected. That's what we need to know for the Pmp. Exam: it's not an accounting exam. It's not a finance exam. It is a project management. Exam.

2792
04:53:00.240 --> 04:53:00.960
Okay.

2793
04:53:24.190 --> 04:53:26.450
Orlando Sequera: There is a question about.

2794
04:53:26.520 --> 04:53:30.510
Orlando Sequera: Okay, Can you elaborate on risk tolerance? Absolutely

2795
04:53:31.580 --> 04:53:34.329
Orlando Sequera: depending on the industry? I'm going to give you a quick example.

2796
04:53:35.370 --> 04:53:36.420
Orlando Sequera: Aerospace.

2797
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:42.510
Orlando Sequera: Human lives are at risk when it comes to

2798
04:53:42.780 --> 04:53:48.820
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to aerospace, when NASA is the best example, and they have learned that by

2799
04:53:50.000 --> 04:53:54.910
Orlando Sequera: a learning over over the years, they let's go back to the Apollo program.

2800
04:53:55.610 --> 04:54:04.119
Orlando Sequera: a polo one. They had a major accident before they could even launch a rocket, and unfortunately human lives were lost. And then with

2801
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:07.090
Orlando Sequera: another program with the shuttle program.

2802
04:54:07.250 --> 04:54:20.719
Orlando Sequera: We had 2 accidents, one going up in 1,986 with a challenger. I'm sorry with the this is the challenge. I always get. Get them confused. I think it was a challenger. Yes. And then coming back with Columbia.

2803
04:54:22.080 --> 04:54:22.700
Orlando Sequera: it

2804
04:54:22.970 --> 04:54:25.220
Orlando Sequera: sen in 2,003.

2805
04:54:25.330 --> 04:54:26.170
Orlando Sequera: So

2806
04:54:26.860 --> 04:54:31.330
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to risk tolerance, NASA is risk adverse

2807
04:54:32.040 --> 04:54:35.320
Orlando Sequera: Anything that is related to what they do

2808
04:54:36.330 --> 04:54:40.570
Orlando Sequera: is a safety. First, it's a control environment.

2809
04:54:41.020 --> 04:54:47.049
Orlando Sequera: they are risk. Averse risk has to be mitigated by the way. Risk. Elimination does not exist.

2810
04:54:47.180 --> 04:54:49.220
Orlando Sequera: so their level of

2811
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:54.420
Orlando Sequera: the level of threshold when it comes to risk, for NASA is very low.

2812
04:54:54.880 --> 04:54:58.039
Orlando Sequera: so it depends on in their in their space industry.

2813
04:54:58.120 --> 04:54:58.910
Orlando Sequera: But

2814
04:54:59.120 --> 04:55:00.610
Orlando Sequera: all their industries

2815
04:55:01.050 --> 04:55:06.880
Orlando Sequera: depending on what they're doing. They might have a higher

2816
04:55:07.060 --> 04:55:08.130
Orlando Sequera: 3 a

2817
04:55:08.430 --> 04:55:23.820
Orlando Sequera: risk tolerance if they're trying to sell a new product. For if it's a messaging application like Whatsapp or a any of these platforms in social media, they are risk the risk. The risk. Tolerance is higher, right.

2818
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:29.400
Orlando Sequera: so they are willing to. They're more aggressive when it comes to that, so their approach to risk

2819
04:55:29.460 --> 04:55:33.159
Orlando Sequera: it depends on the industry. It depends on the organization depends on the values.

2820
04:55:33.170 --> 04:55:52.679
Orlando Sequera: But we need to understand that. So because that's gonna have an impact on the way, we have to manage our projects so that' that's what we mean by a restart, and we're gonna explain that again when we cover risk. That's an important area of frozen mansion. We're gonna have the chance to go over over risk in detail.

2821
04:55:52.690 --> 04:55:53.350
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2822
04:55:53.700 --> 04:55:54.920
Orlando Sequera: So good question.

2823
04:56:04.960 --> 04:56:07.770
Orlando Sequera: I'm reviewing the chat as well.

2824
04:56:21.550 --> 04:56:31.949
Orlando Sequera: Can we get the recordings? Yes, we said that at the beginning the please change to your blue box to everyone. So everyone can see your question. Can you get the recording? Absolutely? We said that for study purposes absolutely

2825
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:34.130
Orlando Sequera: is

2826
04:56:35.620 --> 04:56:48.050
Orlando Sequera: a I do not see the test prep. In resources in Precipio. It is under practice, not under resources. My apologies, probably. I I said that it was on the reasons No, it's in precipit, but it's under practice.

2827
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:53.250
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2828
04:56:57.850 --> 04:57:04.970
Orlando Sequera: And I see a comment here about a risk mitigation, strategy in a space. Yes, but for risk we're going.

2829
04:57:05.330 --> 04:57:09.349
Orlando Sequera: Pmi is very specific on what they use. And we're gonna stick to those

2830
04:57:09.420 --> 04:57:12.819
Orlando Sequera: a definition because risk management is.

2831
04:57:13.210 --> 04:57:14.220
Orlando Sequera: It's a.

2832
04:57:14.630 --> 04:57:21.310
Orlando Sequera: Has multiple applications in multiple industries. For example, risk in the financial industry is different from

2833
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:30.220
Orlando Sequera: project management risk. Right? So we're going to. We're going to limit to constrain the scope to what is needed. What is used for

2834
04:57:30.480 --> 04:57:42.799
Orlando Sequera: project management for the Pmp. Exempt Cable risk is a vast area and has multiple applications and approaches. But we're going to follow the ones that are needed for the Pmp: Accept.

2835
04:57:45.440 --> 04:57:46.050
right?

2836
04:57:48.560 --> 04:57:55.119
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So we are ready for our next break. We're going to take a 10 min break. We'll be back

2837
04:57:55.660 --> 04:57:59.000
Orlando Sequera: in 10 min. Enjoy your break.

2838
04:57:59.440 --> 04:58:01.740
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to continue shortly.

2839
05:02:15.860 --> 05:02:20.360
Orlando Sequera: All right, Hopefully you enjoyed your break. We are back

2840
05:02:22.410 --> 05:02:23.740
Orlando Sequera: and

2841
05:02:26.000 --> 05:02:28.850
Orlando Sequera: trying to answer some of the questions

2842
05:02:29.780 --> 05:02:30.650
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2843
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:38.600
Orlando Sequera: and thank you for your collaboration.

2844
05:02:38.820 --> 05:02:41.469
Orlando Sequera: So we are going to

2845
05:02:42.270 --> 05:02:43.580
Orlando Sequera: a

2846
05:02:43.630 --> 05:02:49.830
Orlando Sequera: go over again about the attendance. There's some important important information in the chat.

2847
05:02:50.930 --> 05:02:52.450
Orlando Sequera: Everyone.

2848
05:02:52.610 --> 05:02:58.709
Orlando Sequera: as we have said before, everyone should be tracking their time in the attendance tracker.

2849
05:03:00.380 --> 05:03:03.909
Orlando Sequera: This is going to be needed. The attendance tracker is going to be need

2850
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:05.310
Orlando Sequera: when

2851
05:03:05.540 --> 05:03:11.199
Orlando Sequera: using the certificate request process, so you can get your certificate of completion.

2852
05:03:12.240 --> 05:03:14.210
Orlando Sequera: If, for some reason

2853
05:03:14.290 --> 05:03:16.620
Orlando Sequera: your attendance is not perfect.

2854
05:03:16.800 --> 05:03:21.659
Orlando Sequera: and you can get your certificate, using your self serve option.

2855
05:03:21.720 --> 05:03:22.710
Orlando Sequera: which is

2856
05:03:23.050 --> 05:03:28.200
Orlando Sequera: only available to perip your users. Then you are going to need

2857
05:03:29.480 --> 05:03:35.319
Orlando Sequera: to use the certificate request process to get your certificate of completion.

2858
05:03:36.080 --> 05:03:41.780
Orlando Sequera: Per CPU users should always check the self-serve option first

2859
05:03:41.890 --> 05:03:46.929
Orlando Sequera: before using the certificate request option that's Why.

2860
05:03:47.140 --> 05:03:47.990
Orlando Sequera: this

2861
05:03:48.360 --> 05:03:52.779
Orlando Sequera: certainly your attendance tracker is so important. Okay.

2862
05:03:53.080 --> 05:03:55.650
Orlando Sequera: And by checking that means

2863
05:03:55.700 --> 05:03:56.810
Orlando Sequera: we mean.

2864
05:03:56.850 --> 05:03:59.579
Orlando Sequera: after the last session has in

2865
05:03:59.630 --> 05:04:17.009
Orlando Sequera: Okay, important, important, important. If you're a per super user you should try to always use a self-serf option to get your certificate of completion. If you are not, then you should use the certificate request option, but in both instances you have to fill out your

2866
05:04:17.790 --> 05:04:23.910
Orlando Sequera: attendance tracker. It is important. Okay, it is. It is extremely important.

2867
05:04:24.030 --> 05:04:25.840
Orlando Sequera: Right? Track Your time

2868
05:04:26.140 --> 05:04:27.110
Orlando Sequera: and

2869
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:33.470
Orlando Sequera: the instructions are part of the document. So let's let's go ahead and read the document All right.

2870
05:04:34.370 --> 05:04:36.909
Orlando Sequera: right it. So that was a public service announcement.

2871
05:04:38.490 --> 05:04:40.640
Orlando Sequera: and we have it in place.

2872
05:04:40.980 --> 05:04:42.880
Orlando Sequera: basically Asa.

2873
05:04:43.410 --> 05:04:49.570
Orlando Sequera: as of redundancy just in just for as a backup for for percip users. But

2874
05:04:49.600 --> 05:04:58.689
Orlando Sequera: but we it's, and it's always a it is a MOS for non persecuted users. So again, going back about the certificate of completion

2875
05:04:58.900 --> 05:05:09.629
Orlando Sequera: if you are a precipitation, you go to self-serf use that option first to get your certificate request, and you're going to do that at the end of the class, but you have to keep your

2876
05:05:09.870 --> 05:05:12.490
Orlando Sequera: track, track. Your attendance on a daily basis.

2877
05:05:12.570 --> 05:05:16.480
Orlando Sequera: Okay, if you're a a nonprofit user, then you use

2878
05:05:16.730 --> 05:05:17.660
Orlando Sequera: your

2879
05:05:17.790 --> 05:05:19.910
Orlando Sequera: certificate request option.

2880
05:05:20.160 --> 05:05:20.750
Okay.

2881
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:23.589
Orlando Sequera: So please make sure that you follow that.

2882
05:05:24.380 --> 05:05:28.950
Orlando Sequera: All right, let's continue with your with the content.

2883
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:37.219
Orlando Sequera: What are the actions that we can complete to support, change.

2884
05:05:37.940 --> 05:05:40.489
Orlando Sequera: And, by the way, here

2885
05:05:41.440 --> 05:05:43.060
Orlando Sequera: these actions.

2886
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:45.929
Orlando Sequera: these are those and Don't that

2887
05:05:46.510 --> 05:05:52.950
Orlando Sequera: the organization, and in many cases we can implement this approach for our specific projects as project managers.

2888
05:05:54.370 --> 05:05:58.830
Orlando Sequera: Some of the do that are really important. We have to

2889
05:05:59.980 --> 05:06:07.260
Orlando Sequera: part of what we have to do. We, as as servant leaders, that's a that's a concept that is gonna come to the forefront. We're gonna go over that

2890
05:06:07.660 --> 05:06:12.600
Orlando Sequera: later. In the class port. We lead people. We lead our

2891
05:06:13.140 --> 05:06:14.570
Orlando Sequera: project team members

2892
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:21.050
Orlando Sequera: lead them to what? To success, to being successful with our project with our projects. Okay, so

2893
05:06:21.330 --> 05:06:26.590
Orlando Sequera: we are going to be doing a lot of coaching and part of that coaching is

2894
05:06:27.220 --> 05:06:35.190
Orlando Sequera: coaching our co-workers to support our business. Going back to the example that I used a few minutes ago with the

2895
05:06:35.210 --> 05:06:37.470
Orlando Sequera: software for the accounting department.

2896
05:06:37.940 --> 05:06:38.900
Orlando Sequera: They

2897
05:06:39.170 --> 05:06:41.570
Orlando Sequera: No. Some of your team members.

2898
05:06:41.920 --> 05:06:43.499
Orlando Sequera: and I have been in that.

2899
05:06:43.800 --> 05:06:45.050
Orlando Sequera: It's a true statement.

2900
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:50.629
Orlando Sequera: They might think that what they're doing is not really challenging. It's not a

2901
05:06:50.730 --> 05:06:54.099
Orlando Sequera: I I it's not cool just for lack of a better word.

2902
05:06:54.340 --> 05:06:55.450
Orlando Sequera: is not?

2903
05:06:55.770 --> 05:07:12.419
Orlando Sequera: It's not fancy enough, or it's not challenging enough. Why am I working on this report that is boring, and you might have those one. By working on this they might question the work that is being done. So you always have to

2904
05:07:12.600 --> 05:07:23.540
Orlando Sequera: coach them and remind them that there's a reason why the organization is investing money and time and resources on that specific project, because it is tied up to.

2905
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:39.749
Orlando Sequera: That's strategic goal of improving the efficiency of the accounting department and finance by 20% in the next fiscal year. That's why the organisations do that this is important work that the organization wants to

2906
05:07:39.810 --> 05:07:41.180
Orlando Sequera: a complete

2907
05:07:41.420 --> 05:07:46.580
Orlando Sequera: for the next fiscal year. That's how we can support this for this organization, too.

2908
05:07:46.980 --> 05:07:53.599
Orlando Sequera: to to be more efficient and to remain in business. So it's about providing that coaching aspect.

2909
05:07:53.650 --> 05:08:10.420
Orlando Sequera: In many cases they don't they do not have access to that bigger picture we do. We have to convey that information to our project team members, and it's about passion. Remember that we are leading them. We're not directing them. They're not. They don't report to us. We're no use in authority. We're using

2910
05:08:11.280 --> 05:08:12.290
Orlando Sequera: leadership.

2911
05:08:12.400 --> 05:08:15.840
Orlando Sequera: We're using coaching. We're using server leadership.

2912
05:08:16.030 --> 05:08:22.939
Orlando Sequera: So they understand why are we? How are we? Is supporting the business with these changes?

2913
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:24.960
Orlando Sequera: A. If

2914
05:08:25.450 --> 05:08:32.540
Orlando Sequera: If we are in an organization that is transitioning to an agile mindset and an agile approach.

2915
05:08:33.620 --> 05:08:34.510
Orlando Sequera: A

2916
05:08:34.580 --> 05:08:40.480
Orlando Sequera: ideally, we have to do as much as possible to enable that agile operating system

2917
05:08:40.520 --> 05:08:50.999
Orlando Sequera: that goes with understanding, agile as a discipline, as an approach, and understanding that Agile is not just having the agile ceremonies, and

2918
05:08:51.190 --> 05:09:09.080
Orlando Sequera: having a fancy dashboard with all the work that it's been done with the per backlog. That is not that is a part of it. But the more they, but more importantly, it's about an agile mindset embracing change, and how we are

2919
05:09:09.090 --> 05:09:17.619
Orlando Sequera: a adopting those principles and understanding those principles, and in those values, and how we can implement.

2920
05:09:17.730 --> 05:09:24.610
Orlando Sequera: how can we, tailor that approach to be successful in adapting to changes. That's

2921
05:09:24.640 --> 05:09:31.009
Orlando Sequera: a big portion, and not an and and we mean enabled not an agile operating system. So

2922
05:09:31.780 --> 05:09:35.020
Orlando Sequera: the organization doesn't become a hindrance to

2923
05:09:35.410 --> 05:09:52.670
Orlando Sequera: that a to embrace changes so so we don't have roadblocks within the processes. Easier said than done right. That takes the the agile transformation it can take can take some time. It it. It depends on the level of maturity that you're going to. System has when it comes to agile.

2924
05:09:52.680 --> 05:09:55.780
Orlando Sequera: But we have to start at the individual level.

2925
05:09:55.850 --> 05:10:09.009
Orlando Sequera: and we can start with a team. Are we going to transform the entire? The entire organization just on our own? No, but that's part of our contribution. We can start working with what we can influence, which is our project team in.

2926
05:10:09.100 --> 05:10:23.840
Orlando Sequera: We can facilitate the adoption of that agile mindset, and of course, the the different tools and techniques that come associated with agile. So we can do it. Our at our individual a project level

2927
05:10:24.050 --> 05:10:27.219
Orlando Sequera: and another way to support change is.

2928
05:10:28.320 --> 05:10:30.179
Orlando Sequera: And do you know this for a fact?

2929
05:10:30.570 --> 05:10:32.100
Orlando Sequera: Knowledge is always

2930
05:10:32.210 --> 05:10:37.820
Orlando Sequera: changing and evolving. We, in in that means that we have to keep up with current trends.

2931
05:10:37.960 --> 05:10:42.259
Orlando Sequera: It's about continuous improvement, and that's where we can leverage lessons. Learn

2932
05:10:42.300 --> 05:10:44.000
Orlando Sequera: a and always

2933
05:10:44.090 --> 05:10:48.360
Orlando Sequera: try to make sure that we're keeping up with it, with the changes

2934
05:10:48.550 --> 05:10:53.910
Orlando Sequera: that are occurring in the industry that are applicable to what we do. That is, continuous improvement.

2935
05:10:54.020 --> 05:10:56.630
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So those are the recommended actions.

2936
05:10:57.170 --> 05:10:59.920
Orlando Sequera: They no no, or they don't, are.

2937
05:11:00.090 --> 05:11:04.269
Orlando Sequera: Do not force these changes, and unfortunately, many organizations.

2938
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:14.589
Orlando Sequera: don't follow this approach. They try to impose. They try to force. They try to a brute force, a change, and that usually has a negative impact.

2939
05:11:14.610 --> 05:11:15.370
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2940
05:11:16.120 --> 05:11:21.239
Orlando Sequera: it's about consulting it's about a involving people in this

2941
05:11:21.620 --> 05:11:31.890
Orlando Sequera: change processes and get their buying and the for them to understand the the rationale or the justification of those changes. And also

2942
05:11:32.340 --> 05:11:38.759
Orlando Sequera: another aspect. And this is gonna come. This is gonna be a topic that we're gonna cover in the class later.

2943
05:11:39.050 --> 05:11:41.500
Orlando Sequera: It's throughout the week. It's about

2944
05:11:42.450 --> 05:11:43.780
Orlando Sequera: conflict management

2945
05:11:44.000 --> 05:11:48.100
Orlando Sequera: changes. As we said before, human nature were resistant to change

2946
05:11:48.450 --> 05:11:53.030
Orlando Sequera: the I. I am sure that all of you can relate to that

2947
05:11:53.760 --> 05:12:00.760
Orlando Sequera: going back to the example of the software for the coming department, not because the stakeholders thing that that is.

2948
05:12:00.870 --> 05:12:06.550
Orlando Sequera: that's what we need. We need to automate a few processes. Maybe the people that are working with the current

2949
05:12:06.700 --> 05:12:15.100
Orlando Sequera: software. They're not happy with this changes. They don't. They don't wanna they don't want to change they They'd be using that software for 20 years. So if we

2950
05:12:15.690 --> 05:12:16.790
Orlando Sequera: alienate.

2951
05:12:16.940 --> 05:12:21.170
Orlando Sequera: we ignore those resistors, then

2952
05:12:21.560 --> 05:12:24.690
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna be in trouble, because that's where conflict

2953
05:12:25.050 --> 05:12:28.140
Orlando Sequera: negative conflict is going to rise, and

2954
05:12:28.460 --> 05:12:30.550
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna be

2955
05:12:31.080 --> 05:12:42.189
Orlando Sequera: a hindrance to our roadmap to to to our project success. Okay. So we need to address that. We need to. It's about communication. It's about engagement getting by in

2956
05:12:42.490 --> 05:12:57.460
Orlando Sequera: providing the information that they need. So they understand the benefits. That's why we work with the benefits management plan. So people understand well by automating an example. Probably mansion plan benefits mentioned plan world. We're going to automate processes that are currently done manually

2957
05:12:57.510 --> 05:13:14.330
Orlando Sequera: that are taking days to complete and generate reports, this is going to be automated. This is gonna be the Mo almost in real time that those are. That's part of the information that we can have in benefits matching plan. That's why we created not just because we created to justify a

2958
05:13:14.540 --> 05:13:27.150
Orlando Sequera: they the Our project as part of justification, is part of the benefits that coming to the business with the implementation of this project. And that's also gonna help us to address this aspect of

2959
05:13:27.160 --> 05:13:43.949
Orlando Sequera: resistors, cause they're gonna they're gonna that's gonna happen. Not everybody is gonna always be a supporter of your project. You might have some or sisters, and you need to address them. It's about communication. It's about engagement. It's not about forcing the change. That is, the worst recipe

2960
05:13:43.960 --> 05:13:48.310
Orlando Sequera: a that that's a recipe for destruction. Actually so self-destruction

2961
05:13:48.360 --> 05:13:50.539
Orlando Sequera: it is about getting by in

2962
05:13:50.900 --> 05:13:55.200
Orlando Sequera: communication engagement. Let them know why you want to complete

2963
05:13:55.250 --> 05:13:57.469
Orlando Sequera: that particular project. Okay.

2964
05:13:58.850 --> 05:14:05.700
Orlando Sequera: all right. I will have one to check the

2965
05:14:06.600 --> 05:14:07.190
the

2966
05:14:08.760 --> 05:14:12.040
Orlando Sequera: I want to check the Q. A.

2967
05:14:14.090 --> 05:14:15.590
Orlando Sequera: There's a question

2968
05:14:17.770 --> 05:14:20.930
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. And a. Section, if I may

2969
05:14:22.090 --> 05:14:27.559
Orlando Sequera: in maintenance and operation plan. That's not. That does not have a defined, and

2970
05:14:27.610 --> 05:14:32.490
Orlando Sequera: which that's not me the definition of a project. What type of procedures in this? Well, that's

2971
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:49.869
Orlando Sequera: You can answer yourself with the same question that that is, operations that still project management. Right? So do you have. You might have a a functional manager leading that, or a group of people leading that. But it's it's part of operations. You have functional managers and a

2972
05:14:50.220 --> 05:14:57.380
Orlando Sequera: upper management working with that maintenance and operation. So functional managers that's going to be the answer to that.

2973
05:15:01.810 --> 05:15:07.119
Orlando Sequera: We just talked about an example of a benefits management plan.

2974
05:15:11.120 --> 05:15:12.000
Okay.

2975
05:15:13.260 --> 05:15:15.870
Orlando Sequera: I like to see

2976
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:21.710
Orlando Sequera: Project sponsors. Don't usually involve and consult.

2977
05:15:22.510 --> 05:15:26.360
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that if that's the case in your projects, you're in trouble

2978
05:15:26.480 --> 05:15:34.220
Orlando Sequera: they should. They are vested in the project. They the biggest advocate that you have in any project is your sponsor. If they're not involved with the project you're in.

2979
05:15:34.420 --> 05:15:38.950
Orlando Sequera: I right at right at the gate. Good you you

2980
05:15:39.370 --> 05:15:46.470
Orlando Sequera: usually, when it probably gets to a program manager. This is already at the Don't Deal.

2981
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:52.699
Orlando Sequera: It has been selected, if you mean it in that regard and read a question from the Q. A. By the way.

2982
05:15:53.220 --> 05:15:54.550
Orlando Sequera: you sure he doesn't feed

2983
05:15:54.720 --> 05:15:57.209
Orlando Sequera: all the team members and their directive

2984
05:16:00.170 --> 05:16:06.559
Orlando Sequera: buy in any techniques to share how to best cast your product with a positive connotation, but less.

2985
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:26.740
Orlando Sequera: That's what we're trying to to do with Project Management right? It's about building. That is the benefits management plan? That's part of that answer. What are the benefits that come with this project? This is how this project is align with the strategic goals of reduce or increasing the efficiency of the counting department by 20. So that is.

2986
05:16:26.850 --> 05:16:28.920
Orlando Sequera: that's partly by him in

2987
05:16:29.410 --> 05:16:42.430
Orlando Sequera: by automation. That's just an example. Reports are taking days to generate. Now we can create, generate them in pretty much real time. So that's how you get. Buy in front. You address risk for sisters.

2988
05:16:43.150 --> 05:16:44.890
Orlando Sequera: A

2989
05:16:51.740 --> 05:16:53.230
Orlando Sequera: another question.

2990
05:16:57.260 --> 05:16:59.230
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

2991
05:17:00.090 --> 05:17:04.460
Orlando Sequera: If project sponsors have already green, led the project, why is

2992
05:17:05.160 --> 05:17:09.780
Orlando Sequera: the owners on the Pm. To support and change to a common level of assistance within the organization. Well.

2993
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:12.640
Orlando Sequera: remember, do you have a product sponsor?

2994
05:17:12.750 --> 05:17:40.990
Orlando Sequera: It could be the Director of Finance. But do you have a group of people that are going to be using the software for the accounting department. It's not going to be just him or her. It's gonna be all their people right. So you gotta get their buying and you're gonna get the buying from people from other departments to it. Most likely it's going to be supporting that. Software, so everything that you do has relationship to the other. It it's not a vacuum. It has really. It affects multiple groups of people, and you gotta get their buy in.

2995
05:17:41.000 --> 05:17:43.800
Orlando Sequera: When we talk about.

2996
05:17:43.820 --> 05:17:47.779
Orlando Sequera: When we talk about a stakeholders, it's going to make a little bit more sense.

2997
05:17:49.320 --> 05:17:54.220
Orlando Sequera: Another question: how do you get by in front of sisters. I just mentioned that through communication.

2998
05:17:54.980 --> 05:18:01.360
Orlando Sequera: showing them, and like an explain to addressing the question first of all, by understanding their questions.

2999
05:18:01.500 --> 05:18:07.450
Orlando Sequera: understanding where they come from, they might have valid points that might help you. You might be missing some

3000
05:18:07.470 --> 05:18:18.480
Orlando Sequera: key points. They might help you with that. It's about communication understanding where they're coming from their position, and also making sure that they understand the benefits that come with your project

3001
05:18:28.740 --> 05:18:34.429
Orlando Sequera: about co-worker resistance that's outside of the that that's outside of this cover project management. That's not

3002
05:18:34.590 --> 05:18:39.090
Orlando Sequera: not project management that work with the functional manager.

3003
05:18:43.000 --> 05:18:44.880
Okay.

3004
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:55.460
Orlando Sequera: the

3005
05:18:56.720 --> 05:19:01.809
Orlando Sequera: Do you have any real work examples. Well, it depends on your project. Projects are different, right? I have

3006
05:19:01.880 --> 05:19:04.130
Orlando Sequera: worked in similar products, developing

3007
05:19:04.350 --> 05:19:06.880
Orlando Sequera: software for new departments and

3008
05:19:06.920 --> 05:19:07.590
Orlando Sequera: 4

3009
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:17.759
Orlando Sequera: departments in the organization and communicate to them the benefits that are associated with this new. So accounting software, you're gonna be able to generate reports

3010
05:19:17.950 --> 05:19:29.829
Orlando Sequera: in real time pretty much compared to the 3 days that it's taking you right. Now, if you do that, if you're able to present that information and show them that you're gonna make their lives. Easter. You're gonna get their buy-in

3011
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:44.620
right.

3012
05:19:49.060 --> 05:19:51.070
Orlando Sequera: There's a question about.

3013
05:19:57.040 --> 05:20:00.130
Orlando Sequera: There is a question.

3014
05:20:02.460 --> 05:20:14.569
Orlando Sequera: You see the project sponsor who does a price selection? No. Usually you have a steering committee, a a group of people. It's usually a group of people, opera management opera management that make that decision

3015
05:20:16.470 --> 05:20:17.790
Orlando Sequera: Directors

3016
05:20:18.250 --> 05:20:21.550
Orlando Sequera: like. So it depends on the organization, but it's usually a group of people.

3017
05:20:23.520 --> 05:20:35.150
Orlando Sequera: The project sponsor is the main advocate for that project. Someone that is fast on the project was to make sure they has authority, Someone at that label from upper management as as

3018
05:20:35.520 --> 05:20:50.479
Orlando Sequera: high level of a 30, and it's going to be the best advocate for the project, and you need to build a relationship with that product. Sponsor it's gonna be a sort. Her intention for that project to be successful. For example, for the accounting software.

3019
05:20:50.590 --> 05:20:51.810
Orlando Sequera: a project.

3020
05:20:52.460 --> 05:20:55.649
Orlando Sequera: an example of a sponsor, could be the director of accounting

3021
05:20:55.980 --> 05:20:57.990
Orlando Sequera: like that. That could be an example

3022
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:59.320
Orlando Sequera: so

3023
05:20:59.450 --> 05:21:01.830
Orlando Sequera: want to make sure this pro gets successful. At least

3024
05:21:01.870 --> 05:21:07.610
Orlando Sequera: their name associated with that project, so build that relationship with him on her

3025
05:21:07.710 --> 05:21:15.520
Orlando Sequera: as quickly as possible, and leverage their authority, leverage their help, leverage leverage their knowledge

3026
05:21:15.820 --> 05:21:22.790
Orlando Sequera: if they're investing in the project, they want this product to be successful, so work with your sponsor. It's a key stakeholder. By the way.

3027
05:21:32.500 --> 05:21:34.650
let me see.

3028
05:21:36.280 --> 05:21:37.649
So this is

3029
05:21:38.480 --> 05:21:39.990
Orlando Sequera: answered.

3030
05:21:48.420 --> 05:21:50.360
Orlando Sequera: Test Prep. 21.

3031
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:54.030
Orlando Sequera: There's a question about which desperate the Mp. 2,021.

3032
05:21:55.800 --> 05:21:57.920
Orlando Sequera: Okay, the chat is on post.

3033
05:22:02.540 --> 05:22:17.490
Orlando Sequera: Could the price sponsor be external in some cases? Yes, but it depends on the organization. You need to find out who the sponsor is. It's part of your job as a Pm. It changes from organization to organization, from industry to industry, but it's part. Your job to understand who the sponsor is.

3034
05:22:17.500 --> 05:22:23.570
Orlando Sequera: You need to work, and understanding that it's not. If if there's a pmo in some cases, yeah, it's going to be given to you.

3035
05:22:24.060 --> 05:22:28.940
Orlando Sequera: You gotta do the into work. You're gonna do the leg work. Okay, you gotta do the network.

3036
05:22:30.330 --> 05:22:34.090
Orlando Sequera: Can you have multiple sponsors in some cases yes.

3037
05:22:34.580 --> 05:22:39.019
Orlando Sequera: not common. I'm going to say it's not common. It's usually one individual.

3038
05:22:39.480 --> 05:22:40.260
Orlando Sequera: but

3039
05:22:40.490 --> 05:22:42.630
Orlando Sequera: it it is, it is possible.

3040
05:22:46.640 --> 05:22:47.550
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3041
05:22:47.850 --> 05:22:49.340
Orlando Sequera: How can we

3042
05:22:52.760 --> 05:22:54.250
Orlando Sequera: plan for change.

3043
05:22:56.040 --> 05:23:01.300
Orlando Sequera: and remember that we went to. We want to make sure that these changes are not

3044
05:23:01.380 --> 05:23:06.549
Orlando Sequera: for that particular moment. We want to changes to be a to be permanent.

3045
05:23:06.580 --> 05:23:09.489
Orlando Sequera: So we have to plan for that. So

3046
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:15.109
Orlando Sequera: we need to have this plan for change change implementation. So you can

3047
05:23:15.310 --> 05:23:20.489
Orlando Sequera: for your for implementing the project and managing the change that is coming associated with our project.

3048
05:23:20.800 --> 05:23:21.420
So

3049
05:23:21.500 --> 05:23:22.809
Orlando Sequera: we might have

3050
05:23:23.880 --> 05:23:25.500
Orlando Sequera: great projects

3051
05:23:25.560 --> 05:23:31.350
Orlando Sequera: that are successfully planned for the sign implemented and delivered.

3052
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:33.630
Orlando Sequera: but they can fail

3053
05:23:33.880 --> 05:23:35.500
Orlando Sequera: in execution

3054
05:23:35.680 --> 05:23:45.269
Orlando Sequera: if we do not date. If we do not take this into account. If we don't plan for change, the implementation is gonna fail. So we have to.

3055
05:23:45.360 --> 05:23:59.889
Orlando Sequera: When we, When what we mean by planning for change, we to understand what about knowledge transfer, how we're going to transfer that knowledge from the project team to the people that are going to be using the product service of result. The accounting, software for example.

3056
05:24:00.210 --> 05:24:03.300
Orlando Sequera: the people that are going to be working with that in

3057
05:24:03.890 --> 05:24:06.270
Orlando Sequera: with that new software.

3058
05:24:06.940 --> 05:24:11.150
Orlando Sequera: How are we going to transfer that knowledge that involves documentation

3059
05:24:11.380 --> 05:24:18.310
Orlando Sequera: that involves a training that we have to provide. We have to coordinate that training with them. We also have to.

3060
05:24:18.360 --> 05:24:21.270
Orlando Sequera: They perform all the transfer with the

3061
05:24:21.570 --> 05:24:27.279
Orlando Sequera: with another department within the organization, because chances are that we're not going to be supporting

3062
05:24:27.700 --> 05:24:44.650
Orlando Sequera: any problems. There's gonna be it. It support help, desk people. They're the ones that are gonna be supporting the accounting users with the software if they have any promise. So we have to. We have to perform some knowledge, transfer activities with those that are gonna be supporting

3063
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:56.399
Orlando Sequera: the actual application in this case. Once we deploy the software for the accounting department, and they might also need to go for training, right? So it's a lot of it's it's a lot of

3064
05:24:56.600 --> 05:25:02.760
Orlando Sequera: coordination that needs to happen is not just about the word that needs to be done for the project. It's also about

3065
05:25:03.060 --> 05:25:13.099
Orlando Sequera: planning for that change and implementing that change that comes with our project right? The change that comes with our software for that kind of department. So it starts with

3066
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:19.229
Orlando Sequera: a survey to understand how people are feeling. This is how you're gonna find out who those resistors are.

3067
05:25:19.420 --> 05:25:22.840
Orlando Sequera: How are they feeling about the the the project then

3068
05:25:23.660 --> 05:25:34.270
Orlando Sequera: create a campaign to familiarize people with changes, and mainly showing them the benefits that come with this new software, your

3069
05:25:34.280 --> 05:25:49.449
Orlando Sequera: your your reports are gonna be able to be generated quicker. You can create users, and you can in a in a more efficient way, or you don't need to have a special login or a create a new account. This is this: software has single sign on.

3070
05:25:49.520 --> 05:25:59.460
Orlando Sequera: for example, right? So what are they? Benefits that come associated with this change? That's the informational campaign, and also in some cases.

3071
05:26:00.300 --> 05:26:11.450
Orlando Sequera: No. In some cases, in all cases you have to be transparent about some potential effects of the changes. Perhaps there was a change in in a regulation or a law.

3072
05:26:11.810 --> 05:26:14.330
Orlando Sequera: or a that is.

3073
05:26:14.590 --> 05:26:25.939
Orlando Sequera: that is related to the accounting guidelines that the organization is following. And now we have to collect this or track this information in a different way.

3074
05:26:25.970 --> 05:26:27.370
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

3075
05:26:27.530 --> 05:26:29.920
Orlando Sequera: if that's the case. Then

3076
05:26:30.720 --> 05:26:32.589
Orlando Sequera: we need to make sure that

3077
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:34.710
Orlando Sequera: our users understand

3078
05:26:34.820 --> 05:26:36.330
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders understand

3079
05:26:36.750 --> 05:26:44.990
Orlando Sequera: the impact of those changes that we that have been implemented in this a new accounting software, for example, and then

3080
05:26:45.730 --> 05:26:50.420
Orlando Sequera: make sure that you have a plan for that implementation. That's what we call a rollout plan

3081
05:26:50.430 --> 05:27:17.169
Orlando Sequera: that is important to have in place because it covers all that knowledge, transfer activities, a training and getting people ready and getting the environment ready, making sure that your environment is ready, so you can then implement and successfully transition your project into production. So you have to plan for that change. So it's not just the work that has been done with the project. So so how we're going to implement that into a production, so it becomes operational.

3082
05:27:17.660 --> 05:27:20.720
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to review.

3083
05:27:27.920 --> 05:27:36.119
Orlando Sequera: There's also important information. Kara, be, please check the chat Carl is putting in important information in the chat. Please make sure that you review that

3084
05:27:36.430 --> 05:27:38.270
Orlando Sequera: A.

3085
05:27:38.520 --> 05:27:40.600
Orlando Sequera: Can. You have 2 Pm. On a project.

3086
05:27:40.930 --> 05:27:43.849
Orlando Sequera: Normally? No, no. I'm gonna say no.

3087
05:27:44.200 --> 05:27:45.810
Orlando Sequera: Yeah one. It's your project.

3088
05:27:46.280 --> 05:27:47.919
Orlando Sequera: You have one Pm.

3089
05:27:48.160 --> 05:27:50.910
Orlando Sequera: Can you work with a program manager? Yes, but

3090
05:27:51.120 --> 05:27:52.110
Orlando Sequera: your project.

3091
05:28:00.920 --> 05:28:07.040
Orlando Sequera: and if you have questions of our resources, please make sure that you use the Q. A. For that. Remember what we said. Right.

3092
05:28:07.080 --> 05:28:09.809
Orlando Sequera: Let's keep the chat for content related questions

3093
05:28:10.440 --> 05:28:12.600
Orlando Sequera: and use the Q. And a.

3094
05:28:12.660 --> 05:28:24.290
Orlando Sequera: For resource related questions. But there's some information. That's why we have the videos always refer to the videos that's gonna help you answer some of the questions that you have about the resources.

3095
05:28:25.560 --> 05:28:26.170
Orlando Sequera: A.

3096
05:28:26.820 --> 05:28:28.570
Orlando Sequera: Let me review

3097
05:28:29.790 --> 05:28:30.830
Orlando Sequera: questions.

3098
05:28:30.970 --> 05:28:50.410
Orlando Sequera: Russian approach to mark in order to deliver it sooner. But in some cases it if that's what's going to have value going back to value. That's what needs to be done. It's not up to us. It's up to the stakeholders. We're not there to question them. We're there to support them, and to implement these changes. If that's what's going to drive value. That's what we do.

3099
05:28:50.990 --> 05:28:52.160
A.

3100
05:28:55.950 --> 05:28:56.690
All right.

3101
05:29:03.550 --> 05:29:04.920
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3102
05:29:10.610 --> 05:29:14.280
Orlando Sequera: there's another question. That's appropriate to have resources assigned to. We call the project.

3103
05:29:14.600 --> 05:29:18.970
Orlando Sequera: I do not know how you can complete a project without resources.

3104
05:29:19.170 --> 05:29:21.300
Orlando Sequera: so you need resources for your project.

3105
05:29:27.870 --> 05:29:28.820
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3106
05:29:34.470 --> 05:29:44.580
Orlando Sequera: There's a question which in the Q. A. The roller plan is not an independent within the project management plan. When we talk about the procedure plan, we it's. It's a big umbrella

3107
05:29:44.650 --> 05:29:52.440
Orlando Sequera: that covers multiple areas of your project. But the Rollo plan is not one of those components. That's what they mean by that last

3108
05:29:52.520 --> 05:29:53.530
Orlando Sequera: bullet point.

3109
05:30:03.660 --> 05:30:06.810
Orlando Sequera: Reviewing the

3110
05:30:07.110 --> 05:30:11.339
Orlando Sequera: Q. A. Is the exam, Continental and current? The answer is, Yes.

3111
05:30:11.380 --> 05:30:15.919
Orlando Sequera: capital with capital letters. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3112
05:30:16.440 --> 05:30:19.259
Orlando Sequera: asked. We have set before multiple times.

3113
05:30:19.660 --> 05:30:26.469
Orlando Sequera: It is the the PIN book is a different cycle. The Exam content outline outline for the Pmp.

3114
05:30:26.520 --> 05:30:27.470
Orlando Sequera: A

3115
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:32.650
Orlando Sequera: version that is in place at 2021. Yes, it is up to date.

3116
05:30:36.060 --> 05:30:36.830
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3117
05:30:38.630 --> 05:30:40.150
Orlando Sequera: I

3118
05:30:40.780 --> 05:30:43.280
Orlando Sequera: would like to continue with this

3119
05:30:43.980 --> 05:30:47.210
Orlando Sequera: topic of organizational transformation

3120
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:49.819
Orlando Sequera: that Pmi has put in place.

3121
05:30:50.110 --> 05:30:55.199
Orlando Sequera: They are trying to help organizations to become smarter

3122
05:30:55.750 --> 05:30:57.340
Orlando Sequera: about this.

3123
05:30:57.360 --> 05:31:01.159
Orlando Sequera: the importance of a bridging the gap

3124
05:31:01.280 --> 05:31:04.510
Orlando Sequera: between strategy and execution, because

3125
05:31:04.640 --> 05:31:11.369
Orlando Sequera: for over the years they have learned that there's there's a there. There was a a widening gap between what

3126
05:31:12.120 --> 05:31:14.640
Orlando Sequera: up a organizations wanted to implement

3127
05:31:14.790 --> 05:31:25.809
Orlando Sequera: and what was actually being implemented. So there was a gap between their strategy, and then the way they were executing those strategies. So, but they they given them

3128
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:31.800
Orlando Sequera: access to multiple resources. So that's where it these brighteline transformation.

3129
05:31:32.700 --> 05:31:35.840
Orlando Sequera: a compass is helping. It helps organization

3130
05:31:36.130 --> 05:31:47.799
Orlando Sequera: E to understand, to be able to articulate the vision and strategic objectives, to understand customer insights and global trends. And this is across functional

3131
05:31:47.860 --> 05:31:54.270
Orlando Sequera: operating system, the big that can be applied to any industry. It's basically giving them a roadmap.

3132
05:31:54.310 --> 05:32:12.829
Orlando Sequera: So so they so they can narrow that gap between their strategy and their actual execution at the Enterprise level change. Okay, so that's what the bright line initiative comes into play. That's something that Pmi has worked on to provide

3133
05:32:12.900 --> 05:32:19.469
Orlando Sequera: another research for organizations to be successful with that and the and he covers it. He has also

3134
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:24.830
Orlando Sequera: a a similar framework to add card, but it's what they call inside out employee transformation.

3135
05:32:36.420 --> 05:32:37.140
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3136
05:32:37.640 --> 05:32:38.580
Orlando Sequera: And

3137
05:32:38.710 --> 05:32:43.189
Orlando Sequera: we have been talking about support and organizational change.

3138
05:32:43.720 --> 05:32:44.930
Orlando Sequera: We went over

3139
05:32:45.100 --> 05:32:50.130
Orlando Sequera: assessing organization of culture. And this is how it is tied up to the exam Content outline.

3140
05:32:50.240 --> 05:32:54.630
Orlando Sequera: We evaluated the impact of your organization, change to project and

3141
05:32:54.830 --> 05:32:57.040
Orlando Sequera: determine the record actions.

3142
05:32:57.160 --> 05:33:03.460
Orlando Sequera: And also we went over the impact of the project to the organization and

3143
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:07.220
Orlando Sequera: how to be able to determine the require actions. That's a

3144
05:33:07.880 --> 05:33:11.599
Orlando Sequera: that's an overview of what we cover a summary of what we just cover.

3145
05:33:12.450 --> 05:33:14.929
Orlando Sequera: and that comes from the exam content out like.

3146
05:33:17.520 --> 05:33:20.460
Orlando Sequera: Now we're going to talk about project governance.

3147
05:33:21.410 --> 05:33:23.180
Orlando Sequera: This is

3148
05:33:24.460 --> 05:33:25.880
Orlando Sequera: something that

3149
05:33:26.110 --> 05:33:28.960
Orlando Sequera: experience project managers are very familiar with.

3150
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:37.760
Orlando Sequera: It is extremely important for any project manager to understand how your project is going to be supported by the organization.

3151
05:33:38.990 --> 05:33:45.650
Orlando Sequera: because every single, every single organization has a government framework.

3152
05:33:46.020 --> 05:33:58.930
Orlando Sequera: and you need to understand that it's gonna have implications on that value delivery that we mentioned that we have mentioned before. It is extremely important for you to understand that. Okay. I know that

3153
05:33:59.970 --> 05:34:01.749
Orlando Sequera: some of you before

3154
05:34:02.480 --> 05:34:05.130
Orlando Sequera: this, if especially if you're new to project management.

3155
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:12.110
Orlando Sequera: you might not be familiar with the governance that much. But this is something that is part of that organizational environment.

3156
05:34:12.910 --> 05:34:14.300
Orlando Sequera: Projects are gonna have

3157
05:34:14.340 --> 05:34:18.679
Orlando Sequera: a a level of governance, and it's gonna change from industry to industry.

3158
05:34:19.150 --> 05:34:36.810
Orlando Sequera: from organization to organizations. Some organizations have a higher level of scrutiny when it comes to project governance, and and some industries have a high level of of scrutiny when it comes to Co. To governance as well. But this is important to understand and put. Every single project is going to be governed.

3159
05:34:37.480 --> 05:34:38.460
Orlando Sequera: A.

3160
05:34:38.870 --> 05:34:50.210
Orlando Sequera: I. I don't there's gonna be a level of governance applied to every single project. It's something that we need to to understand. And what do we mean by Project Governance? You might be wondering what is that?

3161
05:34:50.250 --> 05:34:52.499
Orlando Sequera: Well, project governments. If

3162
05:34:52.930 --> 05:34:55.820
Orlando Sequera: about oversight, it's an oversight

3163
05:34:56.220 --> 05:34:57.190
Orlando Sequera: function

3164
05:34:57.490 --> 05:34:59.940
Orlando Sequera: that all organizations have.

3165
05:35:00.480 --> 05:35:06.139
Orlando Sequera: and he basically covers all the functions, the processes that are going to guide

3166
05:35:06.290 --> 05:35:08.640
Orlando Sequera: your project management activities.

3167
05:35:08.710 --> 05:35:15.659
Orlando Sequera: So we can then produce that unique product service of result that we intend to produce with our project

3168
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:22.070
Orlando Sequera: that in essence is going to meet those organizational, strategic and operational goals. Okay.

3169
05:35:22.280 --> 05:35:33.180
Orlando Sequera: and maybe wondering what? Why? Why do we want to have a governance model in place to my Project governance model in place because

3170
05:35:33.200 --> 05:35:41.009
Orlando Sequera: it gives us a single point of accountability, and it also help it's gonna help us to understand the project life cycle.

3171
05:35:41.650 --> 05:35:48.970
Orlando Sequera: It. It helps with issue management and resolution in your projects. In some cases you're going to have to escalate

3172
05:35:49.540 --> 05:35:50.700
Orlando Sequera: issues

3173
05:35:51.220 --> 05:36:02.980
Orlando Sequera: and you're gonna need help from other people. But how do we do that? The answer comes from Project Governance. That's why this is so important. And also it's gonna help you to in in understanding how

3174
05:36:03.640 --> 05:36:19.689
Orlando Sequera: to this tribute. Information about your project and clear communication guidelines is tied up to that. We do have specific. We plan for communication plan for communications, but project. Governance also has an input when it comes to

3175
05:36:19.760 --> 05:36:25.110
Orlando Sequera: a product, communication and information distribution. And it really

3176
05:36:25.650 --> 05:36:27.780
Orlando Sequera: since, if you ask me, okay, go.

3177
05:36:27.990 --> 05:36:28.780
Orlando Sequera: that's

3178
05:36:29.140 --> 05:36:42.299
Orlando Sequera: we get from private governance. Well, it's going to outline the roles with the levels of with the levels of authority, the relationships and the responsibility amongst the project stakeholders

3179
05:36:42.330 --> 05:36:47.200
Orlando Sequera: so really clear guideline when it comes to Who's who there

3180
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:52.879
Orlando Sequera: Their roles? What are their responsibilities? Where their relationships

3181
05:36:52.960 --> 05:36:54.610
Orlando Sequera: a amongst those

3182
05:36:54.670 --> 05:36:56.410
Orlando Sequera: stakeholders for our project

3183
05:36:56.560 --> 05:37:08.540
Orlando Sequera: so really important. It's really important for us to understand. And as I mentioned before, these changes from organization to organization, and it can change even from project to project, depending on what it is.

3184
05:37:08.960 --> 05:37:16.060
Orlando Sequera: what that you're trying to produce with your project, and it definitely changes from industry to industry. Okay.

3185
05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:17.960
Orlando Sequera: But we're always going to have

3186
05:37:18.040 --> 05:37:22.319
Orlando Sequera: governments in place, and you might be wondering

3187
05:37:25.150 --> 05:37:28.450
Orlando Sequera: how much governance is is needed. Right?

3188
05:37:29.700 --> 05:37:36.060
Orlando Sequera: But one thing to keep in mind. Governance is gonna be in place even before you begin working in your project.

3189
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:42.499
Orlando Sequera: It might come from the Pmo. If it's a directive pmo. Or it's going to be aligned

3190
05:37:42.800 --> 05:37:46.809
Orlando Sequera: with the actual governance policies of the organization.

3191
05:37:47.560 --> 05:37:56.239
Orlando Sequera: As a Pm. You have to adjust the governance structure for an individual project. This is going to be based on constraints and

3192
05:37:56.270 --> 05:38:03.220
Orlando Sequera: the project oversight requirements. This comes from the organization also the industry. That's why we have to pay attention to that landscape.

3193
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:06.179
Orlando Sequera: That is the organization, that ecosystem.

3194
05:38:06.270 --> 05:38:11.779
Orlando Sequera: we to understand that it it covers a internal factors and external factors.

3195
05:38:11.860 --> 05:38:19.510
Orlando Sequera: and another in many cases, in many cases, not in every single case. But in many cases another huge oversight

3196
05:38:20.200 --> 05:38:24.629
Orlando Sequera: aspect of a government for is budget.

3197
05:38:25.440 --> 05:38:32.469
Orlando Sequera: What happens when the costs exceed the benefits or the defined tolerances are

3198
05:38:33.460 --> 05:38:50.690
Orlando Sequera: actually it. The thresholds that you have for tolerance is are exceeded. What happens in those situations, so that's part of governance, and by that I mean well, we, the threshold is we can it it? It's. Okay. If we are. This is just an example

3199
05:38:50.820 --> 05:39:04.750
Orlando Sequera: plus or minus a 5%. Or if we are 5% over. Budget. It's okay. We don't have to. We we don't have to correct the the performance. We don't have to be in the performance back and track. But if we start

3200
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:20.470
Orlando Sequera: spending more than 5, we're spending 10%. We're able to determine that using earn value and environment management, what happens there? Right. So that's why we need to have governance in place. It's gonna have the answer to that. What do we do in that situation? So

3201
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:24.659
Orlando Sequera: A. And it's basically that

3202
05:39:24.710 --> 05:39:28.639
Orlando Sequera: is is part of it's a it's a big component of

3203
05:39:29.650 --> 05:39:30.800
Orlando Sequera: the

3204
05:39:31.460 --> 05:39:35.710
Orlando Sequera: of course the prevention plan will be the best analogy. But what do we do if

3205
05:39:36.330 --> 05:39:44.129
Orlando Sequera: full books that we have to, for one of the rules that we have to follow for for a project when we, when we are a.

3206
05:39:44.400 --> 05:39:52.600
Orlando Sequera: When we're experiencing situations in our projects, not everything is gonna go according to plan that never happens. That never happens. So what do we do in those situations.

3207
05:39:53.050 --> 05:39:56.810
Orlando Sequera: Part of the answers are gonna come from the project governance. Okay.

3208
05:39:56.890 --> 05:39:59.660
Orlando Sequera: They give you guidelines.

3209
05:40:01.920 --> 05:40:03.890
Orlando Sequera: They give you guidelines.

3210
05:40:04.860 --> 05:40:07.560
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to

3211
05:40:09.340 --> 05:40:15.660
Orlando Sequera: multiple aspects. They give you guidance about changes, how changes are going to be implemented there.

3212
05:40:15.890 --> 05:40:21.700
Orlando Sequera: There are guidelines about communication, about documentation, how decisions are going to be made

3213
05:40:22.120 --> 05:40:24.630
Orlando Sequera: how to

3214
05:40:24.750 --> 05:40:26.269
Orlando Sequera: make sure that

3215
05:40:26.490 --> 05:40:33.090
Orlando Sequera: your internal stakeholders are aligned with the requirements for the project, how the changes are going to be reviewed and approved.

3216
05:40:33.290 --> 05:40:37.990
Orlando Sequera: How risk an issue. Notification, Escalation of resolution is performed.

3217
05:40:38.530 --> 05:40:41.970
Orlando Sequera: stage gate, or face reviews. How are they conducted?

3218
05:40:42.410 --> 05:40:50.210
Orlando Sequera: All that is tied up to Guy to to governance? How we align project governance in organizations, strategy.

3219
05:40:51.930 --> 05:40:55.010
Orlando Sequera: the project, life, cycle and the development approach. Remember

3220
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:57.670
Orlando Sequera: adaptive, predictive or hybrid.

3221
05:40:58.410 --> 05:41:06.389
Orlando Sequera: The project or organizational chart with roles also is a component of the governance. What is the project? Success criteria

3222
05:41:06.570 --> 05:41:17.719
Orlando Sequera: and the liberal acceptance criteria and the the the relationships between the product team, different organizational groups and external stakeholders, all those are components of for their governance.

3223
05:41:17.880 --> 05:41:20.820
Orlando Sequera: It is extremely extremely important to

3224
05:41:21.500 --> 05:41:24.410
Orlando Sequera: make sure that we understand it.

3225
05:41:25.700 --> 05:41:27.800
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in

3226
05:41:28.610 --> 05:41:39.579
Orlando Sequera: the Q. A. That I would like to address how how you deal with an organization with any government there's gonna be some I haven't seen that yet there's going to be

3227
05:41:39.670 --> 05:41:41.650
Orlando Sequera: some level of government.

3228
05:41:41.730 --> 05:41:55.479
Orlando Sequera: even if it's a startup. You're gonna have one of the the 3 guys that started the company that someone is going to make the decisions, and that's governance. That's governance. You can just Nobody's gonna give you a blend check

3229
05:41:55.590 --> 05:42:04.249
Orlando Sequera: a to work on the project without asking you questions or giving you some guidance. There's gonna be some type of governance, so that is

3230
05:42:05.810 --> 05:42:12.730
Orlando Sequera: that it? It? It might be very simple, or it might be very complex, as we see here, but there is going to be some type of governance.

3231
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:29.390
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the Q. A. Who usually initiates further governance. As we said before, governments probably is. Ch chances are most likely it's gonna be in place before you start working on your project. So this is something that you. This is information that you have to

3232
05:42:30.300 --> 05:42:42.330
Orlando Sequera: find out to understand. And this is part of your job as a project manager to understand the level of governance that is applicable to your projects. But that's gonna be in place. Okay, already. You don't star that. It's.

3233
05:42:42.370 --> 05:42:44.110
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be in place already.

3234
05:42:47.190 --> 05:42:48.499
What other question

3235
05:42:51.800 --> 05:42:55.820
Orlando Sequera: is project governance similar to product controls in a way? Yes.

3236
05:43:10.580 --> 05:43:16.569
Orlando Sequera: Are there any examples of governance, frameworks, functions, or processes with? I'm sure that you can look for those.

3237
05:43:16.690 --> 05:43:17.450
Orlando Sequera: But

3238
05:43:17.690 --> 05:43:22.869
Orlando Sequera: again they change from organizations to organization, from industry to industry. They

3239
05:43:23.190 --> 05:43:28.890
Orlando Sequera: any organization that works with the Federal government, the Us. Very complex. The the

3240
05:43:29.090 --> 05:43:39.549
Orlando Sequera: both of these components are applicable to the level of governance and the depending on what it is to a industries like aerospace. They're very they. They have a very complex

3241
05:43:39.640 --> 05:43:42.500
Orlando Sequera: type of governance that is applicable not to. If you're a

3242
05:43:42.540 --> 05:43:43.630
Orlando Sequera: contractor

3243
05:43:44.220 --> 05:43:53.790
Orlando Sequera: with a government, then a multiple levels of governance, not just your own internal organization, but you do. You need to also follow the governance model of

3244
05:43:53.820 --> 05:43:59.949
Orlando Sequera: your customer organization? So it is that is important to understand.

3245
05:44:01.050 --> 05:44:01.760
Right?

3246
05:44:03.100 --> 05:44:03.950
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3247
05:44:07.630 --> 05:44:22.169
Orlando Sequera: Project. Go. Another question. Probably governance starts with stage it. It was in place before you started with your project. Chances are so. It was already in place. Just gotta make sure that you understand it, and you meet it. You meet that criteria. You follow those processes.

3248
05:44:22.670 --> 05:44:25.870
Orlando Sequera: It was already in place, but you gotta make sure that you follow it.

3249
05:44:28.490 --> 05:44:34.049
Orlando Sequera: It's it's safe. Another question. Is it safe to say that a project is managed within the governance photo.

3250
05:44:34.560 --> 05:44:41.030
Orlando Sequera: It is safe to say that a project should must be managed within the governance model. Yes, so

3251
05:44:41.950 --> 05:44:46.050
Orlando Sequera: yes, it is safe to say that project is managed within the governance model. Yes.

3252
05:44:56.280 --> 05:45:02.520
Orlando Sequera: Another question. What is the difference between iterative and incremental approaching project governance?

3253
05:45:03.010 --> 05:45:12.970
Orlando Sequera: This has nothing to do with the type of approach that you're following for your projects, regardless of the approach this has to be followed. They have.

3254
05:45:13.440 --> 05:45:14.150
yeah.

3255
05:45:14.180 --> 05:45:26.469
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the approach that you followed, your project has to meet this th, the the model for the the project governance model that is in place for the organization has nothing to do with the approach.

3256
05:45:30.020 --> 05:45:30.810
Okay

3257
05:45:44.460 --> 05:45:54.630
Orlando Sequera: will be Part is will be part of the product as well. It's more of a processes and components and a criteria. It's not about people so about processes that you have to meet.

3258
05:45:55.040 --> 05:45:56.420
Orlando Sequera: It's not about people.

3259
05:45:59.050 --> 05:46:00.100
All right.

3260
05:46:01.440 --> 05:46:02.350
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3261
05:46:05.230 --> 05:46:08.000
Orlando Sequera: Governance. When it comes to adaptive projects. So.

3262
05:46:08.040 --> 05:46:09.870
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the approach

3263
05:46:11.100 --> 05:46:17.989
Orlando Sequera: we are going to follow governments in this case. This is the example, for it's a nice segue to that question.

3264
05:46:18.060 --> 05:46:21.260
Orlando Sequera: What about adaptive projects? Do we follow governments? Yes.

3265
05:46:21.460 --> 05:46:24.660
Orlando Sequera: it but they are. It's about.

3266
05:46:25.180 --> 05:46:32.190
Orlando Sequera: They can document outputs and expectations. Remember that we're following that incremental and iterative approach.

3267
05:46:32.380 --> 05:46:41.550
Orlando Sequera: They can help to provide a a view, a clear view for the status by define iteration, spring expectations and outputs. What we

3268
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:47.169
Orlando Sequera: define expectations on those iterations right? What we're trying to produce

3269
05:46:47.530 --> 05:46:50.990
Orlando Sequera: that has to be defined clearly. We're going to produce this

3270
05:46:51.260 --> 05:46:53.530
Orlando Sequera: re monthly sales report

3271
05:46:54.010 --> 05:46:57.739
Orlando Sequera: for the accounting software that has to be. That's what we mean by define

3272
05:46:57.770 --> 05:47:00.740
Orlando Sequera: a iteration or spring expectations.

3273
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:08.959
Orlando Sequera: and it's going to be tied up to specific dates. So in this iteration that is, 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks we're going to get this

3274
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:11.690
Orlando Sequera: monthly sales report.

3275
05:47:12.050 --> 05:47:19.160
Orlando Sequera: and it helps us with real time monitoring the project output what we are producing. Comp.

3276
05:47:19.440 --> 05:47:20.350
Orlando Sequera: A

3277
05:47:20.400 --> 05:47:28.540
Orlando Sequera: throughout the iteration. We're gonna have some coordination meetings that are gonna help us to monitor that the completion of those

3278
05:47:28.870 --> 05:47:31.570
Orlando Sequera: project output in real time. So

3279
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:42.859
Orlando Sequera: project governance. What we're trying to say here is that they should not become a hindrance to the project work. It's actually the opposite. Effective governance

3280
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:45.360
Orlando Sequera: should be applied

3281
05:47:45.770 --> 05:47:46.720
Orlando Sequera: based

3282
05:47:46.800 --> 05:47:49.050
Orlando Sequera: on the approach that you are following.

3283
05:47:49.400 --> 05:47:53.360
Orlando Sequera: you still going to be governed regardless of the approach, as I said, for

3284
05:47:53.530 --> 05:47:57.470
Orlando Sequera: this governance has to be, have cannot become a hindrance

3285
05:47:57.850 --> 05:48:15.739
Orlando Sequera: to your project. It it has to be the opposite. It has to enable the project to be successful. You're still going to be governed. But you have to be governed in a way that is going to be successful, and this is a guideline for projects that are a done following another approach.

3286
05:48:15.770 --> 05:48:19.219
Orlando Sequera: But if we are following a predictive approach.

3287
05:48:19.360 --> 05:48:20.910
Orlando Sequera: you can also have

3288
05:48:21.090 --> 05:48:25.110
Orlando Sequera: something that is called. You can have a governance port.

3289
05:48:25.250 --> 05:48:33.260
Orlando Sequera: a, or steering committee, or project port. They're the ones that are going to be a providing that oversight. I'm going to make the decisions.

3290
05:48:33.360 --> 05:48:35.660
Orlando Sequera: and what they do is

3291
05:48:36.020 --> 05:48:38.580
Orlando Sequera: they include key stakeholders

3292
05:48:38.870 --> 05:48:46.809
Orlando Sequera: upper management, and they're going to be reviewing the deliverables that are being produced, and they're going to be. They're going to give guidance for

3293
05:48:46.840 --> 05:48:48.870
Orlando Sequera: project decisions, so

3294
05:48:49.020 --> 05:48:55.010
Orlando Sequera: that many organizations have a steering committee in place. They have an actual.

3295
05:48:55.880 --> 05:48:57.359
Orlando Sequera: and they also have

3296
05:48:58.710 --> 05:49:02.249
Orlando Sequera: steering committee or governance Board. Hmm. Different names.

3297
05:49:05.140 --> 05:49:06.480
A.

3298
05:49:07.610 --> 05:49:15.909
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the chat. What is the difference between iteration and spring? There's no difference between iteration and iteration is the generic term.

3299
05:49:16.560 --> 05:49:19.850
Orlando Sequera: and sprint is specific to scrum.

3300
05:49:20.120 --> 05:49:23.050
Orlando Sequera: but not all agile is crumb.

3301
05:49:23.080 --> 05:49:29.039
Orlando Sequera: So the generic term for iteration for sprint is iteration, but in essence they are the same thing.

3302
05:49:29.420 --> 05:49:30.250
That's

3303
05:49:30.640 --> 05:49:32.040
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by that.

3304
05:49:39.900 --> 05:49:46.349
Orlando Sequera: What a Pm. Or it should look like. It depends on the industry and depends on the organization that there's not really right or wrong

3305
05:49:46.750 --> 05:49:48.740
Orlando Sequera: way to have a. A.

3306
05:49:50.060 --> 05:49:52.230
Orlando Sequera: A project management organization.

3307
05:49:52.400 --> 05:49:53.620
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3308
05:50:01.600 --> 05:50:02.160
Okay.

3309
05:50:02.300 --> 05:50:04.670
Orlando Sequera: There's a question in the Q. And a.

3310
05:50:05.410 --> 05:50:10.979
Orlando Sequera: If the Exam. Asks what is the proper governance for a project that

3311
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:20.530
Orlando Sequera: it's not going to be the type of questions that you're going to be facing in your Pmp. Exam. I can tell you that right on the right. So, starting with the wrong assumption, the type of questions are

3312
05:50:20.650 --> 05:50:21.839
Orlando Sequera: they're going to give you

3313
05:50:22.900 --> 05:50:24.760
Orlando Sequera: a specific scenario.

3314
05:50:24.780 --> 05:50:37.790
Orlando Sequera: A. In this particular project. We are very familiar with the scope. We have done it before we're building a a new facility for research and development. And

3315
05:50:39.560 --> 05:50:43.470
Orlando Sequera: right now our we are.

3316
05:50:44.080 --> 05:50:54.769
Orlando Sequera: We have a Cpi, a cost performance, index of 0 point 1, and we have a a scale performance index of 0 point 2. What can you tell about that project?

3317
05:50:55.180 --> 05:50:59.960
Orlando Sequera: Those are the type of questions that you're going to be getting scenario based. They're not going to be about specific.

3318
05:51:00.070 --> 05:51:05.750
Orlando Sequera: The questions are gonna be, what did you do first? What do you do?

3319
05:51:06.090 --> 05:51:26.070
Orlando Sequera: What should you do? They're gonna be keywords in the question they're about. They they're about the scenarios that those are not. That's not the type of question that you're gonna be getting into your Pmp: exempt. So again, to really get familiarized with type of questions. Go to test, prep, and review, test, prep on their practice in percipio. So you can get a better

3320
05:51:26.080 --> 05:51:31.669
Orlando Sequera: idea of the type of questions that you're going to be facing the Pmp. Exam. They are not about definitions

3321
05:51:31.810 --> 05:51:36.640
Orlando Sequera: when it but of course, to answer the scenario based questions we need to know the definitions

3322
05:51:37.740 --> 05:51:38.640
right.

3323
05:51:39.640 --> 05:51:43.979
Orlando Sequera: A governance, as I mentioned before, is tied up to a 30.

3324
05:51:44.710 --> 05:51:46.030
Orlando Sequera: They are.

3325
05:51:46.110 --> 05:51:47.600
Orlando Sequera: The governance is gonna

3326
05:51:48.130 --> 05:51:56.220
Orlando Sequera: help us to understand. When do we have to escalate an issue? We don't understand. When do we have to escalate nature? Ideally

3327
05:51:56.850 --> 05:51:59.700
Orlando Sequera: we should try to solve as much as possible here.

3328
05:52:00.010 --> 05:52:02.479
Orlando Sequera: and for the Pmp. Exam.

3329
05:52:04.610 --> 05:52:07.479
Orlando Sequera: Try to always look for an answer

3330
05:52:08.040 --> 05:52:08.860
Orlando Sequera: that

3331
05:52:09.040 --> 05:52:17.600
Orlando Sequera: it's something that you can do as a project manager with the project team. So what i'm trying to say is that the solutions to the problems

3332
05:52:17.930 --> 05:52:19.010
Orlando Sequera: that are

3333
05:52:20.220 --> 05:52:33.650
Orlando Sequera: express in those scenario based questions with your Pmp. Exam. The right answer is going to be most of the right answers. Not all of them, but most of them are gonna be right here within the project team. There's gonna be something

3334
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:35.489
Orlando Sequera: that you can do

3335
05:52:35.620 --> 05:52:41.290
Orlando Sequera: to solve the problem. Usually escalation is not the right answer.

3336
05:52:41.470 --> 05:52:46.359
Orlando Sequera: I'm. And i'm gonna say it again. Usually, Usually i'm not saying

3337
05:52:46.460 --> 05:52:47.180
Orlando Sequera: that

3338
05:52:47.330 --> 05:52:59.290
Orlando Sequera: escalation is always the wrong answer. I'm saying, Usually escalation is not the right answer, but in some specific cases escalation is the right answer.

3339
05:52:59.800 --> 05:53:07.100
Orlando Sequera: Because escalation is is what you need to do when your level of a 30, when the situation

3340
05:53:07.390 --> 05:53:09.700
Orlando Sequera: is outside of

3341
05:53:09.730 --> 05:53:20.499
Orlando Sequera: the level of authority that you have for your project. For example, i'm going to give you a specific example that is going to help help you to understand that situation.

3342
05:53:20.600 --> 05:53:22.140
Orlando Sequera: And this happened to me.

3343
05:53:23.230 --> 05:53:27.859
Orlando Sequera: I was working in an automation project. We were

3344
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:34.080
Orlando Sequera: updating network access points for a manufacturing facility

3345
05:53:34.290 --> 05:53:35.720
Orlando Sequera: in South Florida

3346
05:53:36.040 --> 05:53:37.180
Orlando Sequera: and

3347
05:53:37.660 --> 05:53:39.950
Orlando Sequera: this manufacturer facility.

3348
05:53:40.730 --> 05:53:45.170
Orlando Sequera: They made They it's a dental implement manufacturing facility

3349
05:53:45.330 --> 05:53:46.670
Orlando Sequera: here in the Us.

3350
05:53:47.550 --> 05:53:50.619
Orlando Sequera: They are regulated by the food and drug administration.

3351
05:53:50.760 --> 05:53:57.890
Orlando Sequera: That is, the Federal Government entity that regulates that industry the FDA for food and drug administration.

3352
05:53:58.300 --> 05:54:02.090
Orlando Sequera: and we were working in the shop for replacing

3353
05:54:02.340 --> 05:54:03.380
Orlando Sequera: our

3354
05:54:04.210 --> 05:54:22.410
Orlando Sequera: network at this point, and we were performing some testing, and we were working with some of the operators, and all of a sudden we had the visit of these people that first time that I saw them in the shop floor, and they were FDA inspectors.

3355
05:54:22.700 --> 05:54:28.480
Orlando Sequera: and they told us to stop operations because they were gonna conduct and audit.

3356
05:54:30.850 --> 05:54:34.159
Orlando Sequera: So in that specific situation, and we

3357
05:54:34.580 --> 05:54:37.520
Orlando Sequera: we were working on a project. And

3358
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:39.890
Orlando Sequera: this is an FDA inspector.

3359
05:54:40.160 --> 05:54:48.439
Orlando Sequera: Tell us that we have to stop operations. We have to stop work basically because they're gonna conduct that and not it a random at it, and they have the right to do that.

3360
05:54:48.900 --> 05:54:53.309
Orlando Sequera: I didn't have. I was a project manager. I didn't have the 30 to tell them. No.

3361
05:54:53.340 --> 05:54:56.430
Orlando Sequera: Mister Inspector, you cannot do that because you are going

3362
05:54:57.200 --> 05:55:01.470
Orlando Sequera: a do you? You're going to have a do you come to a negatively impact

3363
05:55:01.600 --> 05:55:06.840
Orlando Sequera: the schedule of my project. If we don't complete this activities today, we're gonna be late.

3364
05:55:07.030 --> 05:55:12.929
Orlando Sequera: We're not going to be able to meet schedule. No, I I I don't have the 30 to do that. That's capable

3365
05:55:13.180 --> 05:55:15.769
Orlando Sequera: that is above that is, up here.

3366
05:55:16.580 --> 05:55:24.130
Orlando Sequera: That's case my level of authority. So in that case I had to escalate. I had to call my sponsor

3367
05:55:24.150 --> 05:55:26.810
Orlando Sequera: and communicate with key stakeholders

3368
05:55:27.400 --> 05:55:28.200
Orlando Sequera: to

3369
05:55:28.300 --> 05:55:29.500
Orlando Sequera: provide them

3370
05:55:30.060 --> 05:55:33.129
Orlando Sequera: to let them know that this was the situation.

3371
05:55:33.150 --> 05:55:42.039
Orlando Sequera: and that to for them to help me with with the rest, with the resolution, with the course of action, to address the situation.

3372
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:43.100
Orlando Sequera: But

3373
05:55:43.450 --> 05:55:55.689
Orlando Sequera: E. That was outside of my level of authority. I had to escalate in that situation. That might be the case. So pay attention. That's why so important to pay attention to the level of authority that you have

3374
05:55:55.780 --> 05:56:00.479
Orlando Sequera: in your project. And this situation is this something that I can address

3375
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:07.059
Orlando Sequera: unsolved within the team? Yes, do it. But if it's something that is outside of your authority, I could.

3376
05:56:07.280 --> 05:56:13.110
Orlando Sequera: for example, I I wish I could to tell an Fd. Inspector. No.

3377
05:56:13.140 --> 05:56:17.970
Orlando Sequera: we can stop operation. We gotta keep working. Otherwise we're not going to meet scheduling.

3378
05:56:18.050 --> 05:56:19.550
Orlando Sequera: No, so

3379
05:56:19.820 --> 05:56:28.850
Orlando Sequera: th the. But in most cases the right answer for the Pmp. Exam. Is going to be down here. It's going to be within the project team. So please remember that. Okay.

3380
05:56:29.140 --> 05:56:30.840
Orlando Sequera: please remember that.

3381
05:56:32.520 --> 05:56:33.680
And

3382
05:56:44.320 --> 05:56:50.620
Orlando Sequera: in government for governance. You're going to have a lot of opa. I see a question in the Q. A. About

3383
05:56:51.760 --> 05:56:58.990
Orlando Sequera: a governance and opa, and ef no, it's, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a a multiple opa that you have to review.

3384
05:56:59.130 --> 05:56:59.750
Okay.

3385
05:57:04.270 --> 05:57:14.009
Orlando Sequera: there's another question. How's the level of tutorials? Define a game that changes from industry to industry. You need to know that that's part of your job as a Pm. You need to understand

3386
05:57:14.050 --> 05:57:31.409
Orlando Sequera: the type of that's why you need to understand the type of organizational structure. Is this a functional organization? Is it a matrix based organization? It's a project ties. It comes from there. We cover that. So remember that you need to. You need to do your leg work. It's not going to it's not going to be given to you.

3387
05:57:31.710 --> 05:57:36.560
Orlando Sequera: So that's gonna dictate the level of authority that you have pay attention to the type of struct

3388
05:57:36.630 --> 05:57:44.179
Orlando Sequera: to organ the type of organizational structure that you have in the organization. That's why you need to understand that organizational culture.

3389
05:57:45.100 --> 05:57:45.790
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3390
05:57:49.170 --> 05:57:49.960
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3391
05:57:50.470 --> 05:57:51.590
Orlando Sequera: then.

3392
05:57:51.630 --> 05:58:00.270
Orlando Sequera: But for the exam, as I mentioned, key takeaway from here is that most of the answers are going to be within

3393
05:58:00.330 --> 05:58:08.769
Orlando Sequera: your level of authority for you to solve it with a project team. Okay. But if it's outside of this, then you have to escalate.

3394
05:58:08.840 --> 05:58:09.480
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3395
05:58:10.750 --> 05:58:21.130
Orlando Sequera: So most of them are gonna be within the threshold, and you need to work with the team to find the resolution. Most of the Pmp. Answers. Correct answers are gonna be under that second bullet.

3396
05:58:30.580 --> 05:58:32.920
Orlando Sequera: Where is the threshold in the kid on the graph?

3397
05:58:33.300 --> 05:58:35.350
Orlando Sequera: It's the same as the level of tolerance.

3398
05:58:39.490 --> 05:58:41.680
Orlando Sequera: It's the same as the level of tolerance.

3399
05:58:49.130 --> 05:58:49.980
All right.

3400
05:58:52.240 --> 05:58:53.060
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3401
05:58:53.570 --> 05:58:57.079
Orlando Sequera: And let's take a look at the governance and life cycles

3402
05:58:57.340 --> 05:58:58.820
Orlando Sequera: a

3403
05:58:59.350 --> 05:59:04.520
Orlando Sequera: governing systems. They work along alongside the value delivery system.

3404
05:59:05.060 --> 05:59:08.270
Orlando Sequera: they which is a for their life cycle. And

3405
05:59:08.730 --> 05:59:12.759
Orlando Sequera: why? Because we want to have. We want to be able to enhance

3406
05:59:12.880 --> 05:59:18.889
Orlando Sequera: those smooth workflows. Do you want to be able to manage issues and support that decision? Making

3407
05:59:19.090 --> 05:59:20.380
Orlando Sequera: value delivery

3408
05:59:20.780 --> 05:59:23.159
Orlando Sequera: as a product of the life cycle?

3409
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:25.460
Orlando Sequera: It that is in predictive right.

3410
05:59:25.660 --> 05:59:31.030
Orlando Sequera: And but if we're following a module approach value, delivery is embedded in the life cycle.

3411
05:59:31.420 --> 05:59:42.180
Orlando Sequera: so value delivery is a product of the life cycle in predictive, but value delivery is going to be embedded in your agile a life cycle. So

3412
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:49.820
Orlando Sequera: there is a principle, and this comes from your seventh edition recognize and evaluate and respond to systems interactions.

3413
05:59:51.060 --> 05:59:51.730
Okay.

3414
05:59:52.090 --> 06:00:01.419
Orlando Sequera: this is this is important because it shows the potential relationship between value delivery and the type of life cycle that you're using for your project

3415
06:00:02.710 --> 06:00:04.930
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to checkpoints

3416
06:00:06.520 --> 06:00:07.570
Orlando Sequera: for

3417
06:00:07.900 --> 06:00:09.130
Orlando Sequera: your project

3418
06:00:09.920 --> 06:00:17.960
Orlando Sequera: depending on the approach that you're following. The checkpoints are also known as Face Gates. Most some of you might know them as face gates

3419
06:00:18.960 --> 06:00:26.359
Orlando Sequera: when it comes. If we're following a predictive approach, we're usually we're going to divide the work into faces.

3420
06:00:26.820 --> 06:00:32.189
Orlando Sequera: And at the end of each face we're going to review what we produce in that face

3421
06:00:32.480 --> 06:00:39.889
Orlando Sequera: and that review has multiple names. Make sure that you get familiarized with those names because they can.

3422
06:00:40.010 --> 06:00:57.789
Orlando Sequera: They can ask you in the exam. They can use different terminology, but they refer to the same thing that you're gonna start learning that in the Pmp. Content we have multiple names for the same thing. So this is one example. These review. They say gates reviews. They're also known as governance gates.

3423
06:00:57.990 --> 06:01:03.019
Orlando Sequera: They're also known as skill points when you might be under a kill point. Why kill point? Because

3424
06:01:03.120 --> 06:01:05.629
Orlando Sequera: some cases this can drive termination.

3425
06:01:05.830 --> 06:01:10.220
Orlando Sequera: The the project is terminated at the end of this face that happens. That's why they use

3426
06:01:10.240 --> 06:01:13.750
Orlando Sequera: kill, point, or in some cases they call it toll gate.

3427
06:01:13.930 --> 06:01:18.019
Orlando Sequera: but they all the same, it's that review that happens at the end of the face.

3428
06:01:18.180 --> 06:01:22.009
Orlando Sequera: And what happens here on their predictive is at this

3429
06:01:22.030 --> 06:01:24.139
Orlando Sequera: states reviews or face gates.

3430
06:01:24.420 --> 06:01:26.530
Orlando Sequera: What we try

3431
06:01:26.680 --> 06:01:28.320
Orlando Sequera: to decide, if

3432
06:01:29.320 --> 06:01:32.289
Orlando Sequera: can we continue to the next phase? Yes or no?

3433
06:01:32.360 --> 06:01:35.480
Orlando Sequera: And if the answer is, No, that's usually a kill point.

3434
06:01:36.010 --> 06:01:43.930
Orlando Sequera: Can we continue with modifications? Or is this the end of the project or program? That's what happens at the end. If we're following a predictive

3435
06:01:43.960 --> 06:01:50.339
Orlando Sequera: life cycle right at the end of each phase. If we're following an adaptive or agile life cycle.

3436
06:01:50.690 --> 06:01:56.659
Orlando Sequera: we divide the work, not interfaces, got into releases any that release.

3437
06:01:56.730 --> 06:02:01.039
Orlando Sequera: We group a release is a group of multiple

3438
06:02:01.100 --> 06:02:03.170
Orlando Sequera: iterations or sprints

3439
06:02:03.220 --> 06:02:08.790
Orlando Sequera: in which we combine functionality. Usually functionality that is related.

3440
06:02:09.300 --> 06:02:10.730
Orlando Sequera: so we can then

3441
06:02:10.800 --> 06:02:17.290
Orlando Sequera: release it together into production. An example of Imagine if we're trying to develop

3442
06:02:18.930 --> 06:02:25.549
Orlando Sequera: a new messaging application that will compete with Whatsapp or telegram. Right messaging application.

3443
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:34.260
Orlando Sequera: A. Probably most of you I want. I want to. I want to think that all of you know about Whatsapp right, that is, one by Facebook. So you can send messages to groups and individuals.

3444
06:02:34.400 --> 06:02:41.119
Orlando Sequera: So let's assume for a minute that that's where we are. We're working on a project related to Whatsapp.

3445
06:02:41.140 --> 06:02:48.500
Orlando Sequera: and we have been able to determine that for our customers their main concern right now is about security.

3446
06:02:48.610 --> 06:02:50.460
Orlando Sequera: Our customers. Are

3447
06:02:50.630 --> 06:02:57.820
Orlando Sequera: they really want to make sure that their information is protected, and that Whatsapp is a secure, mobile application. So

3448
06:02:58.560 --> 06:03:17.189
Orlando Sequera: chances are that in our project all the functionality associated with security is gonna move to the forefront. It's gonna to move to the top of the pile that we call product backlog, by the way, so it it's gonna be the that's the priority right now. So we can group functionality associated with security.

3449
06:03:17.200 --> 06:03:25.819
Orlando Sequera: Maybe it's gonna take us more than one iteration, because, remember, iteration in average is going to be 2 weeks anywhere between one week to 4 weeks. But

3450
06:03:25.910 --> 06:03:33.250
Orlando Sequera: most organizations use that duration of 2 weeks. So what organizations do when it comes to releases. They group

3451
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:38.719
Orlando Sequera: multiple iterations or sprints associated in this example to security.

3452
06:03:39.290 --> 06:03:43.780
Orlando Sequera: and once that functionality is complete, they're going to release it together

3453
06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:53.780
Orlando Sequera: to production. That's what we mean. Splitting the work into releases this strategic grouping of similar functionality, not necessarily similar, but functionality. That is

3454
06:03:53.860 --> 06:03:57.929
Orlando Sequera: the highest priority for our stakeholders. Okay, for

3455
06:03:58.140 --> 06:04:03.689
Orlando Sequera: so that's it's a it's a it's a way to group it together. So it gets released at the same time

3456
06:04:04.080 --> 06:04:14.760
Orlando Sequera: the reviews are going to be done. Not at the end of each face. They're going to be done more often at the end of each print. We're going to do the same thing the same

3457
06:04:14.790 --> 06:04:20.050
Orlando Sequera: the same thing that we do with the face gate. We're going to do it with

3458
06:04:20.590 --> 06:04:37.990
Orlando Sequera: in agile. But at the end of each iteration Every 2 weeks. We're going to have a review, and and we're going to do exactly the same. We're gonna make this issue, can we? When I gather feedback from our from our stakeholders? We're gonna go over? Do we have to modify? Do we have to make adjustments?

3459
06:04:38.000 --> 06:04:42.100
Orlando Sequera: A. What can we do to improve value? It's about adding value right?

3460
06:04:42.400 --> 06:04:53.690
Orlando Sequera: But we do exactly the same thing, but we do it more often. We do it more often than we do it in predictive from we still follow the same approach, and we're going to continue

3461
06:04:53.820 --> 06:04:55.040
Orlando Sequera: until

3462
06:04:55.470 --> 06:04:56.579
Orlando Sequera: we meet.

3463
06:04:56.890 --> 06:05:07.180
Orlando Sequera: You might, you might be thinking so. It's agile, never ending. No, no, no, no! We're going to continue until we meet the acceptance criteria of the customer.

3464
06:05:08.040 --> 06:05:12.019
Orlando Sequera: and when the acceptance criterion definition of Don

3465
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:17.470
Orlando Sequera: of the customer is satisfied, or when the actual.

3466
06:05:17.600 --> 06:05:26.679
Orlando Sequera: the the actual project is completed. Usually we have in agile a ceiling for budget and a sailing for schedule.

3467
06:05:27.020 --> 06:05:40.700
Orlando Sequera: That's usually how it happens. But then the scope is what's really changing. The scope is not fixed. The scope is variable, but you usually have a a fixed duration and a fixed budget that that's how it's done.

3468
06:05:41.200 --> 06:05:42.180
Orlando Sequera: All right.

3469
06:05:44.040 --> 06:05:45.690
Orlando Sequera: A

3470
06:05:46.420 --> 06:06:00.310
Orlando Sequera: is adaptive tickle, typically found with tech project, not necessarily at the agile or adaptive is typically found also in marketing. It's widely used in marketing. They want to come up with a new marketing campaign to be more efficient, based on customer preferences.

3471
06:06:00.320 --> 06:06:10.089
Orlando Sequera: Marketing. They use agile left and right. So multiple industries you even find that in construction nowadays agile, is used in virtually every single industry out there

3472
06:06:10.500 --> 06:06:11.830
Orlando Sequera: A. Right. Now.

3473
06:06:13.040 --> 06:06:18.179
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And what about relationships between those project faces.

3474
06:06:18.670 --> 06:06:22.469
Orlando Sequera: faces? They can produce one or more deliverables.

3475
06:06:23.740 --> 06:06:24.990
Orlando Sequera: And

3476
06:06:25.040 --> 06:06:31.829
Orlando Sequera: usually and this is for predictive right? The outputs from one face or generally inputs to the next phase.

3477
06:06:32.220 --> 06:06:38.420
Orlando Sequera: and they can have sequential or overlapping relationships. So in phase one. Imagine. If we're building a house.

3478
06:06:38.650 --> 06:06:41.289
Orlando Sequera: we can

3479
06:06:41.420 --> 06:06:49.799
Orlando Sequera: we in phase one. We completed the structure, for example, phase 2. We can complete the roof and phase 3. We can complete the the

3480
06:06:49.990 --> 06:07:07.659
Orlando Sequera: the the landscaping. We can define that, and we're gonna it so we can group it that way. It's a sequential grouping, logical following a following logical relationship, so we can be as efficient as possible without resources. So that's why we use

3481
06:07:07.680 --> 06:07:18.019
Orlando Sequera: Project face relationship. We want to be as efficient as possible with the way it we use our resources. Okay, and that's what we get from these project faces relationships

3482
06:07:19.420 --> 06:07:20.670
Orlando Sequera: in this case.

3483
06:07:21.180 --> 06:07:31.950
Orlando Sequera: this specific graphic here. What we're showing is the face one and face 2 are sequential. We have to complete face one. Then we have a review or face gate, and then we start working on face 2, but

3484
06:07:32.230 --> 06:07:35.070
Orlando Sequera: phase 3 and phase 2 are overlapping.

3485
06:07:35.340 --> 06:07:39.420
Orlando Sequera: and that can perfectly happen. This

3486
06:07:39.750 --> 06:07:49.770
Orlando Sequera: a it. It. It works in some cases we gotta take a look at the the activities that work that we are working on, but it is

3487
06:07:49.920 --> 06:07:56.510
Orlando Sequera: perfectly done. It changes from project to project. But you can have sequential relationships or overlapping relationships.

3488
06:07:57.750 --> 06:08:02.999
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to applying a governance to predict the project faces.

3489
06:08:03.890 --> 06:08:07.499
Orlando Sequera: and going back to that example, with the shop industries

3490
06:08:08.330 --> 06:08:09.600
Orlando Sequera: we have to

3491
06:08:09.740 --> 06:08:19.270
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of each phase we have to validate project assumptions. We assume that supplier a was going to deliver on time. Is that still the case, or are they

3492
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:22.450
Orlando Sequera: in a different posture? Right now?

3493
06:08:22.540 --> 06:08:24.639
Orlando Sequera: We gotta take a look at risks.

3494
06:08:24.730 --> 06:08:32.300
Orlando Sequera: and we have to be able to provide a detailed explanation of the deliverables that we're going to produce with our with our faces

3495
06:08:32.330 --> 06:08:36.859
Orlando Sequera: at the end. We're gonna look at what we produce with our work in that phase.

3496
06:08:37.240 --> 06:08:44.560
Orlando Sequera: and we have to review, make sure that those deliverables that were produced are completed and are accepted

3497
06:08:44.700 --> 06:08:51.720
Orlando Sequera: in many cases. In many cases this goes back to some of the questions that some of you have about project Termination.

3498
06:08:51.820 --> 06:08:55.100
Orlando Sequera: If they are huge risks that are encountered

3499
06:08:55.320 --> 06:08:56.010
Orlando Sequera: at

3500
06:08:56.040 --> 06:09:12.670
Orlando Sequera: those face gates the decision can be made a of, terminated the project. That's one way of closing a project right? It's not the preferred way, but it's one way to close the project, but we always close projects Whether it is by completing what we said that we were going to do, and delivering

3501
06:09:12.820 --> 06:09:17.230
Orlando Sequera: a at the end of the project, or by project termination that might happen

3502
06:09:17.540 --> 06:09:20.110
Orlando Sequera: if the deliverables are no longer needed.

3503
06:09:20.170 --> 06:09:21.210
Orlando Sequera: We were

3504
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:40.620
Orlando Sequera: coming up with a service associated with a particular reg reg regulation. But now that regulation change so, therefore, there's no longer a a need for our service or our project that's termination. Usually what happens or in. Let's assume for a minute that we're trying to develop a new

3505
06:09:40.750 --> 06:09:50.199
Orlando Sequera: applicant tracking system for the Human Resources Department of an organization and all of a sudden we were acquired by a larger organization

3506
06:09:50.930 --> 06:10:03.340
Orlando Sequera: that already has an applicant tracking system in place. Therefore there's no longer a need for our project. So that's what projects are always close, whether it is by termination or by completing the scope of the product.

3507
06:10:04.030 --> 06:10:04.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

3508
06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:25.869
Orlando Sequera: this is what we covered. We talked about governance, we learned that we need to determine the appropriate governance for a project, and we also talked about escalation paths and thresholds key aspect here authority. You need to understand the organizational structure, the type of organization that you're working with.

3509
06:10:25.880 --> 06:10:33.939
Orlando Sequera: So you can answer that properly. Understand? Can it do I have to escalate, or can I solve it internally with the team?

3510
06:10:34.720 --> 06:10:38.900
Orlando Sequera: And the last topic that we have for today is

3511
06:10:39.120 --> 06:10:40.740
Orlando Sequera: Project compliance.

3512
06:10:42.410 --> 06:10:46.399
Orlando Sequera: We talked about governance. Now we're going to talk about for the compliance.

3513
06:10:47.290 --> 06:10:54.500
Orlando Sequera: This is a type of requirement that we have in our project, and is a crucial, crucial crucial topic.

3514
06:10:55.670 --> 06:10:57.180
Orlando Sequera: We need to understand.

3515
06:10:58.910 --> 06:11:00.730
Orlando Sequera: This goes back to.

3516
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:07.090
Orlando Sequera: And in this case, yes, this has impacts associated with

3517
06:11:07.200 --> 06:11:11.599
Orlando Sequera: a enterprise. Environmental factors like government regulations. That's an if

3518
06:11:11.710 --> 06:11:20.770
Orlando Sequera: corporate policies. That would be an opa. So this touches both. But these are requirements that we have to meet to be compliant. Okay.

3519
06:11:20.800 --> 06:11:23.400
Orlando Sequera: it might also be related to

3520
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:27.289
Orlando Sequera: in this might be tied up to a Pmo. If it's in place.

3521
06:11:27.460 --> 06:11:33.809
Orlando Sequera: and these are special special type of requirements that we have to meet in our projects.

3522
06:11:34.100 --> 06:11:37.380
Orlando Sequera: Project team is gonna be responsible for

3523
06:11:37.780 --> 06:11:40.520
Orlando Sequera: a compliance related activities.

3524
06:11:40.620 --> 06:11:42.829
Orlando Sequera: And this has an impact on

3525
06:11:43.040 --> 06:12:00.179
Orlando Sequera: procurement multiple areas of your project and also on quality. This is a type of requirement that we have to make sure this can be a make or break aspect of your project. You have to be compliant. We need to understand the impacts of non compliance, compliance, requirements.

3526
06:12:00.240 --> 06:12:01.180
Orlando Sequera: Kim

3527
06:12:01.610 --> 06:12:02.700
Orlando Sequera: drive.

3528
06:12:03.820 --> 06:12:18.759
Orlando Sequera: It can be associated to legal constraints. This is about requirements for specific practices, standards, privacy, loss, for example, health care, pay, protecting patient information, hepa in the Us.

3529
06:12:18.800 --> 06:12:23.369
Orlando Sequera: Or or in the in Europe for

3530
06:12:23.460 --> 06:12:35.810
Orlando Sequera: information protecting information, things. Gdpr: if i'm not mistaken for those of you that are in Europe. So that might have an impact on your project. If you are a if your project is.

3531
06:12:35.860 --> 06:12:41.379
Orlando Sequera: it has a name. It's gonna be impacted by those legislation. We need to be compliant with them.

3532
06:12:41.400 --> 06:12:50.729
Orlando Sequera: or how we handle sensitive information right for those of you that have worked with the government. You know exactly what I'm talking about. These can make or break your project. So

3533
06:12:51.120 --> 06:13:01.609
Orlando Sequera: how much process, rigor and quality control is for them. It depends on the product. It depends on the industry. That's why we need to understand the different enterprise, environmental factors and organizational process assets.

3534
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:03.899
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to

3535
06:13:04.520 --> 06:13:05.580
Orlando Sequera: your

3536
06:13:06.280 --> 06:13:10.809
Orlando Sequera: compliance we have multiple categories. We have environmental risks.

3537
06:13:11.190 --> 06:13:23.230
Orlando Sequera: workplace, health and safety, social responsibility. We have quality. We have process risks these changes from industry to industry and it. But it is important for you to know about it

3538
06:13:24.820 --> 06:13:25.570
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3539
06:13:25.770 --> 06:13:27.809
Orlando Sequera: And, by the way, we have been.

3540
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:30.300
Orlando Sequera: We have a link to our

3541
06:13:30.660 --> 06:13:31.790
Orlando Sequera: survey.

3542
06:13:31.830 --> 06:13:34.050
Orlando Sequera: Please fill out the survey before

3543
06:13:34.140 --> 06:13:36.110
Orlando Sequera: you leave the session today.

3544
06:13:36.240 --> 06:13:41.699
Orlando Sequera: That is going to help us to make the adjustments that we need to make to provide you with a better experience.

3545
06:13:42.320 --> 06:13:48.840
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to compliance risks we have to investigate and understand who handles the compliance.

3546
06:13:48.880 --> 06:14:08.030
Orlando Sequera: What is the organizations quality policy? We, that's why we need to understand which opa's are applicable. That's an opa, by the way, and we also need to understand how these regulatory requirements impact the organization. We gotta understand the impact. And again, this can make or break your project.

3547
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:09.410
Orlando Sequera: And also

3548
06:14:09.770 --> 06:14:20.069
Orlando Sequera: are the team members aware of compliance matters. So we do get to do a little bit of the detective work to understand that this is extremely important. This is a type of

3549
06:14:20.130 --> 06:14:24.029
