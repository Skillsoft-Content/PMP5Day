We are going to cover some very important housekeeping items and need everyone’s full attention. If you have a technical issue, please begin your message with “Percipio:” if you are a Percipio user and “Non-Percipio:” if you are a non-Percipio user. Please hold on to your questions until after we have finished the house keeping items.

01:29:58	Jose Pacheco:	What are the three Matrix authorities again?
01:32:58	Teisha Akinpelu:	I’m struggling with the difference between GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE. Would you agree with this: Governance sets the tone for the entire company’s attitude to risk, ethics, and business practices. Compliance embodies that attitude in relation to specific laws and regulations.
01:36:24	Wyatt Pierce:	@Teisha, I think of governanance as an internal set of rules/processes for spending and other things. E.g., VP is authorized to sign off on up to $2m; or projects over $xx require review by some group of people. I think of compliance as mostly external to the organization (although there can be internal compliance constructs as well).
01:37:31	Renatta Foston:	Name test. I did not conduct this action yesterday.

02:22:22	Ricardo Sanabria:	Does the PMP test focus ? on stakeholders in terms as of being a active participants of the program or as the ones being impacted by the end-state of the project itself. 
02:22:28	Marco Egizi:	In the europoean highway example, you wouldn't engage the American travelers as much as you would the European residents.
02:22:37	Azizza Brown:	I agree with mary clement

02:22:41	Ezekiel Ross:	Is identifying the key stakeholders a guessing game?
02:23:13	Daniel Cusinato:	I had difficulty this morning and missed the first hour of class.  I understand that I must make this up and track once the recorded version comes out.  Am I missing anything above?
02:24:06	Christele Dudok:	stekaholder register is required either for traditional or agile?
02:24:15	Matthew Roberts:	just click on "chat" and the feed will go away
02:24:25	Jeremy Johnson:	I have the same two questions as well.
02:24:25	Oyun:	What does Stakeholder register is public mean? Can PM share or post public?
02:24:35	William Mitchell:	In the European Example: Consider the European Tourism/Commerce associations that would know tourism travel patters/concerns - they will know where tour companies believe additional capacity is needed to support tourism.
02:25:15	Andrew Warninghoff:	are their controls on the stakeholder info? 
02:25:56	Kristy Guede:	For some projects, you want a sample pool of stakeholders not just the closets people to it right?
02:26:20	Tanya Gaines:	So,  is It who is requesting the project and funding it as the key stakeholders??
02:26:20	William Mitchell:	In the European Example: Consider the European Tourism/Commerce associations that would know tourism travel patters/concerns - they will know where tour companies believe additional capacity is needed to support tourism.
02:26:54	null:	In Risk and mitigation document do we need to mention risk associated with Stakeholders change  or stakeholder  register impact is sufficient?  
02:26:54	Ahmed Ali:	What if your organization have Global, Regional and National PMO, where policies are driven by Global Level - Do Stakeholders Change?
02:27:36	Ambra Robinson:	Smartsheet is a great App to create a stakeholder registry
02:27:57	Carlos Perez-Islas:	Would tenants be labeled as customers?
02:27:57	Teisha Akinpelu:	“Resistor” lol
02:28:26	Oyun:	Can stakeholder register shared outside of project or organization?
02:28:26	Yalla Bhanusri:	what is the difference between 'major requirements' & 'expectations'
02:28:45	Alice Delp:	is this chart related to specific industry?
02:28:56	Haitham Hesham:	I also suggest adding to the stakeholder register list the maintenance and operation group as the they will be responsible to maintain this project/asset when complete
02:29:08	Lakia Henry:	Define a resistor? You can resist and still be internal? 
02:29:15	Carlos Perez-Islas:	Would protesters fall into the stakeholder register?
02:29:16	Alice Delp:	will this chart be outlined differently depending on industry or will it have the same titles? 
02:29:21	Mark Thompson:	who would you allow to see this document given you have Influence attitude on it
02:29:21	Manish Bansiwala:	Ok
02:29:30	Justin Aiken:	Is influence/attitude a good idea to put out there?
02:29:31	Alice Delp:	ok. i understand
02:29:31	William Mitchell:	In some situations, you may want to consider environmental/historical organizations that may be opposed/vested in the project.
02:29:45	Manish Bansiwala:	Resister
02:29:48	Benjamin Giovingo:	A resistor is part of an electrical circuit; a person who resists something is a “resister.”
02:29:54	Alice Delp:	 is this time constraints on this chart?
02:30:06	Jean-Luc Kersulec:	If you design someone as a resistor in the register, will it be taken well?
02:30:15	Alice Delp:	or is this a standing roaster for lifecycle of project?
02:30:18	Marco Egizi:	It's like the PM equivalent of a CRM for sales.
02:30:19	Andrew Warninghoff:	are these categories on the register that are required?
02:30:50	Cesar Centeno Lopez:	does exist a 3d stakehoder register?
02:31:22	Cesar Centeno Lopez:	stakeholder register I meant
02:31:25	Zain Safdar Ali:	What are champions, resistor & neutral? how do we know/rate attitude/influence in stakeholder sheet?
02:31:42	Li Yuan:	How is influence / attitude defined? 
02:31:59	John Variakojis:	If PM aims to be communicative and transparent, sharing a stakeholder register could be counterproductive, i.e. a stakeholder could negatively view being labeled a 'resistor'.  
02:32:02	Amanda Henning:	I took a practice exam last night and kept getting the answer wrong for when to reference the stakeholder engagement plan VS communication management plan. Is there a way to differentiate?
02:32:45	Dell Fletcher:	That is interesting you would add a "detractor" to the stakeholder registry
02:32:53	Johnny Workman:	what would be an example of the level of interest? 
02:33:22	Benjamin Giovingo:	perhaps keep the influence/attitude column private
02:34:04	mary clement:	resisters and detractors are still stakeholders. they are affected by the project. Think about the project as a new software app for tracking employee time. people might be against the project - but they are still internal employees who will be affected by it.
02:34:22	Dell Fletcher:	I think an example of a detractor may be an external stakeholder that has a small business that neighbors the building you may be proposing to build and are resistance against the builiding being built due to potential risk of them losing customers.
02:34:52	Marco Egizi:	Good call, Dell!
02:35:08	Hanna Pardee:	Plus knowing their attitude/influence impacts type of comms to send to those stakeholders - negative feedback is as good as positive 
02:35:25	Haitham Hesham:	This can be done and communicated through community engagements
02:35:33	Hanna Pardee:	this way you can address those concerns the "resistors" have
02:35:37	Dell Fletcher:	Or simple example. Environmental activist "tree huggers" that don't want trees or certain areas to be damaged or removed that may delay the project from moving forward.

03:31:37	Benjamin Techmeier:	@Adam, they said you can apply for it after the bootcamp is over
03:31:54	Ajaysingh Dehariya:	Timezones
03:31:56	mary clement:	Adam - I saw a document that said we would get a voucher at the same time we got the voucher for the exam - after completing the course requirements.
03:32:03	Zachary Johnson:	Adam (AH) - I emailed my sponsor today, they said it would take 24-48 hours for them to get back to us. I remember from the 12 Jan ZOOM - they said you requested the Learner's kit through the advisor
03:32:04	Jeremy Cottrell:	Tanangachi, probably depends on the organization. Example being if you are dealing with sensitive or classified information.
03:32:05	Rahul Ramanan:	I am fully confused on how attendance work here - there is no clear instructions on how to do it.. if someone can show an example that will be great. do we need to track it manually?
03:32:12	Benjamin Techmeier:	@Adam, they said you can apply for it after the boot camp is over
03:32:25	Adam Heathman:	Ohhh that makes sense. Ok, thank you guys!
03:32:44	Katelynn Quinn:	Anyone still have the zoom link?
03:32:49	Elaine Johnson:	From my O2O POC: The Instructor will also mention multiple times purchase the ‘Learner Kit’. Your learner kit is for the PMP certification exam. Once you pass the practice exams/Test Prep, your PMI Application is accepted and we make your PMP certification exam payment, you will receive the Learner Kit.  Everything you need for PMP will be provided by O2O.
03:33:08	Jeremy Cottrell:	Tanangachi, probably depends on the organization. Example being if you are dealing with sensitive or classified information.
03:33:35	Adam Heathman:	Thank you Elaine!! All of that was super helpful :).

03:34:51	House:	Neither do I in ref to the attendance tracker
03:34:51	Lawton Hill:	Kind of lame that O2O doesn't set you up with the Learner Kit prior to starting the Bootcamp.  Would be nice to follow along with the Student Workbook.
03:34:54	Melanie Ivey-Bunnell:	@Rahul, at the very top there is a GitHub link that has the attendance tracker. only input log ins and outs from what I understand. no need to document class breaks.
03:35:10	Alice Delp:	should also be learned when you start your job. thank you for mentioning this example. 
03:35:16	Adam Heathman:	You just use the fields on the document to log when you joined, how you joined, when you left and why, then submit later when the bootcamp is over.
03:35:16	Tracey Brown:	can anyone help me get the percipio Attendance tracker not just the video talking about the tracker but the actual tracker?
03:35:17	Cathe Alao:	@ Eliane Johnson, is that also applicable to Percipio students?
03:35:58	Seth Harrison:	@lawton, you should be able to download each session's slide deck off the resources tab in Precipio
03:36:14	Jennifer Johnson:	@cathie If you download the tracker, there are detailed directions on how to fill it out toward the bottom of the document. You need to document each day, regardless of how you log on to the class.  If you stay on the session ALL day, you will only have 1 entry per day. 
03:37:29	House:	I will try it again but its not allowing me
03:38:08	Cathe Alao:	Thanks Jennifer
03:38:09	Lawton Hill:	@seth I've got the slides.  There's a separate "Student Workbook" embedded in the PMI Learner Kit that is referenced in slide 13.
03:38:10	Jeremy Johnson:	Have you ever had an experience where stakeholders perceived you were "overcommunicating"?
03:38:31	Tracey Brown:	can anyone help me find the actual attendance tracker in percipio? not just the video but the tracker itself sorry im 55 not very computer savy i need help 
03:38:56	Melanie Ivey-Bunnell:	@tracey https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5Day
03:39:21	Nathan Trotter:	@Jeremy are you overcommunicating or mainly forwarding all emails or replying all for all emails without filtering them? The latter would be pretty annoying.
03:39:28	Elaine Johnson:	@Cath Alao - I can only answer as an O2O student.  These are the details provided by my POC.

03:55:51	Erica Vander Voort:	Could we time box questions? We only have 30 minutes to break and we have a lot of content to cover. 
03:57:36	Jeremy Cottrell:	A Chiefs Mess on a ship is a perfect example of this :D
03:57:55	Johnny Workman:	 Here is what I'm tracking. I was notified I'm the PM, and the first step is to get a sense of the business environment. I ask about how my organization's policies and processes affect my project. Then I start to figure out my stakeholders and assess their impact on my project using one of the processes we just used. Is this the right thought process so far?
