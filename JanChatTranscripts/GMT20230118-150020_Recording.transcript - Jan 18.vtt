00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:22.189
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to hey? That's a that's a common question as well.

130
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.560
Orlando Sequera: I attended all 5 sessions. I would like to get

131
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:38.350
Orlando Sequera: access to the replace. Do I have any limitations? No, the answer is, No, there's no limit on the question that replace for study purposes. Okay, these are going to be available to you

132
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.280
Orlando Sequera: all right.

133
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.560
Orlando Sequera: Now.

134
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.839
Orlando Sequera: We are gonna go over a recap of what we cover yesterday

135
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.650
Orlando Sequera: that we started

136
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.770
Orlando Sequera: yesterday talking

137
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:03.020
Orlando Sequera: about planning. We started talking about stakeholders, and this is something

138
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.809
Orlando Sequera: that happens at the very beginning of any project. Hey? We started talking about

139
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.330
Orlando Sequera: identifying the stakeholders that it is very important

140
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.919
Orlando Sequera: that you identified your stakeholders.

141
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.889
Orlando Sequera: You need to know who they are.

142
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:25.569
Orlando Sequera: That is something that happens at the very beginning of every single project as I was mentioning before, and i'll mention it later. It was a topic that we cover at the end with

143
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.060
Orlando Sequera: with planning.

144
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.099
Orlando Sequera: We do. The 2 things that happen at the start of any project

145
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.480
Orlando Sequera: are

146
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:45.169
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder notification that should happen. Actually, you should identify your stakeholders voting parallel. You should also be working and making sure that the project charter. That important

147
00:14:45.360 --> 00:15:00.309
Orlando Sequera: artifact that is the birth certificate of your project is also develop. You're going to be working with the sponsor. The sponsor is in charge of making sure that the the document gets created. But you can provide assistance

148
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:06.859
Orlando Sequera: to the sponsor. But those 2 processes they happen in parallel. Okay.

149
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:20.469
Orlando Sequera: So it's not all way, not everything is going to be sequential. That's the point that i'm trying to make. But that happens first. If you would like to know what will. What happens first at the very beginning of the project is those 2 things.

150
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.670
Orlando Sequera: stakeholder identification

151
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:35.190
Orlando Sequera: and developing a plan to keep your stakeholders engage. That is crucial to me to know, because at the end of the day we are building our product service a result, whatever it is that we're trying to do with our project.

152
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.789
Orlando Sequera: whether it is building a house or developing a software for

153
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.729
Orlando Sequera: the accounting department.

154
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:53.749
Orlando Sequera: Whatever a project is, these 4 customers, right? So we need to start knowing who the stakeholders are. Not All of them are going to be the customers, for we need to know all the stakeholders. So that's

155
00:15:53.850 --> 00:16:00.870
Orlando Sequera: that happens at the very beginning of any project, and also that important artifact, the first.

156
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:17.570
Orlando Sequera: the the first important artifact in our project, which is the birth certificate also known as the project charter. That has to be that that is the green light that you need as a project manager to start working on planning. Okay.

157
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:31.349
Orlando Sequera: without that, the project doesn't officially start or exist without the product. Charter the project doesn't officially exist, and, as I mentioned before, multiple times, and I want to mention it one more time.

158
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.849
Orlando Sequera: Think of the the project, Charter.

159
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:46.450
Orlando Sequera: at that particular point in time, at the very beginning of your project, with the information that you know, based on what will, based on

160
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.400
Orlando Sequera: organizational process assets.

161
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.160
Orlando Sequera: enterprise, environmental factors.

162
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.019
Orlando Sequera: and also based on

163
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.799
Orlando Sequera: the business case, the justification, all those initial

164
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.189
Orlando Sequera: a documents that are creating

165
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:14.150
Orlando Sequera: in the genesis of a project. Okay, at the very beginning, before the project actually exist, there's that information put. Then it's all put together in that

166
00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:26.250
Orlando Sequera: in that artifact that we call the project charter. It's going to have information about multiple areas of our project. It has information about.

167
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:37.170
Orlando Sequera: They scheduled milestones, at least we because we haven't built the scheduled yet. Right? We're going to do that later in planning them Today we're going to be talking about that we're going to start.

168
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:51.710
Orlando Sequera: Doing a deeper dive in those multiple areas. We don't have a schedule at the at that point. So it's just. But we have some idea, some high level idea about the milestones. And, by the way, a mass times a significant event in any in any project.

169
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.690
Orlando Sequera: Then

170
00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:02.009
Orlando Sequera: it's going to have high level information about the scope, high level information about their budget, but not the actual budget. We still have to go through processes

171
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.600
Orlando Sequera: to determine

172
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.990
Orlando Sequera: the actual budget.

173
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:19.250
Orlando Sequera: Yeah, we haven't done that. But we have an idea. We have an idea based on historical information. We're gonna have some we need to start somewhere, and that somewhere is going to be the project Charter. So those are the main 2 things that happen at the very beginning.

174
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:25.419
Orlando Sequera: Going back to the stakeholders. We need to have a plan on how we need to know who those stakeholders are.

175
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:37.449
Orlando Sequera: and the outcome of that process of stakeholder. Identification is going to be another artifact that we call the stakeholder register. It's nothing but a spreadsheet.

176
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.260
Orlando Sequera: a list of stakeholders with contact information

177
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.290
Orlando Sequera: and as much information as we can collect about those stakeholders

178
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:53.190
Orlando Sequera: to understand who they are, their contact information, what are, if they have any? What is their

179
00:18:54.030 --> 00:19:12.479
Orlando Sequera: a? What is there? The the the requirements? When it comes to the project, we need to know that a. In advance so we can tailor. Our approach to keep them engaged is crucial for any project it's crucial to keep your stakeholders engaged regardless of the approach.

180
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.529
Orlando Sequera: It is crucial to keep your stakeholders engaged.

181
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.199
Orlando Sequera: So that is crucial. Okay? Then we talked about.

182
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:34.360
Orlando Sequera: We have that in place. We move forward, and we also said that we need to get everyone on the same page. That's what we mean by Bill share understanding. We need to get our

183
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.479
Orlando Sequera: team members, and we need to get our stakeholders

184
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.820
Orlando Sequera: on the same page

185
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.760
Orlando Sequera: in regards to their

186
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:52.410
Orlando Sequera: understanding of the project that is crucial that has to be done at the very beginning. Otherwise you're gonna have your project teams going in a different direction

187
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:58.720
Orlando Sequera: compared to what the stakeholders are expecting. So you have to align those suspect those expectations.

188
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:10.930
Orlando Sequera: That's where the vision comes into play. The project vision is clear is clear. We need to know where we're going. That is crucial that we have, and regardless of the approach, regardless of the approach

189
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:17.260
Orlando Sequera: it what? And by that I mean whether you're going with a predictive approach, whether you're going with a

190
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.999
Orlando Sequera: with an agile approach that is crucial.

191
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.160
Orlando Sequera: that we are on the same page.

192
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.410
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about forming the team.

193
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:43.410
Orlando Sequera: That is very important. And we briefly what a video the talkman ladder video about the 5 stages of the information. We will do a deeper dive on that. But anything regardless of the approach is going to go through those

194
00:20:43.420 --> 00:21:02.399
Orlando Sequera: a stages, and that's something that you need to know, and you need to remember for your Pmp. Exam. You might get questions on the talkman ladder, but we're gonna cover that. we we're also gonna be talking about that later. Okay. But the Tuckman ladder is an important topic.

195
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:08.249
Orlando Sequera: Then, forming the team. We have a different considerations.

196
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.259
Orlando Sequera: For if we're following a predictive approach, if we're following the imagine approach. If we're following an app.

197
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.669
Orlando Sequera: a hybrid approach that is important to

198
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.109
Orlando Sequera: it to keep in mind

199
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:37.540
Orlando Sequera: and different considerations. For a, for example, for a predictive. If we're following a predictive approach, we need to know the scope well. We need to work on understanding the requirements and understanding the scope before we can start working on the project. But

200
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.929
Orlando Sequera: when we forming the team, for if we're following a module approach.

201
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.299
Orlando Sequera: We need to know the vision. We need to know where we're going.

202
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.929
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to be

203
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.970
Orlando Sequera: building a new

204
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.160
Orlando Sequera: type of engine for

205
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:59.819
Orlando Sequera: space rockets to go to Mars and beyond using a new technology. Okay, we know where we're going. We have

206
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:10.939
Orlando Sequera: a we're able to to determine the vision where we're going. How do we get there? That's a different story. So the scope is going to be changing, and we are using an adaptive approach

207
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.220
Orlando Sequera: to develop.

208
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:29.559
Orlando Sequera: at least for the development phase of that project. We're going to be using an adaptive approach, and that's going to be your best bet, because we're going to have to change course, change, change course multiple times throughout the project. But we form the team, if regardless of the approach with some different considerations.

209
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.070
Orlando Sequera: and then that takes us to the project approach?

210
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:41.230
Orlando Sequera: Should we go with a predictive approach? Should we go with an agile approach or adaptive approach? Or

211
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:49.110
Orlando Sequera: should we go with a hybrid approach with a combination of the 2? Mainly, this is gonna come from

212
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.300
Orlando Sequera: mainly. This is gonna come from your

213
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.830
Orlando Sequera: from the subject matter experts, the people that are doing the work, your project team members.

214
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.699
Orlando Sequera: they shouldn't, be imposed.

215
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:11.419
Orlando Sequera: Everything is done through collaboration. Everything should be done through collaboration not not imposed. Let them drive. Let them drive.

216
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:20.209
Orlando Sequera: Remember the important concept of servant leadership. Okay. So this should be a team decision ideally.

217
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.380
Orlando Sequera: and

218
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.560
Orlando Sequera: which

219
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:33.470
Orlando Sequera: which approach is the best fit for our particular situation. And then we started also briefly, at the very end of our session yesterday to talk about

220
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.640
Orlando Sequera: planning

221
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:43.169
Orlando Sequera: that once we get everyone started we completed that kickoff meeting. We got everyone on board we got. We were able to get

222
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.900
Orlando Sequera: our stakeholders and our team members on the same on the same page.

223
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.250
Orlando Sequera: We

224
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.080
Orlando Sequera: also have a

225
00:23:53.170 --> 00:24:08.950
Orlando Sequera: approach are in place. We had our kickoff meeting now. It's time to move on to start working on planning. And that is lesson number 3. And that involves a deeper dive in multiple areas of your project.

226
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.890
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we're going to start covering those multiple areas. Now, we we're going to

227
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:22.830
Orlando Sequera: understand properly what I said yesterday about the project charter, because now we're gonna have to work on

228
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.840
Orlando Sequera: defining the scope. How do we do that for predicted projects and adaptive projects?

229
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:34.020
Orlando Sequera: Then we're going to move on to another important area schedule. We have to work on

230
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:45.410
Orlando Sequera: creating the schedule for a project. Now we do. We're gonna do a deeper dive. We're gonna we're gonna put some effort to understand now now that we know this code of our project. We're gonna work on

231
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:51.320
Orlando Sequera: defining the schedule for a project. So that takes time, and we have to do that with the team.

232
00:24:52.020 --> 00:25:04.910
Orlando Sequera: Now we have enough information to work with our team members to build our schedule, and it's gonna it has to be as realistic as possible. We also have to cover a another important area which is resources.

233
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:21.459
Orlando Sequera: It takes planning and all. We also have to work at least tied up to a the scope and the schedule. And another important that we're going to be covering today is budget right? So we have our scope defined. If it's, if it's a predictive approach.

234
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:44.469
Orlando Sequera: We have our schedule. We have a resources. We also have to work on our budget. Now, we're gonna we're gonna be doing deeper dives. And this is the the reason why you don't have to go back and change your project, Charter. That's high level information that you had at that particular time. The main purpose of that project, Charter, is to give you the green light, for now you have

235
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.810
Orlando Sequera: the green light to start working on these planning processes and define

236
00:25:48.990 --> 00:26:05.420
Orlando Sequera: do a deeper dive with your team members, with your stakeholders. To start. Define this different areas of your project. You need you need it. It's going to take some time, and you need you need information. It's nice. High level is not going to cut it, so that's why you'd have to go back and change

237
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.650
Orlando Sequera: your

238
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:14.250
Orlando Sequera: project. Charter. So this is what we have in store. We're gonna cover today. Scope, schedule resources

239
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:25.150
Orlando Sequera: and budget. There's a lot of content here. So even though it's only 4 areas, there's a lot of content that is gonna keep us entertained for the remainder of this session. All right?

240
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.350
Orlando Sequera: Okay, I

241
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.009
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna get started.

242
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:43.050
Orlando Sequera: But before we get into the content I would like to review any of the content related questions briefly, and then we're gonna start.

243
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.330
Orlando Sequera: and we're going to continue.

244
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.360
Orlando Sequera: If I see any question that is,

245
00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:56.800
Orlando Sequera: initially.

246
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.869
Orlando Sequera: okay, there is a question.

247
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.800
Orlando Sequera: You mentioned that there being 2 needed things

248
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.150
Orlando Sequera: before the project starts. Nope. No, no, no, no.

249
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:34.879
Orlando Sequera: they have to this is what happens at the start of any project. The project charter is to official birth certificate. But at the same time that we're developing the project Charter, we're also identifying stakeholders. Those are the 2 processes that occur at the start of the project. Okay.

250
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.149
Orlando Sequera: when you're working on identifying your stakeholders.

251
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:45.909
Orlando Sequera: you have to come up with a plan. Yes, you have to come up with a plan to my apologies. I didn't agree

252
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.460
Orlando Sequera: the question correctly.

253
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:55.789
Orlando Sequera: but you have to. But the planning happens after the steak after the pro charter is created. You start working on planning efforts, but

254
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.620
Orlando Sequera: not just for stakeholder for all these different areas that we have

255
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:06.520
Orlando Sequera: that we have here. Okay, all the different areas of your project, scope, scheduled resources, project, risk.

256
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.250
Orlando Sequera: quality and integration.

257
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.410
Orlando Sequera: So all that happens

258
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:15.320
Orlando Sequera: once the Project charter has been created and signed off.

259
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.470
Orlando Sequera: All right.

260
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:26.089
Orlando Sequera: me. So i'm trying to find any other content. Related questions.

261
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.910
Orlando Sequera: Okay, Adams.

262
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.449
Orlando Sequera: I don't see any other

263
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:52.549
Orlando Sequera: content related questions at this point. But we will go back to them. All right. So let's get started. We're gonna start with planning lesson 3 planning. This is

264
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.609
Orlando Sequera: we are working with the team, and this is where you

265
00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.930
Orlando Sequera: are going to

266
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:07.639
Orlando Sequera: so the project started, and now we have to work on our planning efforts, and we're going to start with scope.

267
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.300
Orlando Sequera: This is

268
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.719
Orlando Sequera: one of the most important, I would say this is the foundation of

269
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.160
Orlando Sequera: any project.

270
00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.020
Orlando Sequera: Scope is king.

271
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.200
Orlando Sequera: Scope is

272
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.909
Orlando Sequera: probably the most important

273
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.390
Orlando Sequera: a area of any project.

274
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.259
Orlando Sequera: Everything is everything else that we built

275
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.340
Orlando Sequera: in our project. It's going to be around the scope.

276
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.140
Orlando Sequera: If we don't get this right.

277
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.750
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be in trouble.

278
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.480
Orlando Sequera: This is the foundation of

279
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.889
Orlando Sequera: any project, any project. So we start

280
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.299
Orlando Sequera: a in product management with the scope what we're gonna be doing.

281
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.959
Orlando Sequera: and when it comes to scope

282
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.580
Orlando Sequera: what I

283
00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.829
Orlando Sequera: The scope

284
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:11.199
Orlando Sequera: project scope is is going to be the sum of all the product, services and results that are going to be provided as a project. But let's get a clear understanding, because again, we have

285
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.990
Orlando Sequera: projects, cope.

286
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.410
Orlando Sequera: and we have

287
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.650
Orlando Sequera: product scope. Let's understand it is important.

288
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:26.190
Orlando Sequera: It it is important that we understand the differences between project, scope and product scope. I'm. Going to start with product scope.

289
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.419
Orlando Sequera: or we're going to start with project scope. My apologies

290
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.230
Orlando Sequera: project scope

291
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.059
Orlando Sequera: if they work that we have to complete

292
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.159
Orlando Sequera: in our project

293
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.230
Orlando Sequera: to produce

294
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.130
Orlando Sequera: a product service of result

295
00:30:44.530 --> 00:31:00.749
Orlando Sequera: in the example that we're using in the content. The project scope of the shop lifestyle center is to complete a construction project and engage a sales and marketing firm to fill it with tenants over time to complete a construction project.

296
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.040
Orlando Sequera: That is.

297
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.320
Orlando Sequera: they work that we have to do to produce that

298
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.650
Orlando Sequera: not to produce, to build the lifestyle center.

299
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.830
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that is project scope, this specific case.

300
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.170
Orlando Sequera: then the product scope

301
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.019
Orlando Sequera: is about functionality.

302
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.340
Orlando Sequera: Protocol is about features and functionality

303
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.460
Orlando Sequera: that

304
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.179
Orlando Sequera: a product service over. So

305
00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:41.319
Orlando Sequera: it's gonna have a sab it it. Think of your iphone, for example. Think of your Android phone the memory. They will. They call her they

306
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:46.160
Orlando Sequera: the actual, the processor speed, right?

307
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.470
Orlando Sequera: So those are

308
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.629
Orlando Sequera: functional characteristics. That's what we mean by

309
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.160
Orlando Sequera: product scope.

310
00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:13.000
Orlando Sequera: Project scope is the work that we have to complete to produce that product scope. Some are all of it right? No, necessarily all of it. It might be some areas of the product. Remember, when we, when we talked about the product life cycle yesterday and the project life cycle yesterday. Okay.

311
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.809
Orlando Sequera: So

312
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:28.190
Orlando Sequera: in the example of the shop industries lifestyle center, it's going to be the complete re rewrite tailization of the oasis Down with customer spaces for commercial and community tenants.

313
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:33.090
Orlando Sequera: It's about functionality, functionality for a

314
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:40.339
Orlando Sequera: that, for o a system for this, Imaginary location? Okay, that's product scope.

315
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.009
Orlando Sequera: But the scope can be

316
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.970
Orlando Sequera: for an idea. This has to be identified at the beginning, and

317
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.770
Orlando Sequera: the scope can be fixed.

318
00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:16.970
Orlando Sequera: and usually that's what happens in construction projects. This scope is fixed, or and there are some other projects, too, not only construction, but is the easiest way to visualize it right When we're building we're building a one story house, for example, the scope is going to be fixed. We're going to define it. We to understand one story house. But we need to understand. Okay, what type of roof

319
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:25.450
Orlando Sequera: are you gonna be? You and you're using metal roof are you using shingles? What are you? What are you using for the roof? What type of

320
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:40.850
Orlando Sequera: exterior W. What type of materials are you using for the frame of the house? Are you using concrete? Are you using what we are using for the exterior of the house? What about the floors. Are they going to be tile? Are they going to be carpet?

321
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:49.319
Orlando Sequera: What about the the landscaping of the house? So we need to define all of that we need to define all of that. That's how

322
00:33:49.380 --> 00:34:02.670
Orlando Sequera: in If we're following a predictive approach, we need to define all those requirements before we start doing the work. The scope is fixed. You might be wondering. Can that change?

323
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:11.020
Orlando Sequera: And the answer is yes. But in that specific case we need to go. We need to keep those changes under control.

324
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:31.400
Orlando Sequera: and for that we use a change control process. Okay, yes, change change can happen, but it has to be controlled. If the scope is fixed, we have to go through a change control process. Okay. Otherwise imagine the. Except with the example of the house, you have your

325
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:38.480
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume that your customers they want to build. They want to add a pool to the house. Okay.

326
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.319
Orlando Sequera: that's fine. We we add in a pool. Is it? Okay? But

327
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:51.189
Orlando Sequera: this is gonna have an impact to the the scope. It was already fixed. And a proof you want to add a pool. That's a change.

328
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:58.289
Orlando Sequera: The pool is going to cost $40,000, Us. Dollars, and it's gonna add

329
00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.000
Orlando Sequera: 3 months to the schedule. So

330
00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:06.140
Orlando Sequera: an entity that we call change Control Board is going to review them and say, okay.

331
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.859
Orlando Sequera: this is gonna add

332
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.090
Orlando Sequera: to the schedule

333
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.369
Orlando Sequera: 3 months, and it's gonna cost $40,000 more

334
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:25.609
Orlando Sequera: that gets presented to the customers. Are you okay with this? Yes, let's do it. We are okay with that we're okay with extending the schedule and increasing the budget. Okay? And then the pool gets it's gonna get built.

335
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.080
Orlando Sequera: But would you might be wondering, Why can you use an agent approach

336
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.899
Orlando Sequera: in building building the pool, because when you start.

337
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.720
Orlando Sequera: dig in the hole in the backyard, for example, for the pool

338
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.749
Orlando Sequera: 2 weeks later, once the

339
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:46.209
Orlando Sequera: the the the whole is the the police dog.

340
00:35:47.450 --> 00:36:05.809
Orlando Sequera: They it's not a good approach to be. Well, you know what I don't like that location. I like that other location. Then you start digging another hole in the backyard. You start a 2 weeks later. No, you know you know what we change our mind. We won the pool. Not in this location. We went in that location. So, for in those situations

341
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.219
Orlando Sequera: an adaptive approach it

342
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:18.579
Orlando Sequera: changing, that is really having the scope a flexible like that. It's not really going to be conducive to a better result. That's going to be a major impact. It's gonna

343
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:28.849
Orlando Sequera: It's going to be traumatic for that project. So that's why in those situations it's better to go with a fit. You need to define your scope really well, and

344
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:39.790
Orlando Sequera: can it change? Yes, but it has to be control. It has to be. That's why we use a change control process, and we go through those approvals. But in some situations

345
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.010
Orlando Sequera: the scope.

346
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.139
Orlando Sequera: It's better if we have. If we follow a flexible approach

347
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.359
Orlando Sequera: A. We need.

348
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:53.310
Orlando Sequera: for example, this happens in, and we're not using here the actual

349
00:36:53.430 --> 00:37:07.380
Orlando Sequera: a example of software development for agile right in marketing. This happens a lot, and also in sales based on customer preferences. Why is that? Because, as you know customer preferences are changing

350
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:20.030
Orlando Sequera: daily or actually hourly. You could say that customer versions are changing, so that indicates a lot of changes if you have. So if in that situation you know

351
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:37.090
Orlando Sequera: that your scope you're working in a sales project or a marketing project based on customer preferences that are going to be changing, having a rigid approach with a fixed cope. Is that going to be the best bet for your project? Probably not so. That's where.

352
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:56.679
Orlando Sequera: following an approach with a flexive scope. A. That's going to be your best, pip. It's about. You can change course. You can change correction, and the team can focus on what they need to do, which is add value to their customers. But they need to have the right approach and

353
00:37:56.690 --> 00:38:09.620
Orlando Sequera: the right, For the right situation. So we need to evaluate that. That's why I was mentioning before, when you are deciding. What type of approach are you following for your project?

354
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:17.399
Orlando Sequera: The first aspect that you have to look at is this code for the Pmp. Exam for the Pmp. Exam.

355
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:25.160
Orlando Sequera: Pay attention to the type of scope that they're giving you in the scenario question. They might give you some hints.

356
00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.549
Orlando Sequera: The

357
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.989
Orlando Sequera: you are the project manager, working on Project X, Y. Z.

358
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:52.140
Orlando Sequera: About replacing the piping system for a small community in rural area. The team is very familiar with this type of project. They have worked on this and similar projects in the past, and they're very familiar with the scope. So that's what you need. The information that you need to take. Okay, they're giving you hints that

359
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.849
Orlando Sequera: going with a fixed

360
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.439
Orlando Sequera: approach going with a predictive approach, may be your best

361
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:07.400
Orlando Sequera: rather than going with an agile approach. So the first aspect that you have to look at is the type of scope of your project. Okay, is King. That is.

362
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:15.420
Orlando Sequera: that's kind of determined. What type of approach should I follow in my project? Okay. But again, in some cases

363
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.529
Orlando Sequera: you can.

364
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:25.320
Orlando Sequera: having following a hybrid approach, is going to be your best bet, because some areas of the scope are going to be well defined, well understood. But

365
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:38.439
Orlando Sequera: it is possible that some other areas of your project are not are complex and not well understood, or you know, going in that they're going to have a lot of changes. That's when a hybrid approach comes into play. But scope

366
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:43.280
Orlando Sequera: the foundation of any project, any project. Okay.

367
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:46.560
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

368
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.500
Orlando Sequera: nowadays nowadays, and I will have to say.

369
00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:05.309
Orlando Sequera: having a fixed cope is becoming more and more and more uncommon, because planning planning rarely happens all at once

370
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:13.469
Orlando Sequera: A. And at the beginning of the project so many organizations are switching or pivoting to what we call rolling wave planning.

371
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:14.770
Orlando Sequera: which

372
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.729
Orlando Sequera: enables you to begin to work, do some work.

373
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.569
Orlando Sequera: and then

374
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:29.959
Orlando Sequera: over time. When more information becomes available, you start understanding more about the scope. So many organizations are doing that.

375
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.479
Orlando Sequera: and of what, of course, in construction.

376
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:43.650
Orlando Sequera: not so much. They have narrowed that down to a science in some industries they still follow a fixed scope approach construction. Being one of them.

377
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:59.289
Orlando Sequera: they narrow that down to a science, otherwise they will lose money. Those construction companies. So they understand that scope really really really well. But a fixed scope approach is increasingly uncommon nowadays due to the complexity.

378
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:07.230
Orlando Sequera: and this is becoming more and more and more prevalent in many industries, this rolling wave planning, and then.

379
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.870
Orlando Sequera: by following this approach.

380
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:11.429
Orlando Sequera: you can

381
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.300
Orlando Sequera: do some work, understand more of the scope, and then decompose as more information

382
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:35.660
Orlando Sequera: becomes available about this couple of the work. You understand more about your project. Then you can start a decomposing those service of the scope, and that is that that's how you're able to be more successful. It really it really helps. This is used in both approaches, regardless of

383
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:44.700
Orlando Sequera: whether you're going with a predictive approach. You can also use this in an adaptive approach or agile, so it's becoming more and more a

384
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.919
Orlando Sequera: prevalent, more and more a common to use what is called Rolling Wave Planning.

385
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.049
Orlando Sequera: Now.

386
00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.730
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna watch a video that is gonna help us to understand. These are 2 concepts that are

387
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.060
Orlando Sequera: traveling in agile

388
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.770
Orlando Sequera: one that is called minimum viable product, Mvp.

389
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:12.729
Orlando Sequera: And another one that is called Mbi, which is minimum business increment.

390
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:21.219
Orlando Sequera: This is for agile, and we're gonna start understanding the differences between the 2. We're going to watch this video.

391
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.089
Orlando Sequera: All right.

392
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.820
Orlando Sequera: Let me make sure that i'm sharing my with some. Okay, let's watch this video.

393
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:49.170
One of the cornerstones of Agile is to release incrementally. Build a small but complete piece, release it, learn from it, pivot if needed, and then do it again.

394
00:42:49.300 --> 00:43:03.539
But that's not all there is to it. What you build in each of these incremental releases depends on what your objective is. If you're trying to figure out whether a new product or service is viable. You probably should release a minimum viable product

395
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.470
Orlando Sequera: for my apologies.

396
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:24.120
Minimum viable product is often a prototype where some functionality is simulated or even performed manually. The idea is to do just enough work to get something in front of potential customers and learn what they really want, because a minimum viable product is an investment for discovery.

397
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:31.569
If you are expanding or enhancing an existing product or service, you probably should release a minimum business increment.

398
00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:41.459
A minimum business increment is the smallest releasesable chunk of value that makes sense from a business perspective. A minimum business increment is an investment for revenue

399
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.630
minimum business increments offer several benefits.

400
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.159
They add value for your customers.

401
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.169
They help you determine. If you're building the right thing.

402
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:53.309
they help you figure out. If you're building the right way.

403
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.710
they give you a way to determine if what you're building is actually useful.

404
00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.519
and they enhance your ability to deliver value in the future

405
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.880
minimum. Business increments are one of the most useful concepts in agile.

406
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.530
perfect for setting your agile increment.

407
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:11.919
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

408
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.280
Orlando Sequera: couple of things with the video. These 2 concepts, Mvp. And Mbi are agile concepts.

409
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:28.490
Orlando Sequera: and Mvp. The keyword associated with Mvp. Is bird Bones functionality. If you're starting with a new

410
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.739
Orlando Sequera: product service of results, something that is new.

411
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:33.770
Orlando Sequera: Think of

412
00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:50.550
Orlando Sequera: For example, we're trying to build a messaging app to compete with Whatsapp right or Whatsapp, for example, version one when Whatsapp first came out to market, that is an Mvp. That's an example of an Mvp. We did enough

413
00:44:51.050 --> 00:45:06.800
Orlando Sequera: discovering or enough planning to come up with a prototype to come out to market right based on initial customer preferences at the time, and they came on with. They came out with Bur Bones functionary that was back in 2,006. If i'm not mistaken when they first came out.

414
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.979
Orlando Sequera: and

415
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:20.929
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning they were only targeting iphone users, Ios users not android. So the first version of Whatsapp what's only a available for we're available in the app store for iphone users

416
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:36.340
Orlando Sequera: that they came out to market with that, and it was very simple, a very simple, messaging application. But you are going to that is your Mvp. That is your Mvp. Then over time you start adding enhancements.

417
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:44.890
Orlando Sequera: adding improvements based on what your customers are telling you a. What adds the most value to them.

418
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:50.089
Orlando Sequera: And over time. Your product, service, or result is going to become more robust.

419
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:57.579
Orlando Sequera: That's what we call Mbi. So the key word that I want you to associate with Mvp. Is new product.

420
00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:05.050
Orlando Sequera: It's a prototype new product to come out to market. And that's why in the video that we're saying is an investment for a discovery.

421
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.749
Orlando Sequera: hey? It's a new product.

422
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.609
Orlando Sequera: But when it comes to Mbi I want you to think of

423
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:16.860
Orlando Sequera: exist enhancements the the word, the key word associated with an Mbi is enhancement.

424
00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:23.659
Orlando Sequera: And over time that's going to make it more robust. Okay, so couple of things that I wanted to

425
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.770
Orlando Sequera: a to point out

426
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.979
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to Mbi and Mvps.

427
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.270
Orlando Sequera: And

428
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.030
Orlando Sequera: another important aspect related to scope is that

429
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.520
Orlando Sequera: even though

430
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:44.370
Orlando Sequera: the product roadmap started originally in agile approaches or adaptive approaches. They are so helpful

431
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:50.190
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to development that they also that's what it's used nowadays.

432
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.009
Orlando Sequera: A 4.

433
00:46:52.070 --> 00:47:10.610
Orlando Sequera: A hybrid approaches. It's used to regardless of the approach. Pro roadmaps are have proven. They're worth, and they're used regardless of the approach they actually use in in in. They can be using predictive. They can be using hybrid, and of course they can be used in agile approaches because they let you.

434
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:20.249
Orlando Sequera: They focus on the big picture on the big picture, which sometimes, when we get caught up in the details we miss, we we, we're going.

435
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:40.470
Orlando Sequera: It. It shows that strategy and that direction, and it allows you to focus on value, because at the end of the day what we're trying to achieve that we're trying to remember what we said on day one the definition of success. The success criteria is also tied up to value the we have value with the product. So for a Roman is for

436
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.790
Orlando Sequera: I

437
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.349
Orlando Sequera: a way that allows you to group functionality.

438
00:47:47.980 --> 00:48:01.879
Orlando Sequera: and it allows you to be strategic in making sure that you're not losing side of the big picture, and you're able to focus on what, on the functionality of building the functionality that adds the most value

439
00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:10.059
Orlando Sequera: to your customers, and regardless of the approach. This is a very important aspect. So it's becoming more and more a prevalent.

440
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.460
Orlando Sequera: and allows them to be more successful, so that for a roadmap

441
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.580
Orlando Sequera: approach

442
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.879
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

443
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:18.259
Orlando Sequera: And now

444
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.270
Orlando Sequera: we are going to

445
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.470
Orlando Sequera: a

446
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.240
Orlando Sequera: talk about milestones.

447
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.290
Orlando Sequera: Milestones are

448
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.660
Orlando Sequera: significant events that happen in any project. I mean.

449
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:40.479
Orlando Sequera: remember what we mentioned before about the pro charter. We have a scheduled mountain in the Project Charter, and that is

450
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.270
Orlando Sequera: a way for you

451
00:48:43.720 --> 00:49:03.219
Orlando Sequera: to understand, to have an idea for you as a Pm. And also for your team to have an idea of significant events that are going to be a part of your project at that particular time. But it's a summary milestone level initial. Can that the initial Summer review? Can that change?

452
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:10.249
Orlando Sequera: Yes, but you need to start somewhere, and that's what you get with the project. Charter: so milestones are

453
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.660
Orlando Sequera: going to be.

454
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.689
Orlando Sequera: There are significant events. They're usually tied up to

455
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:25.770
Orlando Sequera: a payments decision making, and he helps your stakeholders, and also they help your

456
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.919
Orlando Sequera: They also help

457
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:37.979
Orlando Sequera: your your team members to understand big events. Review. Significant events that are gonna happen in your project. They usually help in

458
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:43.609
Orlando Sequera: also making sure that if we have any any reporting requirements

459
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:57.580
Orlando Sequera: that need to be met before a particular master, the hit to keep, they help everyone to be a on the same page, making sure that we have those reports or those those documents ready before we hit that milestone

460
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.799
Orlando Sequera: A. They can be created by Pms. In the schedule, or customers and

461
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:21.600
Orlando Sequera: milestones are also tied up to payments. They can indicate payments. So we completed phase one. You should. We can type payments to that completion of pay face one. So our procurement department or purchasing department, can actually make payments to suppliers, for example, Sir Rape.

462
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:28.719
Orlando Sequera: They they're great. They have great use. When you build your schedules you need to identify

463
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:43.579
Orlando Sequera: Do you need to identify masters and make sure that you use them. In some cases you're going to have mandatory milestones for those of you that have had the chance to work with the government. You know exactly what I mean you, or even in the private sector as well. There's some

464
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:58.909
Orlando Sequera: requirements by contracts, or legislation, or loss, or regulations that have mandatory milestones, or in some cases we can use some best practices. That's a but you should use milestones nonetheless.

465
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:01.300
Orlando Sequera: all right

466
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.870
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

467
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.420
Orlando Sequera: planning the scope.

468
00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.779
Orlando Sequera: Scope is.

469
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.219
Orlando Sequera: as I mentioned before, a very important

470
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:20.139
Orlando Sequera: aspect of any project this can make or break their project. If you don't get the scope right.

471
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:25.560
Orlando Sequera: Everything else that you build around your project is going, is it's not gonna work? Okay?

472
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.299
Orlando Sequera: A scope

473
00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:28.609
Orlando Sequera: covers

474
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:37.980
Orlando Sequera: an important aspect and or the foundation of the scope. Let me put it that way are going to be the requirements for your project.

475
00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:42.309
Orlando Sequera: They're going to be the requirements for your project. Okay. So

476
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:48.870
Orlando Sequera: this this is where you as a project manager, you have to help your team

477
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.059
Orlando Sequera: and work with your team members

478
00:51:51.110 --> 00:52:01.080
Orlando Sequera: in making sure that you collect the requirements in a very thorough way. You know it. It it's a very thorough process that you have to follow.

479
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.810
Orlando Sequera: You have to

480
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.960
Orlando Sequera: collect these requirements using multiple

481
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:12.779
Orlando Sequera: tools and techniques is not just brainstorming, and you might think, oh, why, Don't, we get everyone

482
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.569
Orlando Sequera: in that conference room and start asking them about the requirements that should be enough

483
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.730
Orlando Sequera: to a gather requirements. So

484
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:28.009
Orlando Sequera: it's way much more than that. That's one way, by the way. By no means. I'm saying, that's not. That's not

485
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.190
Orlando Sequera: That that's not one way of gathering requirements, but requirements are

486
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.990
Orlando Sequera: can come in any way, shape or form. You should use more than one technique.

487
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.750
Orlando Sequera: You should use more than one technique. That's only one. We're going to talk about those techniques in in in a few minutes.

488
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:50.489
Orlando Sequera: as they are identified as the requirements are collected, they should be documented.

489
00:52:51.250 --> 00:53:01.349
Orlando Sequera: We have a couple of documents that are mentioned here. The scope statement that contains a description of the scope of the work, and then

490
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.919
Orlando Sequera: a very important artifact for your

491
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:24.850
Orlando Sequera: for your project, which is going to be the work. Breakdown structure that we're break the structure. We're going to talk about about that in a little bit more detail. That is a a graphic representation of the entire scope of the project. That is, is, is crucial. That's for predictive projects.

492
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:28.279
Orlando Sequera: the equivalent of the war breakdown structure

493
00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.060
Orlando Sequera: in, add your projects is the product backlog.

494
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.990
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

495
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.589
Orlando Sequera: But the word break. This structure is for

496
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:47.860
Orlando Sequera: projects that are following a predictive approach, and the equivalent in agile is going to be the product backlog. Okay, but that those are the artifacts that are going to allow us to manage this scope of our projects, regardless of the approach.

497
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.949
Orlando Sequera: And then from there

498
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:55.570
Orlando Sequera: we're going to have the foundation that is going to help us to then work and develop

499
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.169
Orlando Sequera: all the areas of our project, like the schedule

500
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:13.949
Orlando Sequera: budget, resource and quality plans, Everything is going to be around the scope. We have to get this right. We have to get the requirements right. We have to get the scope right, because everything else, everything else in our project

501
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:21.899
Orlando Sequera: schedule, but your resources, quality, everything else, is going to be built around the scope of our project

502
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.570
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to add your projects.

503
00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.209
Orlando Sequera: This toward of the scope

504
00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:30.709
Orlando Sequera: is going to be the product owner.

505
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.359
Orlando Sequera: Remember that's the liaison

506
00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.279
Orlando Sequera: between the business and

507
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.710
Orlando Sequera: the and the team.

508
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:46.779
Orlando Sequera: There is an individual in charge of creating the pro backlog, which is the equivalent of the Wbs in predictive.

509
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.669
Orlando Sequera: and the team members are going to

510
00:54:52.030 --> 00:55:00.359
Orlando Sequera: be the ones that are estimating the effort associated with building that functionality that is contained in the pro backlock.

511
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.410
Orlando Sequera: A.

512
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:17.040
Orlando Sequera: And they're the ones that are going, and and we write requirements in agile in a different way. We use the concept of a user. Story. That's why that's how we write requirements in agile. But we need to understand requirements, regardless of the approach. We need to understand requirements.

513
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:21.239
Orlando Sequera: But the team members they're the ones that estimate the effort.

514
00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.990
Orlando Sequera: They're the ones that

515
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:39.980
Orlando Sequera: decide how much work can be completed in each iteration, and they're the ones that are going to be sequencing the work that is going to be done to deliver those requirements so a little bit different. We do scope planning, regardless of the approach.

516
00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:54.219
Orlando Sequera: That's how it happens in Agile. It is very structure the way it happens in predictive. Okay, we collect requirements. Then we document those requirements. We prepare a scope statement and we build

517
00:55:54.230 --> 00:56:02.629
Orlando Sequera: a structure that is called the War breakdown structure. And then we build everything else around that

518
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.959
Orlando Sequera: or break the structure. Okay.

519
00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.890
Orlando Sequera: I

520
00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.959
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna we're gonna

521
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:17.499
Orlando Sequera: be working on him? The questions after we come back from break. We're going to start answering some of the questions

522
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.310
Orlando Sequera: as, as, as we mentioned before.

523
00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:29.120
Orlando Sequera: A. We are going to get started with requirements. This is the foundation of the scope. So

524
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:34.890
Orlando Sequera: that's this project. That's this kind of project. They start with requirements, and

525
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.479
Orlando Sequera: the answer is, Yes.

526
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:40.569
Orlando Sequera: if the answer is yes. In predicted projects

527
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:57.630
Orlando Sequera: requirements are elicited and set at the beginning of the project. So if you need to start with requirements, that's a hint for predictive that might be your best bet the project the the project has to start by collecting those requirements and the at the very beginning. But what about sort of

528
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:16.929
Orlando Sequera: if the answer is, sort of do we get? Do we get started? Then user? Stories are a different way of thinking about the requirement process that's giving you a hint for agile. But if the answer is, maybe then it, you might have a combination. Their hybrid projects are going to elicit and refine a requirements or compose

529
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.310
Orlando Sequera: user stories.

530
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.799
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

531
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.470
Orlando Sequera: requirements.

532
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.890
Orlando Sequera: What I? What do I mean by requirements

533
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.729
Orlando Sequera: is

534
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.710
Orlando Sequera: one single.

535
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:40.160
Orlando Sequera: This is a textbook definition. By the way, one single measurable statement of a condition or capability.

536
00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:42.640
Orlando Sequera: We

537
00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.259
Orlando Sequera: think of a software project

538
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:49.610
Orlando Sequera: a requirement could be to generate to build a monthly sales report.

539
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.219
Orlando Sequera: If we're following an edge. That approach. We're going to be writing that

540
00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:01.110
Orlando Sequera: requirement in the form of a user story, or I need to be able to log in

541
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:10.209
Orlando Sequera: a every another requirement for that accounting software could be. I need to be able to log in without

542
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.159
Orlando Sequera: creating a new.

543
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.599
Orlando Sequera: a username and password.

544
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:22.700
Orlando Sequera: or that software that that could be another requirement. Or let's go back to the house we're building a house.

545
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.780
Orlando Sequera: A requirement. Is

546
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.109
Orlando Sequera: for example.

547
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.279
Orlando Sequera: a we

548
00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.699
Orlando Sequera: are building a one-story house in the South Florida area

549
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.339
Orlando Sequera: that needs to meet the

550
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:54.259
Orlando Sequera: county and city and county guidelines for the the building code for the city and for the county that needs to meet the building code, Basically, For example, this exterior structure has to be

551
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:56.030
Orlando Sequera: built, using concrete

552
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.470
Orlando Sequera: to withstand

553
00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:09.570
Orlando Sequera: up to category 3 hurricanes we need. That's a hard requirement. That is a actual requirement that is coming from a compliance. That's a compliance requirement. Remember that we mentioned compliance on day one

554
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:21.650
Orlando Sequera: but another requirement could be we coming from the customer, saying we would like to have tile floors or carpet floors for the rooms. That's another requirement, or another requirement is that

555
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:31.000
Orlando Sequera: the exterior walls are painted in white white color for exterior walls and internal walls are painted in gray, for example or blue.

556
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:36.720
Orlando Sequera: That's another requirement or another requirement could be that that we have a metal roof.

557
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:37.540
Orlando Sequera: or

558
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.719
Orlando Sequera: that we have a single proof.

559
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:48.509
Orlando Sequera: Okay, those are requirements. It's something that we can measure if something that related to a condition or a capability.

560
00:59:48.570 --> 01:00:05.470
Orlando Sequera: And it also tells how the product service of result in this case. In this example the House satisfies a business need. So we're building that one story house for a particular customer to meet their business needs. Okay, a

561
01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:19.709
Orlando Sequera: few guidelines for requirements. We should start at a high level before we get into the details, but it is extremely extremely important that we get this right they shouldn't be

562
01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.370
Orlando Sequera: ambiguous.

563
01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.579
Orlando Sequera: and by that I mean

564
01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:38.119
Orlando Sequera: they should be. You should be able to measure their requirement, and you should be able to test the requirement, regardless of the approach, regardless of the approach, you should be able to trace the requirement to what? To your deliverables

565
01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:43.369
Orlando Sequera: at the end of the day. What we do with our projects is to produce deliverables.

566
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.650
Orlando Sequera: Producing the neighborhoods means

567
01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.970
Orlando Sequera: producing building those requirements.

568
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:57.529
Orlando Sequera: You have it. It's a relationship right. Your deliberables are going to be tied up to your requirements. It's not always

569
01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:07.010
Orlando Sequera: one to 1 one deliverable tied up to one requirement. No, it can be one too many, but at the end of the day, in the other, in the far end of the spectrum

570
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:14.749
Orlando Sequera: we have requirements that tell us what type of house are we going to be building? And then we're going to ask. We produce

571
01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:33.530
Orlando Sequera: those requirements with our project work. That is, this couple of project. Then we're going to be producing those deliverables, and that's when the house comes to fruition right with the middle roof. Why is it metal and not shingles? Because the requirement was to build a house with metal roof. Why is the house painting in white for exterior walls?

572
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.370
Orlando Sequera: That was the requirement, so we should be able to

573
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:48.900
Orlando Sequera: keep those aligned, and we should be able to trace our deliverables. What we produce with our work all the way back to requirements, and for that we use

574
01:01:49.040 --> 01:02:00.070
Orlando Sequera: another document that is gonna help. That is called requirements traceability, matrix, and that is going to help us to trace back what we produce

575
01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:03.649
Orlando Sequera: with our work all the way back to

576
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.059
Orlando Sequera: their requirements. Okay.

577
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.129
Orlando Sequera: A:

578
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:10.439
Orlando Sequera: this can be simple.

579
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:23.869
Orlando Sequera: They listen the requirements and categorize by priority, or it can be more elaborate with detailed descriptions, detailed attachments. This is just just a a quick

580
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:31.239
Orlando Sequera: A quick example. For for you to visualize what the requirements flexibility, matrix. Okay.

581
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:38.330
Orlando Sequera: important concept. So we are ready for a first break when we come back. I'm: going to be reviewing the questions

582
01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:44.030
Orlando Sequera: and in the Q. A. And we're going to continue with the content. All right.

583
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:47.999
Orlando Sequera: So enjoy your break, and we will be back

584
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:19.739
Orlando Sequera: all right. Welcome back, everyone. We're gonna continue with the class. but we're gonna start by

585
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:24.500
Orlando Sequera: answering some of the questions.

586
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.300
Orlando Sequera: All right.

587
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.160
Orlando Sequera: all right. There is a question

588
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.330
Orlando Sequera: that I would like to address before we continue is there.

589
01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:47.659
Orlando Sequera: Can you please make a practical example of running wave? Planning

590
01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:51.440
Orlando Sequera: is widely used in

591
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:54.619
Orlando Sequera: new product development.

592
01:03:54.730 --> 01:04:00.529
Orlando Sequera: right? When you start to develop, let's assume that we are a working on

593
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.959
Orlando Sequera: developing

594
01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.770
Orlando Sequera: as software application

595
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:08.850
Orlando Sequera: for messaging or for

596
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.319
Orlando Sequera: streaming movies. And in

597
01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.600
Orlando Sequera: in the

598
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:26.390
Orlando Sequera: and we're trying to compete with Netflix to get in that space this thing plus Netflix, Amazon, prime, etc. Right? That's our our new product in this case a new service, not a new product. So, but it's new right. It's new.

599
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:30.950
Orlando Sequera: and we have been able to

600
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:35.590
Orlando Sequera: plan out. We we estimate it that it's gonna take us 8 months

601
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:36.509
Orlando Sequera: to

602
01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.540
Orlando Sequera: come out to Market

603
01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:49.570
Orlando Sequera: A. But we plan really well with what we know. This is something that we haven't done before, but with the information that we have right now

604
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:58.909
Orlando Sequera: we were able to plan and map out the first 3 months of this development process, but after that.

605
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:11.690
Orlando Sequera: after the 3 months we we need more information. We need to validate customer preferences. We need to validate some of our assumptions, and we don't really have any way of

606
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:24.480
Orlando Sequera: at this particular point in time. We need to go through those 3 months that we know exactly what we need to do to gather more information and then map out or plan out the rest

607
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:35.980
Orlando Sequera: of the other 5 months that we have been able to determine, and maybe we come to the conclusion that we need not. 5 more months we might need 6 more months, or 7 more months. We

608
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:53.540
Orlando Sequera: only know what we know at this particular moment. But there's so many variables, so many questions at this moment that we don't know about this. The rest of the scope of the application or the service that we're trying to build that. Let's focus on what we know. Well build it. Well.

609
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:59.699
Orlando Sequera: more information is going to become available, and then we can plan out properly to be more efficient

610
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:03.049
Orlando Sequera: A with that

611
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:12.139
Orlando Sequera: with with our with our resources. Another example that I can give you from Aerospace. When the art of this program started right.

612
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.930
Orlando Sequera: The intention was to build a new spacecraft.

613
01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.710
Orlando Sequera: the Orion spacecraft.

614
01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.319
Orlando Sequera: But

615
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.080
Orlando Sequera: we started

616
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:39.769
Orlando Sequera: when we started working on on the Artemis program. We only we had information, and we have. We had lessons learned from previous programs. We had the the Apollo program, but that was in in a different era. But most recently the the actual shutter program.

617
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:43.439
Orlando Sequera: Okay? And there were a few things that are similar.

618
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.899
Orlando Sequera: And we started by working on those areas of the scope. What we knew

619
01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:49.799
Orlando Sequera: A

620
01:06:50.130 --> 01:07:09.599
Orlando Sequera: from this shuttle program. But this is a spacecraft. This is not a shuttle. There were many differences, so we had to do work and develop and understand, do some development and and do some work. We were able to plan some of it, but we needed additional information to

621
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:23.570
Orlando Sequera: plan out the rest of the work, more information needed to become available, and that's in that case we use the rolling wave planning approach. Okay, more information became available. So that's

622
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:43.770
Orlando Sequera: a more and more and more Organizations are doing that because they and you might be wondering Why are they doing that? Why don't they map out everything. They should know everything. No. Remember that environments are more more and more complex. There's a lot of complexity there's a lot of changes happening nowadays, so organizations are trying to be as

623
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:54.509
Orlando Sequera: efficient as possible when it comes to using the resources. And this approach is becoming more and more prevalent with rolling wave planning. Okay.

624
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.310
Orlando Sequera: All right.

625
01:07:58.770 --> 01:07:59.979
Orlando Sequera: That's a

626
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.569
Orlando Sequera: That's a great question.

627
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:04.009
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

628
01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:11.000
Orlando Sequera: Another question. How does the product manager of the semester work together? Okay, to

629
01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.679
Orlando Sequera: similar skill set for different.

630
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.420
Orlando Sequera: This chrome master is going to

631
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:22.469
Orlando Sequera: make sure that the team and the stakeholders are following

632
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:35.150
Orlando Sequera: from practices. It's also going to serve as a buffer to protect the team, to shield the team, and it's going to remove impediments acting as a servant leader for this chrome team. But the project manager covers all their areas.

633
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:48.300
Orlando Sequera: They we have a schedule that we have to manage. We have the scope that we have to manage. We have the budget that we have to manage so similar skills in some ways. But those organizations that have a

634
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.359
Orlando Sequera: scrum masters and a project managers.

635
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.200
Orlando Sequera: They complement each other, and they don't

636
01:08:56.310 --> 01:09:01.629
Orlando Sequera: our step boundaries, that those lines are well defined, so they work together. They

637
01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:06.689
Orlando Sequera: it's perfectly fine to work it together, but it's a little bit of a different skill. Set

638
01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.439
Orlando Sequera: a

639
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.729
Orlando Sequera: okay. Let me continue to review the questions.

640
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:33.009
Orlando Sequera: Are there any common or highly recommended tools or creating the roadmap? Absolutely. There are tools out there like Trello or Jira.

641
01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:38.950
Orlando Sequera: or version one. There are multiple tools out there that can help you to create a roadmap

642
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:45.929
Orlando Sequera: whatsoever. Besides Microsoft project to manage

643
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:56.809
Orlando Sequera: for project management world. You have Primavera, you have Trello. They do have a work day. There are tons of software out there that can help you with.

644
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.790
Orlando Sequera: With that it's not just

645
01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:04.709
Orlando Sequera: It's not just a micro project.

646
01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.069
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference

647
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.389
Orlando Sequera: oops? My apologies?

648
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.560
Orlando Sequera: Do you mean to do that?

649
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:16.690
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

650
01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:32.389
Orlando Sequera: what is the difference between masters and the backlog? Well, the backlog is a container

651
01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:36.649
Orlando Sequera: that we use in edge of projects to

652
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:40.130
Orlando Sequera: that can, what what we can, what

653
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:47.470
Orlando Sequera: it's, a container. The product backlog is a container that we use in edge of projects for the functionality

654
01:10:47.600 --> 01:11:01.719
Orlando Sequera: that needs to be developed by the project team in that agile project. If those that function is represented in the form of user stories and remember that user stories. That's how we write requirements in agile

655
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.429
Orlando Sequera: A a milestone is a significant event

656
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.260
Orlando Sequera: in the project. So 2 different things.

657
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.830
Orlando Sequera: totally different things.

658
01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:19.059
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

659
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:25.880
Orlando Sequera: this was the answer.

660
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.480
Orlando Sequera: we celebrate a little bit. On the next we metaphor.

661
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:38.839
Orlando Sequera: Let's try to ask the questions that are related to the content that we're covering really quick. The Xp metaphor is simply to we're trying to understand

662
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.370
Orlando Sequera: the vision of the project, and it's simply

663
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:54.849
Orlando Sequera: a way to represent the characteristics. I'm trying to. We're trying to build a new music app the compete with Pandora. We want this music app to be able to read my

664
01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:05.609
Orlando Sequera: to re our minds and play this some based on our current emotional state. That's a metaphor, right? So it's some. It's a way to understand the vision of the project.

665
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:07.370
Okay.

666
01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:13.370
Orlando Sequera: So some questions. I'm going to continue

667
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:15.049
Orlando Sequera: with the

668
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.139
Orlando Sequera: content

669
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.860
Orlando Sequera: Project Scope is bigger than pro scope. Actually, no is the other way around.

670
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:33.699
Orlando Sequera: It's the other way around you many multiple projects to deliver the entire product scope. Remember the graphic that we that we saw yesterday many multiple projects to that

671
01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.319
Orlando Sequera: are gonna fit in in that broader life cycle. Okay.

672
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.440
Orlando Sequera: But

673
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.930
Orlando Sequera: the point is

674
01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:59.080
Orlando Sequera: product scope is about functionality. It's about features. Imagine a car, for example, the engine, the how many mass per gallon, the interior, the exterior, the characteristics that's functionality.

675
01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:04.739
Orlando Sequera: But they work that needs to be done to produce that car. That is project scope.

676
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:19.289
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and he might be multiple projects that you need in order to produce and build that car. So pro products scope is of a functionality project scope is about the work that needs to be done to produce, to build that

677
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:24.730
Orlando Sequera: a to build that product in this case. But it could also be a service, and it could also be a result.

678
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:26.380
Orlando Sequera: All right.

679
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:32.240
Orlando Sequera: can we go over rolling plan Broadway planning? We did.

680
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.890
Orlando Sequera: Backlog is a repository.

681
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.959
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the chat.

682
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:47.590
Orlando Sequera: in the in the Q. A. I keep saying chat. My apologies is in the Q. A.

683
01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.320
Orlando Sequera: And

684
01:13:53.830 --> 01:14:01.529
Orlando Sequera: okay, Can this chrome master and project manager functions be performed by the same person? Absolutely. Yes, yes, that's perfectly fine.

685
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:06.929
Orlando Sequera: So

686
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:18.599
Orlando Sequera: the backlog is essentially a repository of all the material support in the scope, not the material. It's about the functionality that needs to be built in our project, their requirements.

687
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:28.559
Orlando Sequera: What we have in the backlog are the requirements that the team has to build for that particular project. It's a repository of the the requirements we write

688
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:46.910
Orlando Sequera: requirements in agile using user. Stories. Okay, so that's what we mean, but it is a container, but a container of what a container of the functionality, a container of the requirements that we have to build in our agile project, and we call those requirements user stories.

689
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.940
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

690
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:53.600
Orlando Sequera: all right. So let's go ahead and continue.

691
01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.389
Orlando Sequera: and with the content.

692
01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:05.089
Orlando Sequera: One more question that I would like to address in agile. The scrum team performs the estimation, Yes, in predictive.

693
01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:10.190
Orlando Sequera: who will perform the estimation and break down the tasks.

694
01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:16.830
Orlando Sequera: Good question and the answer is ideally also the people doing the work

695
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:20.500
Orlando Sequera: we can help as project managers.

696
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:32.309
Orlando Sequera: but ideally, even in predictive, the recommendation is to have the people doing the work be the ones to estimate, doing the estimation as well. Remember that for

697
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:41.290
Orlando Sequera: the exam as well, the people that are doing the work ideally should be the ones also estimating the effort and breaking down that effort

698
01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.800
Orlando Sequera: into tasks.

699
01:15:43.860 --> 01:16:03.800
Orlando Sequera: It's a recommendation in predictive. But in agile is a mosque. That's what we mean by self-organized and self-managed, Nigel. They simply know that's how it is the people that are doing the work are the ones estimating and are the ones breaking down those user stories from the backlog into tasks. That's

700
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:11.530
Orlando Sequera: a black box for the project. Managers a black box for everyone else is up to the team. That's what we mean by self-manage, but

701
01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:12.570
Orlando Sequera: for

702
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.910
Orlando Sequera: A.

703
01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:27.299
Orlando Sequera: For the for teams that are following a predictive approach is a recommendation. It's a recommendation not necessarily happens that way, but it's a recommendation that the people doing the work They're the most familiar

704
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.950
Orlando Sequera: with the word that needs to be done. Therefore they should be, they once

705
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:44.000
Orlando Sequera: doing the estimation, and also helping for the project manager with breaking down those requirements into tasks. At least they should be at the very least they should be involved in the process.

706
01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:49.750
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that's a good question. All right. So let's continue with the content.

707
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.030
Orlando Sequera: Scope is so important that we have

708
01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.580
Orlando Sequera: 2 plans.

709
01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.620
Orlando Sequera: We need one specific plan for requirements, and then we're also going to have

710
01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:20.209
Orlando Sequera: a specific plan for scope. It. It is so important, because, the requirements being the foundation of every single project. We need to plan for those requirements to make sure that we are a

711
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:38.540
Orlando Sequera: we. We are following a thorough process, and that we are covering all the basis. We need a specific strategy, a specific plan for those requirements. We need to know how we are gonna gather those requirements, how we're gonna track those requirements because they're gonna be changing.

712
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:53.280
Orlando Sequera: How are we going to be reporting on those requirements? And we need to plan for that. That's where an important aspect that we call configuration management is going to help us tremendously, because, as requirements evolve

713
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.720
Orlando Sequera: over time that can change.

714
01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.209
Orlando Sequera: We need to have

715
01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:07.860
Orlando Sequera: got rails in place that are gonna help us to make sure that we're working with the latest and greatest version of those requirements. That's where configuration management. It comes into play.

716
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:19.719
Orlando Sequera: With version control rules and impact analysis on those changes, and it's also going to specify the level of authorization that we need for change approvals

717
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:39.560
Orlando Sequera: the protestation criteria, and also metrics that are, and the rationale that comes with those metrics. And what is the traceability structure like the requirements, traceability, matrix that we saw? What are we going to use to keep track of those changes of those requirements? Because

718
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:46.869
Orlando Sequera: the requirements are going to be changing it not only in agile projects, also in

719
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:56.390
Orlando Sequera: in our. If, if we're building the house, following a predictive approach requirements can change our a. Our customers can say

720
01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:06.919
Orlando Sequera: we do not want to have a a middle roof anymore. We want to use a tile Spanish tiles for for the roof instead of metal. That's a change

721
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:09.640
Orlando Sequera: it so how can we

722
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:20.920
Orlando Sequera: document that? That was an actual change? That's what the requirements management plan is going to help us with. So the author, what is the authorization who authorize this change? Because when we deliver the house

723
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:41.219
Orlando Sequera: we have, we have to have a way to show to our customer. Well, Mr. Mr. Mrs. Customer, this this is a house. Build to your specifications, to your requirements, based on requirements that we got. Oh, but we one in the middle roof. We didn't want a a Spanish style roof. What? What happened? No, this is

724
01:19:41.360 --> 01:20:00.600
Orlando Sequera: This is the actual approval on changing the roof from metal to Spanish style to prevent those situations, we gotta have that under control, but we cannot be making those rules as we are building the house, or we shouldn't. At least that's why we plan for that before we're we're in the planning status of the project.

725
01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:13.340
Orlando Sequera: That's why we're planning on how we're going to do that. How we're going to keep those requirements in under control. They changes. Can they change. Yes, but we need to keep track of those changes. That's that plan effort.

726
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.729
Orlando Sequera: The outcome is going to be this requirements management plan

727
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:20.269
Orlando Sequera: because requirements are

728
01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.370
Orlando Sequera: they come in

729
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:25.030
Orlando Sequera: multiple

730
01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:28.300
Orlando Sequera: the ways they are

731
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:33.790
Orlando Sequera: the and this is for, by the way, this is for predicted projects.

732
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.699
Orlando Sequera: requirements can come in any way, shape or form you have.

733
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:39.129
Orlando Sequera: you might have

734
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:51.769
Orlando Sequera: project requirements. Imagine, if you have an actual Pmo in place, there might be some project requirements that you have to meet. Every single project in your organization has to meet those requirements.

735
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:53.759
Orlando Sequera: But you're also gonna have

736
01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:02.199
Orlando Sequera: functional requirements. Product requirements. That's what we call product requirements. They are tied up to functional reform.

737
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:08.749
Orlando Sequera: to functional features. And then non functional features. What you're building is they're gonna have

738
01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:20.569
Orlando Sequera: functional requirements and non functional requirements. These are features characterist. This is tied up directly to the product, right to the service or the result that we're building. Okay, a.

739
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:25.139
Orlando Sequera: And really important, that we define those.

740
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:38.250
Orlando Sequera: but we might also have quality requirements that we need to meet based on our a quality policy based on the industry we might be break. It might be a highly regulated industry.

741
01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:48.369
Orlando Sequera: For example, health care, medical device, manufacturing may be highly regulated, so we might have some quality standards that we have to meet as well. Those are requirements as well.

742
01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.189
Orlando Sequera: Then we also might have business requirements.

743
01:21:52.250 --> 01:22:07.250
Orlando Sequera: And this is where those business analysts can help us with defining and collecting this business requirements. And for some of you you might be familiar with a Brd. That's a business requirement documentation

744
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:19.350
Orlando Sequera: that is tied up to this specific type of requirement. But that's not the only type of requirement. You might also have stakeholder requirements. Going back to your

745
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:24.030
Orlando Sequera: a stakeholder register. Some of your stakeholders might have told you

746
01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.509
Orlando Sequera: their preferences when it comes to reporting.

747
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:35.380
Orlando Sequera: and those are stakeholder requirements. So you need to take those into account, and then you might also have

748
01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.809
Orlando Sequera: transition.

749
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:56.939
Orlando Sequera: slash readiness, requirements before your project transitions to reduction before your product your product service resource is deployed to a live environment, and it starts being used by your customer. Okay, so multiple types of requirements.

750
01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:01.799
Orlando Sequera: And that's the reason why, when it comes to

751
01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:07.670
Orlando Sequera: a gathering requirements or collecting requirements. We have to

752
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:14.560
Orlando Sequera: make sure that we use multiple techniques to collect these requirements.

753
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:34.089
Orlando Sequera: Multiple techniques is not just okay. Let's get everyone in a conference room. Our customers. The stakeholders and the list are whiteboarding their requirements. We start doing that, and that should be enough. No, that's one technique based. It's one technique. You see it on their data gathering. But

754
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:38.810
Orlando Sequera: you should use multiple techniques, and the reason is

755
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:48.959
Orlando Sequera: due to the fact that, as we just saw in the previous slide requirements can come in any way, shape or form. So you should use more than one technique.

756
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:54.300
Orlando Sequera: Expert judgment is one technique. We mentioned that yesterday this

757
01:23:54.460 --> 01:24:10.970
Orlando Sequera: mainly comes. This is the expertise that your team members, your product team members, have. They have worked in similar projects. They have built a similar accounting, a similar software to compared to the accounting software that they're working on, or they have

758
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:20.069
Orlando Sequera: worked in a similar project before they have built the same type of house before multiple times, that expertise. They might help you with gathering requirements. Okay.

759
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:36.540
Orlando Sequera: this is what we have done in the past. We deal with this information, and we deal with a similar project in the past, and these are the requirements that we that we can think of. So that is expert judgment mainly from the subject matter experts, but you can also use

760
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:38.649
Orlando Sequera: in your personal team skills.

761
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:48.630
Orlando Sequera: You can use observation or job shadowing you. You can uncover a lot. And this is something that I have personally used

762
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:58.110
Orlando Sequera: multiple times, With other in many projects. When I've tried to uncover some requirements because your

763
01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:04.500
Orlando Sequera: customer, they usually are very familiar with their with their daily operations. They

764
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:24.330
Orlando Sequera: you're trying to develop a new software then you start asking them what what are the requirements that you need to to have in this accounting software? So they tell you usually what they're familiar with, what they use on a daily basis. But maybe there is this report that they only generate every 3 months

765
01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.559
Orlando Sequera: that they don't think about so.

766
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:35.200
Orlando Sequera: But we went to uncover those requirements as well. So that's where observation we job shadow incomes really into plates.

767
01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:43.220
Orlando Sequera: and it's basically, okay, Mr. Mrs. Customer, I would like to spend a few hours with you. I'm gonna be a

768
01:25:43.780 --> 01:26:09.089
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to be with you observing what you're doing in your daily tasks, and i'm going to be making some notes. I'm going to be gathering requirements that way. So you just work as you normally do, and i'm just going to be paying attention to what you're doing. I'm going to be carrying requirements that way or facilitation. Of course you're going to have some guided sessions to start working on your a on gathering requirements, if

769
01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:26.470
Orlando Sequera: you might be leading that in many cases your role as the Pm. Is going to be that of the facilitator, the moderator of those discussions, you might have some groups of a group of stakeholders working with the team members in trying to uncover a some of those requirements, but

770
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.110
Orlando Sequera: you might use additional techniques like brainstorming.

771
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:45.949
Orlando Sequera: getting everybody together, talking about the requirements. They also interviews with some specific users in a more controlled setting. You might use focus groups, which is a little bit it's an iteration of brainstorming

772
01:26:46.250 --> 01:27:05.329
Orlando Sequera: a, or an evolution of brainstorming. Not an iteration or brainstorming an evolution of brainstorming in which you do have some a specific topics that you want to cover, and then you focus on that and address those areas of your of the product service of result that you're trying to address.

773
01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:10.079
Orlando Sequera: But you can also a there's something that is gonna happen

774
01:27:10.150 --> 01:27:13.519
Orlando Sequera: in a group setting, and that is bias.

775
01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:17.989
Orlando Sequera: There are gonna be some people that are gonna take over

776
01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:25.680
Orlando Sequera: the conversation. They're going to take over the sessions under the extroverts are going to take over the introverts are not.

777
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:32.590
Orlando Sequera: They might have great input, but you are they? They might feel a little intimidated in sharing that input.

778
01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:51.449
Orlando Sequera: or even worse than that, they might fall through the trap of group thinking. We want to avoid that. We went to collect every single requirement, so to reduce bias. We can also send questioners to people, and also for the sake of time, right? Because it's not always possible to get everyone in the same room, same questioners or surveys.

779
01:27:51.550 --> 01:28:00.239
Orlando Sequera: and you can use benchmarking compared to similar products in the past. Of course. Review documentation. That's why we work with Opas.

780
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:09.949
Orlando Sequera: That's why we gather. OP: it's review documentation. That is applicable to the to the project. You might uncover requirements by doing that. A.

781
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:11.309
Orlando Sequera: For

782
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.949
Orlando Sequera: a mainly natural projects. You can.

783
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:32.969
Orlando Sequera: or even in predicted products as well you can perform. You can use voting on what needs to be what is a requirement? What should be a requirement? You can perform analysis of multi criteria reviewing requirements, and then you can start grouping those requirements

784
01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:46.089
Orlando Sequera: together in categories to avoid duplication and to make sure you start classifying those requirements that's where mind mapping comes into play. It's an evolution of brainstorming. When you start

785
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:54.510
Orlando Sequera: grouping categories, those requirements, and then affidity, diagram very similar as well. It's a way to classify those requirements as well.

786
01:28:55.180 --> 01:29:08.790
Orlando Sequera: or in some cases, when especially when you're trying e. When you're working with a scope that is rather complex, the requirements around complex. You might build in some cases a prototype in order to

787
01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:23.770
Orlando Sequera: a gather more feedback, more input from your customers. So, as you can see multiple techniques, multiple ways, multiple tools that we have tools and techniques that we have available to gather requirements

788
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:28.969
Orlando Sequera: because requirements can come in any way, shape or form.

789
01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:29.780
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

790
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:38.409
Orlando Sequera: how to collect requirements. when it comes to

791
01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:42.659
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to to your projects and

792
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:45.390
Orlando Sequera: it, we can use interviews.

793
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:52.850
Orlando Sequera: They, these interviews can be structured on structure, and the goal is to understand features and and and functions.

794
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:57.010
Orlando Sequera: You can send question, what are the advantages that come with the interviews

795
01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:12.370
Orlando Sequera: you can handle. Sensitive, confidential information may have some privacy, because you're containing, you know, with a group setting. You may have individual interviews, and that is something that I would personally recommend with key stakeholders. I will have an interview with key stakeholders

796
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:24.330
Orlando Sequera: to understand really well their take on requirements, but it has some limitations or some drawbacks. It usually captures only a single point of view.

797
01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:30.280
Orlando Sequera: You can also use questioners and surveys. You capture information from a large group.

798
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:40.080
Orlando Sequera: It's a quick turnaround. It has multiple advantages, and it can give you quantity file 25 or data, but it can be time consuming and

799
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:47.540
Orlando Sequera: the data, and it's going to be the the quality of the data that you get is going to be based on the

800
01:30:47.760 --> 01:31:02.030
Orlando Sequera: What are the other questions? Right garbage in garbage out. In some cases, Unfortunately, observation, this is about job shadowing. It's a physical technique, learning it. It. It. It's a great it's a great way to

801
01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:19.299
Orlando Sequera: uncover requirements for observation, job shadowing and the team can understand. It gives an an edge to the team members to understand where changes can be beneficial. They might uncover some a redundant steps that that their customers are taking, or

802
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:22.350
Orlando Sequera: they they might find improvements by doing that

803
01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:40.690
Orlando Sequera: focus groups. You have moderators talking about specific topics. It's not just open-ended. You have the specific topics or areas of the product service of result. That You would like to a address for requirements, you might have pre-selected participants.

804
01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:58.019
Orlando Sequera: A and small groups for focus approach to be more successful. But this requires that your stakeholders are pre-qualified, and that your subject matter experts are being the ones that are guiding the discussion and facilities and facilitating

805
01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.249
Orlando Sequera: you can have facilitated workshops

806
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:07.070
Orlando Sequera: usually facilitated by you as a Pm. The goal here is to capture requirements.

807
01:32:07.170 --> 01:32:09.280
Orlando Sequera: and another advantage is that

808
01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.679
Orlando Sequera: the stakeholders understand the concerns and requirements of others.

809
01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:13.670
Orlando Sequera: They bought.

810
01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:29.789
Orlando Sequera: The key aspect is to make sure that facilitation you have to. That is on you. You're mainly going to be the facilitator. Make sure that we do not go. We stick to the goal, which is to uncover requirements so multiple ways that can help you

811
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:39.070
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to requirements. It's, and it's about communication. This is where your soft skills are going to come handy. Your facilitation skills are a important

812
01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:40.690
Orlando Sequera: we have

813
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:44.209
Orlando Sequera: for data gathering benchmark.

814
01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.639
Orlando Sequera: benchmarking.

815
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:47.979
Orlando Sequera: It is

816
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:52.570
Orlando Sequera: it can help you, and it's basically comparing to something that was done in the past.

817
01:32:52.850 --> 01:33:11.970
Orlando Sequera: And you can even compare to in some cases, if you have that information available to, compared to some other best practices of other organizations, if at all, if at all possible. Okay, and that can help you to identify, to identify some best practices that could be useful in your a

818
01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.290
Orlando Sequera: in your process of collecting requirements.

819
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.909
Orlando Sequera: Some can we remember some of the other methods. We said, that we use

820
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.870
Orlando Sequera: brainstorming.

821
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:31.180
Orlando Sequera: We said that we use interviews, focus groups and questioners and surveys.

822
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.139
Orlando Sequera: but

823
01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:34.280
Orlando Sequera: great.

824
01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.639
Orlando Sequera: You may be wondering.

825
01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:44.999
Orlando Sequera: We have tons of requirements. We have tons of requirements. And we're followed our

826
01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.360
Orlando Sequera: A.

827
01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:58.030
Orlando Sequera: Is everything gonna make it to our project? We we we use all those multiple techniques, and we uncover hundreds of or or thousands of requirements for a project.

828
01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.059
Orlando Sequera: Is everything going to make it to the project?

829
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.359
Orlando Sequera: This your answer is, no.

830
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.950
Orlando Sequera: We have to

831
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.299
Orlando Sequera: prioritize these requirements, not because we were able to identify them.

832
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:14.480
Orlando Sequera: All of those requirements are going to make it to our project, and you might be wondering

833
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.900
Orlando Sequera: why is that

834
01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:24.179
Orlando Sequera: we you been 10 min that we have to use multiple techniques and gather as many requirements as possible. But remember.

835
01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:32.199
Orlando Sequera: we have limited resources. We Don't have an unlimited amount of money and an unlimited amount of time, and an unlimited

836
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:45.589
Orlando Sequera: army of people that is going to be working on this project. We have limited resources. Therefore we have to prioritize those requirements for that we have multiple techniques. First, one is

837
01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:52.850
Orlando Sequera: what we call the most cow analysis, and the Moscow is no, not Russia's capital it is

838
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.520
Orlando Sequera: it comes from they must have.

839
01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:58.330
Orlando Sequera: should have

840
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.570
Orlando Sequera: good half and one half.

841
01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.100
Orlando Sequera: We need to define

842
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:04.530
Orlando Sequera: what's going to be in scope.

843
01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:08.300
Orlando Sequera: Those are the requirements that are going to be making it to the project

844
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:09.219
Orlando Sequera: in.

845
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:14.509
Orlando Sequera: We need to define what requirements are going to be out of scope, at least

846
01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:29.480
Orlando Sequera: at at a particular. This particular moment. Can that change in the future? Yes; but if we're following a predictive approach, this has to be on through following a change control process. That's how we can keep our scope

847
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:42.829
Orlando Sequera: under control. That's how we can prevent something that some of you have mentioned Scope Creek. How do we prevent scope trip by using a change control process that evaluates the impact of changes and approves

848
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.899
Orlando Sequera: it changes or rejects changes.

849
01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:49.519
Orlando Sequera: That's how we keep those changes under control, and we keep.

850
01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:57.889
Orlando Sequera: Let's go. We prevent scope, creep from happening. But this perturbation technique. Some of the requirements are going to be the most halves, and this is

851
01:35:57.970 --> 01:36:00.610
Orlando Sequera: a process that we have to

852
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:19.960
Orlando Sequera: It follow with our stakeholders to make those decisions. Not everything is a must have. We have to prioritize. We need to understand what is a must have. What is that should have? What is it could have? So we can start prioritizing those requirements is commonly used in agile software development.

853
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:27.009
Orlando Sequera: And we also have the Cana model. And this is where we start understanding a. What our

854
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:34.159
Orlando Sequera: the delighters, what are, or excitement the satisfiers, the satisfires, and in different a

855
01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:53.679
Orlando Sequera: categories when it comes to requirements, and the goal is to this is mostly for projects that you're you're taking into account customer satisfaction, loyalty, marketing projects. They widely use this kind of model for their prioritization it. You can also do

856
01:36:54.510 --> 01:37:06.600
Orlando Sequera: a per comparison analysis, and you can compare a alternatives by comparing one against the other, and that works well. If you have a small number of requirements

857
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:11.559
Orlando Sequera: or another common technique that is widely used.

858
01:37:11.670 --> 01:37:28.600
Orlando Sequera: For requirement prior to session is the hunt. The 100 points method is basically a given a 100 points to your stakeholders. That's all they have, and they can spend those points in the requirements. And that's

859
01:37:28.770 --> 01:37:46.099
Orlando Sequera: how we can. And the requirements. I have the most points. Those are going to be the ones that they are going to be given a higher priority compared to the ones that get the list points. It's good to some of the advantages that come with a 100 points. Method is that it's good for any size group, and

860
01:37:46.110 --> 01:38:02.970
Orlando Sequera: even even a large group. It it's it's applicable. It's gonna work, and it gives priority to stakeholder decisions so they can spend their points and the requirements that get the most points. Those are the ones that are going to make it to the scope of the project requirements that have less points. Those are going to be.

861
01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:09.210
Orlando Sequera: Those are not going to be part of the scope of the project. You can think of the scope also as a boundary. Okay.

862
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.910
Orlando Sequera: A.

863
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:14.919
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to

864
01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:23.210
Orlando Sequera: representing data, we have to map that data. As we said before, we have

865
01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:28.230
Orlando Sequera: tons of requirements are going to be making it to your

866
01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.839
Orlando Sequera: They they're making it

867
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:34.599
Orlando Sequera: to the list. And we need to group those those

868
01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:50.289
Orlando Sequera: those requirements. So we had it. We're gonna consolidate the outcome of those brainstorming sessions into a single map, so we can find commonality and differences, and then we can start generate. So we avoid duplication and repetition. So we can start working in

869
01:38:50.300 --> 01:39:02.800
Orlando Sequera: in generating more a requirements. And then the affiliate diagram, we can start. We can set categories a different areas of the project, right. So, for example, for the

870
01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:15.830
Orlando Sequera: and for your software, Accounting software, some areas that are tied up to regulations, some areas, some requirements are tied up to regulations. Some requirements are tied up to

871
01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:18.789
Orlando Sequera: A. For example, reporting

872
01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:35.129
Orlando Sequera: and some requirements are tied up to a it. Infrastructure so different areas. And that's that's an example of an affinity diagram. So we can group them the requirements into categories. So you can classify them and have a better visual.

873
01:39:35.210 --> 01:39:39.149
Orlando Sequera: When a. So you're more strategic about it.

874
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:40.719
Orlando Sequera: all right.

875
01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:46.799
Orlando Sequera: Another tool that you can use to visualize

876
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:49.210
Orlando Sequera: and your

877
01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:54.829
Orlando Sequera: they They not only the requirements, and the scope of your project is

878
01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.950
Orlando Sequera: the context diagram.

879
01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.459
Orlando Sequera: and this can help you with bigger picture.

880
01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:11.460
Orlando Sequera: Remember that what we said before ideally, we should have a holistic approach, and by having a holistic approach we can also uncover requirements for our project.

881
01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.420
Orlando Sequera: One way of doing that.

882
01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:19.890
Orlando Sequera: Let's assume that our project is, for example, to create a new

883
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:30.459
Orlando Sequera: registration, a student registration system for a university. Okay, okay. So that is our project. But let's look at the bigger picture. That's another

884
01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:37.869
Orlando Sequera: following this approach or the context diagram can help us to uncover requirements as well. And let's look at a bigger picture. So

885
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:49.380
Orlando Sequera: we're building a new. We we're gonna develop a new student registration system for a university. But let's look at the bigger picture. What? How is the university related to other

886
01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:54.329
Orlando Sequera: to other areas? Let's build a context diagram right? So

887
01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:57.920
Orlando Sequera: he has ties to the government.

888
01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.009
Orlando Sequera: He has ties to the private sector. He has ties to the user community, and that's where we have

889
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:08.860
Orlando Sequera: professors and students mainly, and administration.

890
01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:19.300
Orlando Sequera: He has ties to the industry, and it also has ties to the education community by doing that by having that holistic approach we can start uncovering a

891
01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.090
Orlando Sequera: the relationships

892
01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:22.050
Orlando Sequera: in

893
01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:40.270
Orlando Sequera: start, seeing that even though we're building this new student registration system, this might have impacts in other areas that we might have not been able to uncover before, and that drives new requirements. And so we need to look at the bigger picture as well. That's what

894
01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:54.539
Orlando Sequera: That's the beauty of a context diagram. It can help us to uncover relationships that can translate into possible requirements for our products. So, looking at the bigger picture, how do we do that with a context? Diagram

895
01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.860
Orlando Sequera: in some cases

896
01:41:58.810 --> 01:41:59.800
Orlando Sequera: is.

897
01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:03.269
Orlando Sequera: And this happens a lot

898
01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:07.380
Orlando Sequera: in software development. For example, it's really hard to get people

899
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:08.370
Orlando Sequera: to

900
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:22.690
Orlando Sequera: verbalize what they're expecting to see in a software application especially because it's something Most people are visual. Most people need to have something tangible in front of them. So sometimes

901
01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.380
Orlando Sequera: you can

902
01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:38.789
Orlando Sequera: follow this approach of create a prototype. For example, we're developing the we we're having a hard time with our users. Let's assume for a minute that we're having a hard time with our users providing feedback and input about what are the features. So they want to see

903
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:55.720
Orlando Sequera: in this accounting software we we have been able to determine that we're not getting really a lot of input on the requirements. That that's a major. No, no. So we have to do something. Okay, let's work on preparing a prototype about the software that

904
01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.580
Orlando Sequera: that we can show to them in a, in a relatively

905
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:09.069
Orlando Sequera: in in in quickly, that we can relatively quickly show them something so they can start, see, and so they can general report.

906
01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:12.650
Orlando Sequera: Of course, let them know. This is based on what we know.

907
01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:21.350
Orlando Sequera: We came up with this prototype, and we would like you, Mr. Mrs. Customer to provide input on this

908
01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:22.550
Orlando Sequera: prototype.

909
01:43:22.710 --> 01:43:25.300
Orlando Sequera: and most people in that.

910
01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:33.320
Orlando Sequera: I've done it multiple times for many teams when they most people are visual when they have something tangible in front of them.

911
01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:43.800
Orlando Sequera: It's like they they. The gates are open flood gates right now. They start. Oh, we don't like that color. No, that's that phone is not correct. No, that's a that.

912
01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:50.879
Orlando Sequera: That's not what. How we want to see the the report. No, we need this. We need. We need that field. We need this.

913
01:43:51.250 --> 01:44:11.099
Orlando Sequera: Got it incorrect. So when you show exactly what they don't want that's when they start talking and you want your stakeholders to talk. That's how you gather requirements. Very powerful, simple, yet powerful, is widely using predictive and and hybrid projects. But it's one way, another way, another

914
01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:16.369
Orlando Sequera: tool and technique that you have available in your toolkit to gather requirements.

915
01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.019
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

916
01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:19.099
Orlando Sequera: A:

917
01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:21.990
Orlando Sequera: The scope management plan.

918
01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:26.149
Orlando Sequera: This is great. This is a a

919
01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:34.850
Orlando Sequera: one of the most important plans that you have in your project. So we talked about the requirements mentioned plan. Scope is so important that we have 2 plans for scope.

920
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:35.960
Orlando Sequera: 2 plants.

921
01:44:36.150 --> 01:44:45.030
Orlando Sequera: one specific for requirements that are the foundation of the scope, and then we have one specific for scope. This is going to help us to

922
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:54.470
Orlando Sequera: review this scope activities, and how the work is going to be done, because ultimately that's the scope of the work it. This has

923
01:44:54.690 --> 01:45:00.159
Orlando Sequera: the processes that we need to follow. To prepare a pros of statement is going to give you

924
01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:05.889
Orlando Sequera: the green light to start working on creating this work breakdown structure

925
01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:09.250
Orlando Sequera: room that detailed for this

926
01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:20.319
Orlando Sequera: is also going to establish how this code, baseline and the scope baseline, is the approved version of your scope that is only going to be changing

927
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:22.240
Orlando Sequera: through change, control.

928
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:32.990
Orlando Sequera: a change control process. It's going to tell you how that's going to be changing the rules of the scope in this case, and it's also going to specify how formal acceptance

929
01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.109
Orlando Sequera: of project delivers are going to be obtained, and there's not a set way of doing, of

930
01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:49.790
Orlando Sequera: creating the scope mentioned plan. This can be formal, a, or it can be very detailed. It's it's pretty much up to the organization up to your project. It changes

931
01:45:49.810 --> 01:46:06.649
Orlando Sequera: from organization to organization. So this is the strategy that we're going to follow to manage the scope which is the work that we have to come to complete in our project. But I also want you to think of the scope as a boundary. Right? What's in scope?

932
01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:12.539
Orlando Sequera: That's what we have to produce with our project, but some requirements are going to be out of scope.

933
01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:19.800
Orlando Sequera: We don't have to to to to build those requirements. That's why we prioritize, and that's why we select what's in scope.

934
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:27.439
Orlando Sequera: That's what we have to build. So for the example of the house we have to build a house with a metal roof, and for

935
01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.719
Orlando Sequera: for, and not

936
01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:38.860
Orlando Sequera: an and and not that roof with a Spanish shingles or or shingles right? So

937
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:39.769
Orlando Sequera: that's

938
01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.010
Orlando Sequera: that's what we have in scope. So I want you to think of scope as a boundary as well.

939
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:51.339
Orlando Sequera: The Project Cup statement after we collected our project requirements.

940
01:46:51.510 --> 01:47:01.230
Orlando Sequera: the next step is for you to prepare your project. Scope statement. This is a document that includes all the requirements as specified

941
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.160
Orlando Sequera: for the scope of the project.

942
01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.510
Orlando Sequera: and this is an outcome.

943
01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:11.310
Orlando Sequera: an output. I'm: sorry, and i'll put off the plans code process. Okay.

944
01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:18.349
Orlando Sequera: A: what do we have in most projects of statement? We have a description of the project and product.

945
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:27.600
Orlando Sequera: We're going to have acceptance criteria. We're going to have the deliverables that need to be produced in any out of scope items

946
01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:35.250
Orlando Sequera: what is out of scope, so that that are needed for clarification. Remember, not all requirements are going to make it

947
01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:46.979
Orlando Sequera: to the project are going to be part of this couple of projects. Some requirements are going to be out of scope. Some requirements are going to be in scope, and it's also going to list your limitations or constraints and

948
01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:54.660
Orlando Sequera: your assumptions. And, as I mentioned before, and by the way, this is for predicted projects.

949
01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.800
Orlando Sequera: once the scope has been approved.

950
01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:01.749
Orlando Sequera: That's when we create our scope, baseline.

951
01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:08.470
Orlando Sequera: and that is the approved version of the scope, and it's only going to be changing

952
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:27.180
Orlando Sequera: through a change control process. That's how we prevent scope, creep, scope, creep is uncontrolled change. We don't want that. We don't want that change is okay, but it has to be control on control screen on control, change. It's a recipe for destruction. Okay.

953
01:48:27.190 --> 01:48:31.990
Orlando Sequera: changes have to be controlled and we use a change control process for that.

954
01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:39.579
Orlando Sequera: and approved changes are going to be incorporated to the scope. But we have the scope is a is

955
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:44.580
Orlando Sequera: Think of it, As I mentioned before, as an actual boundary.

956
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.940
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

957
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:59.130
Orlando Sequera: some of the tools and techniques that we use for scope planning. We have to review documentation. We have to use document analysis. We have to use alternative analysis. We use product analysis.

958
01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:11.949
Orlando Sequera: and we look at pro requirements from existing documents, and probably the most important one here is expertise as expert judgment. Ask your subject matter experts

959
01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:31.099
Orlando Sequera: in the project team, and if they're not in the project team, you can go outside of the product team. But you need to get this expertise, even if it's outside of the organization. So ask questions about the product service of result. So you can understand, use characteristics in any other relevant aspects. That is

960
01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:33.269
Orlando Sequera: crucial for you to be successful

961
01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.300
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

962
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.300
Orlando Sequera: a

963
01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:46.050
Orlando Sequera: document, analysis, a alternative analysis. They're going to help you to.

964
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:48.299
Orlando Sequera: Oh, by the way, by the way.

965
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:52.720
Orlando Sequera: this here, this what we have here.

966
01:49:53.630 --> 01:50:03.330
Orlando Sequera: this what we have here is one type of question that you might get in your Pmp. Exam, which is the match making you have to. You're going to have

967
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.559
Orlando Sequera: boxes in one site and then you're gonna have

968
01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.350
Orlando Sequera: options in another column

969
01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:20.770
Orlando Sequera: in your right side. For example, here one type of question that you might get in your Pmp. Exam. Might be exactly like this. So you have to match

970
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:22.090
Orlando Sequera: this

971
01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:30.540
Orlando Sequera: options document, analysis, alternative analysis, product, analysis, and expert judgment to what you have in the right. So document analysis

972
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:40.060
Orlando Sequera: is going to derive new product requirements from existing documents. Alternative analysis is used to consider possible potential options

973
01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:43.779
Orlando Sequera: or approaches to execute and perform the project work.

974
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:46.020
Orlando Sequera: Then product analysis.

975
01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:56.940
Orlando Sequera: ask questions about a product and form answers to this type. Use characteristics relevant, and then with expert judgment, you will have

976
01:50:57.050 --> 01:51:09.669
Orlando Sequera: to analyze information in it, to develop and the products of statement and any technical detail. So that's the type of question that you might get in your Pmp: Exam: this is just an example.

977
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:10.420
Okay.

978
01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:14.710
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to product analysis

979
01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:19.870
Orlando Sequera: methods. And this is useful. If you are developing

980
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:31.219
Orlando Sequera: a product with your project, you're building a new I from we're building a new car. So you want to break down the product into the requirements so you can have an understanding of the work.

981
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:39.980
Orlando Sequera: You might use systems, engineering systems, analysis, requirements, analysis, value, engineering. Okay.

982
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:41.690
Orlando Sequera: So

983
01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:44.650
okay.

984
01:51:44.710 --> 01:51:47.209
Orlando Sequera: So we are going to take

985
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.280
Orlando Sequera: a break. Now, when we come back from break

986
01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:53.030
Orlando Sequera: we are going to

987
01:51:53.350 --> 01:52:01.889
Orlando Sequera: address some questions and then continue. So we're going to take a 10 min break. When we come back from break we're going to address a few questions, and we'll continue

988
01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:02.620
Orlando Sequera: all right.

989
01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.529
Orlando Sequera: Enjoy your break will be by

990
01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:13.650
Orlando Sequera: which Mark, in a second

991
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:20.069
Orlando Sequera: my apologies, benchmarking is a comparison

992
01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:27.619
Orlando Sequera: comparing to other projects and a comparing, even in some cases to other, to best practice in the industry.

993
01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:30.949
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

994
01:52:31.050 --> 01:52:31.610
Okay.

995
01:52:39.230 --> 01:52:42.950
Orlando Sequera: We went over the difference and between project and product scope.

996
01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:55.859
Orlando Sequera: Another question. You use a house as a project. If you're building a 20 house development, will the development of the scope and each individual has be a product.

997
01:52:58.760 --> 01:52:59.510
Orlando Sequera: Well.

998
01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:03.430
Orlando Sequera: you each individual has to be a project

999
01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:09.759
Orlando Sequera: it's possible to have. Each individual has to be a project, especially if they're different models. You can look at it

1000
01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:11.440
Orlando Sequera: it like that.

1001
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:29.080
Orlando Sequera: Any relatable example of fixed crop approach construction.

1002
01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.889
Orlando Sequera: construction projects.

1003
01:53:34.530 --> 01:53:44.210
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between master and and increments. A maston is a significant event in the project. Building in increments is adding functionality As we progress in the project.

1004
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:52.019
Orlando Sequera: How can we control scope, creep through change control

1005
01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.589
Orlando Sequera: for through a change control process in predictive.

1006
01:53:55.630 --> 01:53:57.820
Orlando Sequera: If we're following a predictive approach.

1007
01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:11.609
Orlando Sequera: how that's the type of contracting from the scope we're gonna get to contracts. When we talk about procurement we'll talk about that later.

1008
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:17.100
Orlando Sequera: Is there any technique for defining scope? That's

1009
01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:23.490
Orlando Sequera: That's what we we have. We have to prioritize the scope. So we went over those techniques already.

1010
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:30.109
Orlando Sequera: All right, so we're going to continue with the class, and

1011
01:54:30.190 --> 01:54:32.839
Orlando Sequera: we'll try to do our best to address

1012
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:34.599
Orlando Sequera: a

1013
01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:39.700
Orlando Sequera: to address some of the questions, and

1014
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.730
Orlando Sequera: we're going to continue with the class.

1015
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:45.069
Orlando Sequera: and that the next

1016
01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:56.519
Orlando Sequera: step in defining our scope super important. And this is for predicted projects. Okay, You see the symbol here. Whenever you see the symbol that means that you have

1017
01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:58.500
Orlando Sequera: a that it is.

1018
01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:01.810
Orlando Sequera: and we're talking about predictive. All right.

1019
01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.240
Orlando Sequera: This is really really important.

1020
01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:17.259
Orlando Sequera: This is an important part of the scope, because we're going to define the entire the entire scope. We we're going to represent it, using the work, breakdown structure.

1021
01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:18.620
Orlando Sequera: and

1022
01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:21.729
Orlando Sequera: the word breakdown structure comes from

1023
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:25.420
Orlando Sequera: a very old principle of dividing and conquering.

1024
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:35.029
Orlando Sequera: Imagine the scope of your project as a big boulder. It's a big boulder that okay, we have to build

1025
01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:42.370
Orlando Sequera: a one-story house, and they might. They might sound very straightforward. But imagine

1026
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:43.950
Orlando Sequera: so. Where do we start?

1027
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.179
Orlando Sequera: Where do we start? How how do we do that? We're

1028
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.040
Orlando Sequera: can, how can we? How can we be as efficient

1029
01:55:52.070 --> 01:56:10.289
Orlando Sequera: as possible with the resources that we have. We know the scope, we know the requirements. It is a house, a we we understand the exterior wall requirements, the roof, the foundation requirements, the interior, a structure, requirements, the plumbing, the wiring.

1030
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:15.939
Orlando Sequera: We understand all the requirements that we have to meet with the we there are due diligence in

1031
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:35.880
Orlando Sequera: we in collecting those requirements. But now, how do we? How do we start working? Ha, ha! How do we start working on that project. Where, where do we start? How do we? How do we do that? So that's where the war breakdown structure comes into play. Imagine the scope as a big boulder, for now let's break it into smaller chunks.

1032
01:56:36.230 --> 01:56:51.209
Orlando Sequera: Let's break that scope down into smaller chunks. So we start at the top of the War Practice structure. That's the project level. Usually we have to the project name and the prima delivery. Right? Deliver a one story house

1033
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.259
Orlando Sequera: in Xyc location. Okay.

1034
01:56:56.150 --> 01:56:59.929
Orlando Sequera: Then we have a lower level. We start

1035
01:57:00.170 --> 01:57:05.340
Orlando Sequera: decomposing. We start dividing and concrete that scope into multiple areas.

1036
01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:09.290
Orlando Sequera: Then we have what we call a management control point.

1037
01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:19.460
Orlando Sequera: So we can then integrate the scope, and we can have multiple areas. For example, an example of this control account. A level will be okay. Let's divide

1038
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:21.369
Orlando Sequera: our house.

1039
01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:22.760
Orlando Sequera: the scope of our

1040
01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:28.679
Orlando Sequera: project of building a house into different areas. One area has to do with the roof right.

1041
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:31.569
Orlando Sequera: Another area will be

1042
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:38.249
Orlando Sequera: structure, internal structure, external structure, another area, maybe foundation.

1043
01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:41.009
Orlando Sequera: Another area may be landscaping.

1044
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:45.410
Orlando Sequera: for example, so multiple areas. So we're dividing that's code

1045
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:52.859
Orlando Sequera: into areas. And then under that we can start dividing those areas into smaller chunks.

1046
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:54.830
Orlando Sequera: So we can have

1047
01:57:55.630 --> 01:57:57.019
Orlando Sequera: a under

1048
01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:09.949
Orlando Sequera: a structure. For example, we have internal structure external structure, and then we can decompose that. And that's where we start seeing the plumbing, that's when we start seeing a

1049
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:19.259
Orlando Sequera: under the foundation, we start seeing we might add the floors under that. And what needs to happen internally? By the way, i'm not a construction project manager, but

1050
01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.619
Orlando Sequera: just it. It's a very easy way to visualize that breakdown.

1051
01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:33.690
Orlando Sequera: and ultimately that decomposition of those different areas of the scope we're going to get to the lowest

1052
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:38.870
Orlando Sequera: to the lowest component, which is what we call the war package.

1053
01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:40.179
Orlando Sequera: And

1054
01:58:40.930 --> 01:58:45.149
Orlando Sequera: I work package. Let's assume that we're decomposing the area of

1055
01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:56.140
Orlando Sequera: a external structures, and we have in external walls, and we decompose that. That's that's where we have. We're going to have there.

1056
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:05.029
Orlando Sequera: under that. We're gonna have one component. That is a windows, and another component that is, or external windows and external doors. Right?

1057
01:59:05.210 --> 01:59:07.480
Orlando Sequera: So that's another component. But

1058
01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:21.890
Orlando Sequera: can we decompose that a little bit more that it will be an example. Not really. That will be an example of a word. Package that window, that door, that external window, and external door. So under

1059
01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.249
Orlando Sequera: those board packages.

1060
01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:27.090
Orlando Sequera: What we are going to have is

1061
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:34.930
Orlando Sequera: actions that we have to complete in order to produce those war packages. That is the smallest

1062
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:38.129
Orlando Sequera: level of the word breakdown structure.

1063
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:49.900
Orlando Sequera: And by the way, decomposing those 4 packages into actions or activities. That's how we create the list of activities that we need to complete

1064
01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.779
Orlando Sequera: in order to

1065
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:55.470
Orlando Sequera: complete our project, because we're gonna roll that up

1066
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:57.870
Orlando Sequera: from that lowest level

1067
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:09.599
Orlando Sequera: to the top. And when you roll all that up. That's how you are going to be able to understand the list of activities that you have to complete in order to deliver your

1068
02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:17.269
Orlando Sequera: entire project. For example for the window we have. What do we have under that word package? Well, we have

1069
02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:33.510
Orlando Sequera: to measure the window. We have to either purchase the window or install the window, and then we have to test the window. We deliver the window. Notice a couple of things when it comes to board packages it's usually. Now it's window door

1070
02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.519
Orlando Sequera: frame. Those are board packages. That's how we express word packages.

1071
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.650
Orlando Sequera: Then

1072
02:00:39.710 --> 02:00:41.679
Orlando Sequera: the actions under

1073
02:00:42.210 --> 02:00:45.469
Orlando Sequera: those were packages. Those are project activities.

1074
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:54.899
Orlando Sequera: Measure the window, install the window, purchase the window, test the window. Those are the project activities. Okay, that's where the product activities come from.

1075
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:59.190
Orlando Sequera: They don't come out of thin air. They come from this decomposition.

1076
02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.920
Orlando Sequera: A

1077
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:04.110
Orlando Sequera: A few aspects that we have to take into account

1078
02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:13.040
Orlando Sequera: have to follow the 100% rule. Everything has to be taken into account when it comes to the scope, and we want to use a hierarchical approach

1079
02:01:13.110 --> 02:01:27.659
Orlando Sequera: to divide and conquer that scope. That's the beauty of the war breakdown structure in construction this is widely used. You might be wondering what about planning packages? What do we have planning packages? In some cases

1080
02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:39.169
Orlando Sequera: we might, due to our expert knowledge expert judgement that we get from the team. We might have some cases in which we need to

1081
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:50.009
Orlando Sequera: plan for some work that we know that it's gonna be coming so we can create it's a placeholder. A planning package is a placeholder. So you can definitely use that into

1082
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.450
Orlando Sequera: a your

1083
02:01:51.790 --> 02:02:01.560
Orlando Sequera: when you're building the war practice structure. But this is a graphic representation of your entire scope. You divide and conquer into smaller chunks

1084
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.690
Orlando Sequera: and

1085
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:21.770
Orlando Sequera: to the lowest level, which is the word package. And then you roll that up under the war package. You have the list of activities that you have to complete those actions that you have to complete in your project, and you roll that up, and that's how you understand all the activities that you have to complete in order to deliver your project.

1086
02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:25.620
Orlando Sequera: Hey? That's how it works. If we're following a predictive approach.

1087
02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:31.449
Orlando Sequera: decomposition is the key aspect when it comes to

1088
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:47.790
Orlando Sequera: creating the war, break the instruction that's the technique that we use is divide and conquer, divide, and subdivide into smaller, more manageable parts. So we they, instead of having that big boulder, we have smaller rocks that we can then work on, and then address

1089
02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:59.509
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna help you to identify the tasks or they work that needs to be done those actions it's going to help you to structure and organize this wbs or breakdown structure, and

1090
02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:02.929
Orlando Sequera: in a more efficient way.

1091
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:10.560
Orlando Sequera: You can decompose high levels, code components into low level scope components. You can start assigning a

1092
02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:29.340
Orlando Sequera: unique identification code. You, if you have ever used a software like Microsoft Project. You're gonna start seeing some numbers. 1 point, 1 point, 1 1 point, 1 point, 2. You can aside specific number control account numbers, so you can then keep track of the different

1093
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:31.410
Orlando Sequera: aspects of your scope

1094
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:32.469
Orlando Sequera: in.

1095
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:44.559
Orlando Sequera: This is also going to help you to review the the composition of those word packages to make sure that they are aligned with project requirements. You can have to validate this against your project requirements 150.

1096
02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:47.299
Orlando Sequera: That is really important. But

1097
02:03:47.320 --> 02:04:03.709
Orlando Sequera: since this is a large imagine, if you have you're working even in in the project of building a one-story house. This can be very a. It can be very large. It can be very convoluted. You might have multiple areas that you have to address is a lot of information

1098
02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:30.380
Orlando Sequera: for someone that is not familiar with the project. If you just show them that wbs, it's never really going to make more more much sense. What do you mean by 1 point, 1 point, 1, 1, 1 point, 1 point, 2 a roof. A. Wh. How is this going to help me? So for that reason. Whenever you create a word breakdown structure, you also need to create something that is called the word Browser Structure Dictionary.

1099
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.410
Orlando Sequera: This is

1100
02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.480
Orlando Sequera: a

1101
02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:46.189
Orlando Sequera: a document that is gonna come with your Wbs. That is going to explain what those numbers mean. The 1 point, 1 1, 1 point, 1 point, 2. It's gonna include that. It's going to include the description of the work.

1102
02:04:46.220 --> 02:05:00.799
Orlando Sequera: It's also going to include the assumptions and limitations. The responsible organization scheduled milestones going to be contained here. All the associated schedule activities cost estimations whenever they become available.

1103
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:10.050
Orlando Sequera: while it requirements technical reference and a an agreement information. So you always gonna have those a that document coming

1104
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:19.079
Orlando Sequera: together with your Wbs because it's impossible to put everything together in one document. So you have the Wbs. The breakdown of the scope

1105
02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:31.809
Orlando Sequera: with the corresponding Wbs Dictionary, plus your scope statement. And those are the 3 elements that form your project scope. Okay, that are part of your scope, baseline.

1106
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:33.529
Orlando Sequera: and then

1107
02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:40.660
Orlando Sequera: that takes us to the approved version of the scope. It is, as I mentioned before, your scope. Baseline is

1108
02:05:40.890 --> 02:05:44.599
Orlando Sequera: the approved version of the sc of statement. Element number one

1109
02:05:44.650 --> 02:05:57.830
Orlando Sequera: element, number 2, the Wbs with the corresponding Wbs Dictionary or Element number 3. Those are the 3 elements that form the scope baseline. They can only be change

1110
02:05:57.890 --> 02:06:00.799
Orlando Sequera: following a change control process.

1111
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:01.610
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1112
02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:19.580
Orlando Sequera: And that is the approved version of your scope. And here you have your scope Statement. Your Wbs: Your word packages. Of course that's part of the Wbs. You might have planning packages that are part of the Wbs and the corresponding dictionary. This is only going to change

1113
02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:22.519
Orlando Sequera: through change control process.

1114
02:06:23.170 --> 02:06:24.000
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1115
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:25.139
Orlando Sequera: Important

1116
02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:28.480
Orlando Sequera: A:

1117
02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:36.099
Orlando Sequera: You also have to take into account. Once you complete your project, you also have to take into account

1118
02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:46.110
Orlando Sequera: transition. That's also part of this couple of your work. You may have transition, if requirement. You're going to be doing a hand over. When your project is.

1119
02:06:46.190 --> 02:07:01.239
Orlando Sequera: it is deployed to production, only becomes life right when you deliver the house is given. You give the case to to the customer. The house is completed, so there might be some transition requirements we can. We have to take this into account. This

1120
02:07:01.250 --> 02:07:11.180
Orlando Sequera: This is not necessarily going to happen always at the end. This might happen a. Throughout the life cycle of the project, and a few questions that you can ask

1121
02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:15.059
Orlando Sequera: that we're going to help you to understand that. Is this going to be something new.

1122
02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:19.970
Orlando Sequera: or is it an update to the business environment? Are we transitioning

1123
02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:27.330
Orlando Sequera: to a live environment do we have to decommission legacy systems it the we perform

1124
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:37.500
Orlando Sequera: training and knowledge transfer accordingly. Right? So asked a few questions, Don't. In some cases this is applicable. In some cases it's not going to be applicable.

1125
02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:39.660
Orlando Sequera: And

1126
02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:49.389
Orlando Sequera: how do we do scope planning in adaptive environment? Right? If we're following an agile approach. So now we're switching from

1127
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:52.589
Orlando Sequera: addictive to adaptive. How do we do that

1128
02:07:52.810 --> 02:07:56.139
Orlando Sequera: we use? As we said before.

1129
02:07:56.460 --> 02:08:02.990
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna be using an incremental and iterative development and user stories. That's

1130
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:14.430
Orlando Sequera: another. That's an alternative to the way we look at requirements. In predictive, we have a plethora of types of requirements. We have multiple types of requirements

1131
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.450
Orlando Sequera: in

1132
02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:23.779
Orlando Sequera: adaptive environments. We only have one type of requirement that is presented in the form of a user story.

1133
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:25.549
Orlando Sequera: They are

1134
02:08:25.590 --> 02:08:40.040
Orlando Sequera: a short description toll from the perspective of the customer about the functionality. That's the only type of requirement that we are going to. That that we're going to be paying attention to

1135
02:08:40.050 --> 02:08:48.489
Orlando Sequera: is in that regard. It's very different from predictive. We look at user. Stories. That's how we write requirements in agile and

1136
02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:51.179
Orlando Sequera: though producing and building

1137
02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:54.359
Orlando Sequera: those user stories. That's how we

1138
02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:58.110
Orlando Sequera: That's how we do it in agile

1139
02:08:59.390 --> 02:09:06.400
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to planning. And remember that in adaptive projects we're following this approach because

1140
02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:07.639
Orlando Sequera: we knew

1141
02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.179
Orlando Sequera: before we start the project that the scope was going to be changing. The scope is not fixed.

1142
02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:19.400
Orlando Sequera: This scope is going to be changing, so we need an approach. We need an approach that was flexible in that regard.

1143
02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:26.769
Orlando Sequera: We need our projects for someone in that regard. That's why we know, going in that the scope is going to be changing, and therefore

1144
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:44.839
Orlando Sequera: we need a flexible approach. But we still need to plan for our scope right? We is not there. There. There has to be some a. We have to be strategic about the way we produce the functionality in our project. So we do some planning we do planning

1145
02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:50.810
Orlando Sequera: at the iteration level at the spring level we decide with the team

1146
02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:57.649
Orlando Sequera: and the owner. What are the features? What are the user stories that are going to be built in a particular iteration.

1147
02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:05.340
Orlando Sequera: and the team makes a commitment. That's what happens in iteration in the iteration planning.

1148
02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:12.860
Orlando Sequera: They're going to estimate the level of effort, and they're going themselves to determine the tasks that are need

1149
02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:21.840
Orlando Sequera: that they need to complete in order to produce those user stories or requirements, and they ask questions and they start. They work in the iteration.

1150
02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:22.670
Orlando Sequera: But

1151
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:28.670
Orlando Sequera: a release is usually a combination of multiple iterations.

1152
02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:40.249
Orlando Sequera: and what organizations do is they try to combine similar functionality? For example, they They want to make sure that security is addressed for

1153
02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:56.039
Orlando Sequera: this application, then they can combine a release. Okay, we have 6 or 7 iterations that are in which the team is working. On developing security related features. Then we're. Let's combine that into our release, and that's how. And we can

1154
02:10:56.050 --> 02:11:03.629
Orlando Sequera: we're going to release that in in 3 months, for example, is just an example. Then everything that gets all those

1155
02:11:03.930 --> 02:11:05.139
Orlando Sequera: a

1156
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:07.780
Orlando Sequera: user stories that were

1157
02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:23.719
Orlando Sequera: developed by the team that were produced by the team are going to be released together because they are related to security. So that's what we do at the release planning level. We try to group strategic similar functionality. So it gets released at the same time.

1158
02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:25.490
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1159
02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:36.480
Orlando Sequera: they backlogs. We keep talking about the backlogs. The proto backlog is the equivalent of the war breakdown structure.

1160
02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:38.010
Orlando Sequera: In predictive

1161
02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:44.469
Orlando Sequera: the pro backlog is the equivalent to the word breakdown structure in predictive

1162
02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:46.859
Orlando Sequera: it is a container.

1163
02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:52.390
Orlando Sequera: It is a container that. And what do we have inside of that container? We have

1164
02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:54.320
Orlando Sequera: a

1165
02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:59.979
Orlando Sequera: We have multiple elements, and those elements are the user stories their requirements.

1166
02:12:00.010 --> 02:12:04.790
Orlando Sequera: That's what the team has to develop. If we're following an added approach.

1167
02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:21.489
Orlando Sequera: the product owner is that liaison between the business and the agile team that is in charge of the protocol? It's the individual that is going to create the per backlog. Why is that? Because they are very familiar with the scope they're going to add

1168
02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:44.789
Orlando Sequera: user stories. They're gonna work in in collaboration with the team and other stakeholders. They're going to provide clarification to the team. And more importantly, they're going to prioritize the product backlog to make sure that the user stories or features that at the most value are always at the top. That's what we mean by prioritization. And this is done based on value.

1169
02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.490
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1170
02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.829
Orlando Sequera: the programmer and the team are going to collaborate to move

1171
02:12:49.020 --> 02:13:07.449
Orlando Sequera: work items to the iteration or spring backlog. We have another backlog that is smaller. It's what we call the iteration backlog. This is just for a particular iteration. It's a smaller container compared to the pro backlog. All the user stories for that need to be developed for the project.

1172
02:13:08.130 --> 02:13:11.779
Orlando Sequera: Iteration backlogs more container just for those

1173
02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:27.860
Orlando Sequera: 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks. that the team is going to be working on developing that function of what happens in iteration of spring planning is that the team is gonna take some user stories from the big container or for backlog, and they're gonna put it in the small

1174
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:36.819
Orlando Sequera: container or iteration backlog, or spring backlog, and that's what they're going to build in that particular iteration or sprint.

1175
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:41.909
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so those are the 2 types of backlog. Remember, Big Backlog.

1176
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:48.410
Orlando Sequera: that is the prot backlog small backlog. That is the iteration or spring backlog. They.

1177
02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:57.270
Orlando Sequera: the product backlog is the equivalent to the war breakdown structure in predictive. That's how we manage this scope. In our

1178
02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.669
Orlando Sequera: add your project.

1179
02:14:00.730 --> 02:14:01.889
Orlando Sequera: and

1180
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:04.849
Orlando Sequera: additionally, we also have.

1181
02:14:05.330 --> 02:14:20.620
Orlando Sequera: We have user stories. We have story maps. We can group those user stories in a way that they can help us to be strategic and to manage the scope and start a combining those user stories

1182
02:14:20.630 --> 02:14:40.209
Orlando Sequera: with similarities and be strategic about the way that these are released to our customers. So a a story map is one way to organize this user stories. Remember user stories. I want you to associate that with requirements in agile. Okay, so we can group a start training functional groups

1183
02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:44.770
Orlando Sequera: that can help us in building this per roadmap, and they are helpful

1184
02:14:44.850 --> 02:14:57.980
Orlando Sequera: in. This is one way using the story map technique. And this is one way to understand this cover and prioritize the product and our way moving forward. This is one technique.

1185
02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:00.060
Orlando Sequera: We can also.

1186
02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:02.079
Orlando Sequera: in many cases

1187
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:06.730
Orlando Sequera: combine multiple user stories.

1188
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:08.300
Orlando Sequera: A. I

1189
02:15:08.410 --> 02:15:09.460
Orlando Sequera: in

1190
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:11.389
Orlando Sequera: when we have to deliver

1191
02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:26.279
Orlando Sequera: complex functionality. The same principle that we use in predictive of dividing and conquering. That's also applicable Here we're going to have some functionality, some some requirements, some features that we have to build with the radial team that are complex.

1192
02:15:26.290 --> 02:15:31.760
Orlando Sequera: that I have a high level of complexity. For example, that monthly sales report

1193
02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:35.899
Orlando Sequera: to build a monthly sales report for the accounting software. That

1194
02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:43.949
Orlando Sequera: is a complex piece of functionality. The recommendation is to break that down into smaller chunks

1195
02:15:44.370 --> 02:15:50.519
Orlando Sequera: into smaller user stories. And because that combination of multiple user stories

1196
02:15:50.610 --> 02:15:57.850
Orlando Sequera: are going to produce that monthly sales report and those multiple user stories

1197
02:15:58.670 --> 02:16:02.090
Orlando Sequera: are an example of what we call in

1198
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:04.529
Orlando Sequera: in agile, we call

1199
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:06.489
Orlando Sequera: epic and epic.

1200
02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:17.929
Orlando Sequera: That is a major deliverable. That monthly sales report can be considered a major deliverable I a level of complexity, but dividing and conquering list.

1201
02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:35.959
Orlando Sequera: use the same approach that we use in predictive. Divide that into smaller chunks. So the team has a better chance to be successful in delivering that functionality. You might be wondering Why is that? Well, because that report chances are that it's sitting on the report. It's going to be a fed by other reports.

1202
02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:54.309
Orlando Sequera: The report for that, Accounting software so it's complex. The team. If you leave it. If it's only one big chunk, it's it's gonna be very complex. You should divide and conquer. That's a major recommendation a into smaller user stories. So then you group them together.

1203
02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:57.590
Orlando Sequera: That's going to be an epic, and that's going to help your team

1204
02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:05.290
Orlando Sequera: to increase their chances of being successful. So a combination, a collection of multiple use of stories that we call an epic.

1205
02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:06.629
Okay.

1206
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:08.400
Orlando Sequera: let's see.

1207
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:16.129
Orlando Sequera: As we have said, the product backlog, right? It keeps

1208
02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:22.570
Orlando Sequera: it's a it's a running list. It's. A it's a to-do list that's what it is to do list of what of user stories

1209
02:17:22.799 --> 02:17:37.780
Orlando Sequera: some user stories might disappear. So i'm use this new user story might be at it. It's always changing. It's always changing, but it needs to be prioritized at all times. It needs to be prioritized by the

1210
02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:39.139
Orlando Sequera: product owner.

1211
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:43.469
Orlando Sequera: Here is where the scrum master is going to help

1212
02:17:43.770 --> 02:17:49.899
Orlando Sequera: the product owner. They, the the from master, serves not only their team members. They also serve

1213
02:17:50.100 --> 02:18:05.369
Orlando Sequera: the product owner, helping them. Okay, not because that individual was designated as a per owner. They know exactly what they need to do. They are familiar with the scope, but they might not be necessarily familiar with adjunct practices or scrum practices.

1214
02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:10.620
Orlando Sequera: They need help that help is going to come from the scrum master.

1215
02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:18.789
Orlando Sequera: And this is key, because if the backlog is not prioritized, meaning that the user stories that at the most value are at the top.

1216
02:18:18.879 --> 02:18:26.420
Orlando Sequera: Then we're going to be in trouble. So this is something that needs to be done. It's a continual process

1217
02:18:26.490 --> 02:18:35.579
Orlando Sequera: that that is done by the product owner prior to iteration planning. So, before we plan our iteration, our per backlog has to be prioritized.

1218
02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:45.890
Orlando Sequera: You might have some additional refinement that is done during the spring and iteration with the team. This is going to help you to reorganize and we prioritize the work

1219
02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:49.100
Orlando Sequera: to in order to complete higher priority

1220
02:18:49.129 --> 02:18:53.319
Orlando Sequera: items or user stories that deliver value first

1221
02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:54.990
Orlando Sequera: to our customer.

1222
02:18:55.080 --> 02:19:02.470
Orlando Sequera: and the recommendation is to split epics complex functionally into smaller user stories.

1223
02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:03.680
Orlando Sequera: All right

1224
02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:10.480
Orlando Sequera: if we are going to

1225
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:12.280
a

1226
02:19:14.670 --> 02:19:17.069
Orlando Sequera: I want to ask you a question.

1227
02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:19.330
Orlando Sequera: The chat is now open.

1228
02:19:19.459 --> 02:19:20.389
Orlando Sequera: A.

1229
02:19:20.490 --> 02:19:22.510
Orlando Sequera: What are the 2 stakeholders?

1230
02:19:22.530 --> 02:19:32.269
Orlando Sequera: This is a small quiz what 2 stakeholders need to be a part of the proscope planning what? Which 2 soldiers, which 2 stakeholders performed the proscope planning

1231
02:19:45.709 --> 02:19:46.580
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1232
02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:49.639
Orlando Sequera: all right. I'm going to post the chat right now.

1233
02:19:52.530 --> 02:19:55.510
Orlando Sequera: Chat has been passed. I see your answers.

1234
02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:56.560
Orlando Sequera: and

1235
02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:00.819
Orlando Sequera: these are

1236
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:03.429
Orlando Sequera: the actual right answer is a, and the

1237
02:20:03.570 --> 02:20:10.669
Orlando Sequera: and Fan is the project manager, and then working with the team. So you as the Pm. You have to work with the team.

1238
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:11.390
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1239
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:17.029
Orlando Sequera: A the next one, and then was to give the executive team an overview

1240
02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:36.230
Orlando Sequera: of the work ahead in the next strategy meeting, which artifacts should he show them? They want to give an overview of the work ahead of the next strategy meeting, which artifacts, should he show them? Should it be the per, the scope management plan, the pro roadmap scope statement, or the Wbs. They want to give it

1241
02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:39.720
Orlando Sequera: the executive team, an overview of the work ahead

1242
02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.720
Orlando Sequera: at the next strategy.

1243
02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:44.910
Orlando Sequera: and here,

1244
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:47.150
Orlando Sequera: big 2.

1245
02:20:47.620 --> 02:20:49.589
Orlando Sequera: The chat is now

1246
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:53.050
Orlando Sequera: open.

1247
02:20:53.650 --> 02:20:54.880
Orlando Sequera: It's on past

1248
02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:56.440
Orlando Sequera: to pick 2.

1249
02:21:01.770 --> 02:21:04.319
Orlando Sequera: Okay, i'm looking at your answers

1250
02:21:04.390 --> 02:21:07.699
Orlando Sequera: and the correct answer that we have here is

1251
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:08.989
Orlando Sequera: the chat. Now

1252
02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:12.579
Orlando Sequera: the correct answer is.

1253
02:21:14.430 --> 02:21:18.239
Orlando Sequera: they want to show their roadmap, and they also want to show this of statement.

1254
02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:19.090
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1255
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:21.790
Orlando Sequera: and this is what we have cover

1256
02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:23.679
Orlando Sequera: so far.

1257
02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.350
Orlando Sequera: We went over

1258
02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:28.710
Orlando Sequera: executing the project with the urgency needed

1259
02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:31.240
Orlando Sequera: to deliver business value.

1260
02:21:31.350 --> 02:21:37.969
Orlando Sequera: We started talking about plan and managing scope, following a predictive approach, and following an adaptive approach.

1261
02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:50.810
Orlando Sequera: we talked about prioritizing requirements, regardless of the approach, and then the breakdown of this scope. If we're following a predictive approach. We do the breakdown of the scope, using the word breakdown structure.

1262
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:56.110
Orlando Sequera: That's how we can break down the entire scope of the project into smaller chunks.

1263
02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:06.520
Orlando Sequera: Or if we're following a pretty, an adaptive approach or agile approach, we represent the scope using a product backlog that contains

1264
02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:14.850
Orlando Sequera: the requirements that we have to deliver. But we call those requirements user stories. So me and and remember also what we said

1265
02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:19.720
Orlando Sequera: in predictive, we have a plethora of of requirements.

1266
02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:27.970
Orlando Sequera: It's not just basis requirements. We've got functional requirements. We have transition requirements. We have technical requirements, multiple types of requirements, right

1267
02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:30.189
Orlando Sequera: agile. We only have

1268
02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:45.739
Orlando Sequera: one type of requirement, which is the perspective of the customer. I only care about the perspective of the customer, and a user story is a sure description that is told. A short description of what of the functionality that

1269
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:49.499
Orlando Sequera: the customer wants to see in the product service of result

1270
02:22:49.530 --> 02:22:54.380
Orlando Sequera: to from their perspective, and he has 3 elements that we mentioned yesterday.

1271
02:22:54.410 --> 02:22:57.179
Orlando Sequera: First element is the role or the user

1272
02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:01.429
Orlando Sequera: as a user as an administrator, as a

1273
02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.809
Orlando Sequera: etc. Then the actual functionality

1274
02:23:05.350 --> 02:23:07.050
Orlando Sequera: I want to be able to

1275
02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:15.159
Orlando Sequera: generate a monthly sales report, and the last element is the benefit. So those are the 3 elements that a good user story has.

1276
02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:18.640
Orlando Sequera: and we also talked about

1277
02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:25.990
Orlando Sequera: Well, we cover some aspects of managing a project closure and transitions.

1278
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:29.650
Orlando Sequera: Now we're going to start talking about

1279
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:43.209
Orlando Sequera: the schedule. So we need to have this scope in place. Really. Well, regardless of the approach, we need to have a really good handle of the scope. Everything starts with the scope. If you don't have

1280
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:45.760
Orlando Sequera: a good understanding of the scope.

1281
02:23:46.430 --> 02:23:50.290
Orlando Sequera: you're going to be in trouble, because everything else that you build

1282
02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:56.049
Orlando Sequera: is going to be around the scope, and the scope itself has its foundation. Which is

1283
02:23:56.170 --> 02:23:57.170
Orlando Sequera: your

1284
02:23:57.830 --> 02:24:10.640
Orlando Sequera: your requirements. Okay, the foundation of the scope is the requirements we have to. That's why we have multiple techniques to gather them, and you gotta have a solid handle of the scope. Otherwise your project is going to be

1285
02:24:10.650 --> 02:24:18.110
Orlando Sequera: in in trouble from the get go. Okay, because everything else is built around the scope scope is king. Scope is king.

1286
02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.250
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to the schedule

1287
02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.880
Orlando Sequera: to get from a to B.

1288
02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:27.850
Orlando Sequera: If If we're following a predictive approach.

1289
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:32.549
Orlando Sequera: the project manager has to make sure as to make sure that

1290
02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:46.990
Orlando Sequera: your war package that your work break, and structure is in place. Let's start with that, and that you have been able to decompose the entire scope of the project, and you have your word packages in place.

1291
02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:53.429
Orlando Sequera: You know that the window, the floor, the roof, the tile

1292
02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:55.460
Orlando Sequera: the doors.

1293
02:24:55.540 --> 02:25:09.449
Orlando Sequera: all those different word packages for your house are have been identified; and not only that, that you have been able to decompose those word packages into the actions, into the activities that you have to complete, to deliver those 4 packages.

1294
02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:17.339
Orlando Sequera: For example, window. What do we have under that word package? We have to measure the window. We have to

1295
02:25:17.350 --> 02:25:37.180
Orlando Sequera: fabricate the window or purchase the window. We have to install the window. We have to test the window, and when all of those activities are completed that's when we can deliver the window, and when that window is completed all those activities are completed. That's when a deliberable has been produced, that window installed, tested, and approved.

1296
02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:38.489
Orlando Sequera: That's a deliverable.

1297
02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:50.279
Orlando Sequera: And as we complete those deliverables, that's how we complete our project. Okay, that's why this is so important. We need to have all those word packages divided into the required activities.

1298
02:25:50.380 --> 02:26:07.219
Orlando Sequera: We need to start then grouping those activities to understand what needs to happen first, when is to happen later. That's what we call dependencies. We need to understand dependencies, because otherwise you're going to be like me. You don't want to be like me. You're going to start building the house, probably starting with a roof.

1299
02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:22.580
Orlando Sequera: and maybe that's possible. Maybe not. But I would think that we want to start with the building. The foundation of the house, and then build everything everything else after that, right? So we need to understand what needs to happen, for first we need to happens later.

1300
02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.250
Orlando Sequera: And then we need to start understanding the duration

1301
02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:28.100
Orlando Sequera: of those activities

1302
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:46.179
Orlando Sequera: and also the resources of those activities, and eventually the cost associated with those activities. We need to understand also something that is called the critical path. We're going to talk about that. That is a we need to identify. What are those activities that cannot be delayed in our project.

1303
02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:56.009
Orlando Sequera: We also need to look at the resources. So we are smart and efficient in the way we're allocating resources, and

1304
02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:02.140
Orlando Sequera: we also need to make sure that our schedule, if in the event of

1305
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:04.650
Orlando Sequera: compressed, is compressed to meet any.

1306
02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:13.339
Orlando Sequera: So that's how it works in a predictive approach. In another approach we can use. We're going to use a time box.

1307
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:14.539
Orlando Sequera: cadence.

1308
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:16.420
Orlando Sequera: sprint or iterations.

1309
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:21.070
Orlando Sequera: We're going to use a release timeframe. We're going to be releasing

1310
02:27:21.130 --> 02:27:31.179
Orlando Sequera: chunks of functionality, multiple iterations combined. At the same time, we're going to release that we're going to plan our work in one iteration at a time.

1311
02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:47.689
Orlando Sequera: We're going to prioritize and determine a dig and estimate and decompose the level of effort associated with the user stories, with the requirements, and that's going to be breaking down into tasks, and that's what's going to determine the iteration velocity.

1312
02:27:47.720 --> 02:28:01.969
Orlando Sequera: Talk about that later. But that is up to the team the team itself as a self-organized unit. They are the ones that estimate the effort. They are the ones that break down the user stories or requirements into tasks.

1313
02:28:02.130 --> 02:28:13.710
Orlando Sequera: and then they, we work with the product owner to refine the backlog after each iteration, and then we start planning the next one because it's we do it multiple times. That's what we call it iterations, right?

1314
02:28:14.370 --> 02:28:16.000
Orlando Sequera: We also have

1315
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:17.680
Orlando Sequera: our

1316
02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:21.020
Orlando Sequera: schedule management plan.

1317
02:28:21.310 --> 02:28:27.800
Orlando Sequera: This is going to change, depending on the approach whether we're going agile or whether we go in predictive.

1318
02:28:27.850 --> 02:28:29.899
Orlando Sequera: And it's going to

1319
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:35.150
Orlando Sequera: describe how these activities are going to be defined

1320
02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:42.600
Orlando Sequera: and progressively elaborated because they can change us More information becomes available. Everything is subject to change here.

1321
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:48.210
Orlando Sequera: It's going to help us to identify what is the scheduling method and the scheduling tool that we're gonna use

1322
02:28:48.730 --> 02:28:50.570
Orlando Sequera: the schedule format.

1323
02:28:50.730 --> 02:29:07.439
Orlando Sequera: the criteria that is going to help us to control the schedule. These can be tailored in any type of project that rules of engagement that we're going to follow for the schedule. That's what we have in the schedule management plan, and also how we're going to maintain this schedule.

1324
02:29:08.730 --> 02:29:10.680
Orlando Sequera: We also have

1325
02:29:15.550 --> 02:29:17.150
Orlando Sequera: a hour

1326
02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:22.410
Orlando Sequera: components. What are the components of the schedule management plan?

1327
02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:26.079
Orlando Sequera: The methodology that we're going to use to develop our schedule

1328
02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:46.140
Orlando Sequera: and how we go. That includes planning status updates and progress through an execution. The rules that we're going to follow for that. How accurate is going to be when it comes to estimation. If so, we don't have to. So, for example, this goes back to duration. Right a are we?

1329
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:47.870
Orlando Sequera: Are we going to be using.

1330
02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:55.750
Orlando Sequera: And, by the way, the next, the next point units of measure. Are we talking about hours? Are we talking about days?

1331
02:29:55.770 --> 02:29:58.060
Orlando Sequera: And the level of accuracy is

1332
02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:02.450
Orlando Sequera: what is the lowest level of estimation that we're going to use

1333
02:30:02.770 --> 02:30:08.999
Orlando Sequera: typically in most of my projects. I I don't go anything that is below 4 h.

1334
02:30:09.090 --> 02:30:18.049
Orlando Sequera: I that's that's I don't go any lower than 4 h. That's half a day, so I wouldn't. In some cases you might be asked to.

1335
02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:36.179
Orlando Sequera: They increase the level of the to be more specific. But to me that's usually my lowest. I don't go, but that is defining the accuracy. So it might be different in some of in some of your organization. So in the guide, the main guideline is going to be the Pmo.

1336
02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:53.030
Orlando Sequera: what are the organizational procedure links? They? There are going to be links between the activities and the Wbs because they come from the Wbs. So your estimates and schedule, these all these has to be integrated. What are they? Control thresholds when we start

1337
02:30:53.340 --> 02:31:03.079
Orlando Sequera: looking at the performance? How well are we performing, then? When do we have to take action? That's going to be defined by the control threshold, right? And

1338
02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:14.009
Orlando Sequera: what are the rules of performance measurement? When we compare what is happening. We call that actuals against what we plan for. We use earn value management.

1339
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:29.950
Orlando Sequera: And how frequently are we going to report on status that's defined here in the schedule management plan, and then how we going to a document this processes. That's also part of the schedule management plan. Okay, that is.

1340
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:33.239
Orlando Sequera: that is crucial. That is important

1341
02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:34.320
Orlando Sequera: work

1342
02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:42.219
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning. Where do we start? We start working on developing our schedule and build our schedule.

1343
02:31:42.590 --> 02:31:46.859
Orlando Sequera: The same thing that we did with scope, we can compare with previous projects

1344
02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:50.489
Orlando Sequera: and historical information we can compare with the previous project

1345
02:31:50.650 --> 02:31:52.819
Orlando Sequera: we're building a one-story house.

1346
02:31:53.220 --> 02:31:56.220
Orlando Sequera: Maybe in the past we build a one-story house.

1347
02:31:56.560 --> 02:32:13.310
Orlando Sequera: This compared to a previous project. So this took 6 months. It took us 6 months to complete to build a one Story House. So that's using benchmarking, and it's what is just a starting point. It's just a starting point. Okay, you shouldn't go.

1348
02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:19.090
Orlando Sequera: You You should keep that into account. It's just a starting point. And but then you have to

1349
02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:25.300
Orlando Sequera: work. And using these processes to really build a solid schedule for your project

1350
02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:28.390
Orlando Sequera: A.

1351
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:32.099
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to hybrid schedules

1352
02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:38.130
Orlando Sequera: it is important to be able to meet customer change and demands. Organizations need

1353
02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:46.550
Orlando Sequera: a scheduling solutions that can tailor to feed the product, development, or project needs. So this is when you have to tailor your plans

1354
02:32:46.900 --> 02:32:52.790
Orlando Sequera: consistently in with with management oversight to a and flexible scheduling of work.

1355
02:32:53.130 --> 02:33:11.110
Orlando Sequera: and this is better when a better program deliver quality with incremental and short term value, delivery and change are incomparable on intervals. So this is where a hybrid schedule comes into play, or when you can divide your pro delivery into subsets, according to a plan

1356
02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:15.549
Orlando Sequera: following a a milestone or following a cadence

1357
02:33:16.210 --> 02:33:17.890
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1358
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:21.380
Orlando Sequera: predictive schedule planning.

1359
02:33:22.450 --> 02:33:38.380
Orlando Sequera: This is how it gets done. The project manager is going to break down the work packages working with the team into the requirement activities into the required activities. What we need to do in order to deliver that word package

1360
02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:54.369
Orlando Sequera: ideally, we should include the team members, the people doing the work. They're the most familiar with the word that needs to be done. We also have to determine what needs to happen first when it happens later that's what we call dependencies and precedence relationships.

1361
02:33:54.390 --> 02:34:01.500
Orlando Sequera: Some of these activities need to be performed first. Some of these activities need to be performed later. Some of them can be done in parallel.

1362
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:24.759
Orlando Sequera: We need to establish that. Then we to estimate the duration of these activities, how many hours based whatever we Whatever we decide with the schedule management plan, we're gonna let's assume that we're going to use ours. We need to start estimating that duration. And again, the recommendation, even in predictive, is to have is to involve, at the very least to involve the people doing the work

1363
02:34:24.770 --> 02:34:37.839
Orlando Sequera: with the estimation process, then we need to determine. What are those activities out of the entire list of activities that we have? Where are those activities that cannot be delayed? Those activities are

1364
02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:44.590
Orlando Sequera: what we call the critical path, because basically if any of those activities gets delayed.

1365
02:34:44.610 --> 02:34:46.530
Orlando Sequera: your entire

1366
02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:50.920
Orlando Sequera: project is going to be delayed. We need to identify those activities that have

1367
02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:56.379
Orlando Sequera: that that cannot be delayed at all. We're going to talk about that.

1368
02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.890
Orlando Sequera: And again, this is going to help us with

1369
02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:02.280
Orlando Sequera: solving resource over allocation

1370
02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:22.860
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to breaking down the war packages into activities, As I mentioned before, where packages are expressed as nouns window. That's a word package door. That's a word package roof. That's a that's a word package. That's how we

1371
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:24.790
Orlando Sequera: We used nouns

1372
02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:28.950
Orlando Sequera: to express more packages. Activities

1373
02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:34.180
Orlando Sequera: are verbs. They denote action

1374
02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:42.639
Orlando Sequera: what we have under a word package. Let's assume that we're talking about the word Package a window, then the activity is going to be.

1375
02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.100
Orlando Sequera: Measure the window. That's a verb right measure.

1376
02:35:47.250 --> 02:35:49.680
Orlando Sequera: Then install the window.

1377
02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:50.630
Orlando Sequera: test

1378
02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:51.869
Orlando Sequera: the window.

1379
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:57.239
Orlando Sequera: deliver the window. All those are verbs. They denote action

1380
02:35:57.450 --> 02:36:05.599
Orlando Sequera: that those are the activities. Okay. So war packages, nouns, activities are verbs. We need to be able to create

1381
02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:07.710
Orlando Sequera: an activity list

1382
02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:15.909
Orlando Sequera: to develop the project schedule and where does it come from it comes from the Wbs. If you don't have your Ws in place.

1383
02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:29.919
Orlando Sequera: then you're gonna be in trouble. Okay, you're gonna be in trouble. That's why we need to spend and take the time to work on our requirements, and then in our scope to get it right. Otherwise we're going to be in trouble.

1384
02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:33.759
Orlando Sequera: then the next step is going to be

1385
02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:40.500
Orlando Sequera: to go over the dependencies. Once we have been able to identify the list of activities.

1386
02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:45.599
Orlando Sequera: we need to start working on dependencies, we need to start grouping them logically.

1387
02:36:45.730 --> 02:36:53.019
Orlando Sequera: In some cases we might have mandatory dependencies. These are contractually required, legally required.

1388
02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:55.040
Orlando Sequera: Their mandatory dependencies.

1389
02:36:55.100 --> 02:37:00.590
Orlando Sequera: In some cases they might be based on best practices. That's what we call discretionary.

1390
02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:02.500
Orlando Sequera: So about best practices.

1391
02:37:02.530 --> 02:37:04.610
Orlando Sequera: Then you might have some external

1392
02:37:04.850 --> 02:37:06.010
Orlando Sequera: dependencies.

1393
02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:21.179
Orlando Sequera: You might have any. You might have no control or limited control, or you might have some internal dependencies. But you need to start the dependencies between all of those activities. Okay, need to understand that. And then the precedence.

1394
02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:27.150
Orlando Sequera: What needs to happen first and what needs to happen later

1395
02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:55.240
Orlando Sequera: need to understand a: we we need to start grouping those activities, so we can start a understanding what activity needs to be complete, the first and more activities to be comp later time. And what can be done in prior in parallel, because otherwise you're going to be like me. You rest are probably building the hospital to start with a roof. Let's work our way down right to start with the roof and then work our way down. Is that going to be the most efficient way? Possibly not. But we need to understand that

1396
02:37:55.250 --> 02:37:58.119
Orlando Sequera: working with our

1397
02:37:58.430 --> 02:38:03.469
Orlando Sequera: experts with your so with our subject matter experts to avoid just that

1398
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:08.000
Orlando Sequera: each activity when it comes to precedence, each activity is going to have

1399
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:13.130
Orlando Sequera: a 2 open points start and finish that we see here

1400
02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:16.790
Orlando Sequera: the present relationships they take into account

1401
02:38:17.210 --> 02:38:34.030
Orlando Sequera: appropriate logic when we're connecting this points right? That's what we use. We connect through the arrows and and then they the the activity that needs to be completed. First. That's what we call the predecessor, the driver, and then the bacteria needs to be completed later.

1402
02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:51.289
Orlando Sequera: That is what we call the successor, and this is a little, a little bit of an example we need to be able to confirm. That's a that's a verb confirmed key, stakeholder and customer attendance, and then the successories erect Same signage with customer branding that happens later.

1403
02:38:51.310 --> 02:38:52.090
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1404
02:38:52.300 --> 02:39:03.660
Orlando Sequera: in most situations and predecessors occur earlier the in time, then, successors and precedence relationships are going to always be assigned

1405
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:10.790
Orlando Sequera: and to activities based on the dependencies of each activity. This is where your experts are going to help. You

1406
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:24.710
Orlando Sequera: are going to help establish this precedence relationship. What needs to happen first? One need to happens later. Some of you can. The stakeholders help, Yes, but mainly the people doing the work. These are the activities that come every

1407
02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:33.699
Orlando Sequera: need to be completed by the team. So the team and the experts there's the one. They're the ones that are mainly working on this precedence relationship.

1408
02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:38.359
Orlando Sequera: And when it comes to precedence relationships we have multiple types.

1409
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:40.280
Orlando Sequera: Not only have one type.

1410
02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:41.460
Orlando Sequera: we have

1411
02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:47.470
Orlando Sequera: multiple types. We have what we call finished to start

1412
02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:49.430
Orlando Sequera: and

1413
02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:52.939
Orlando Sequera: in when it comes to finish. To start. This is where

1414
02:39:53.250 --> 02:40:00.509
Orlando Sequera: we have to complete the predecessor activity. In this case Activity a has to be completed before activity e

1415
02:40:00.570 --> 02:40:01.650
Orlando Sequera: can start.

1416
02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:04.949
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by a

1417
02:40:05.310 --> 02:40:07.469
Orlando Sequera: finish to start. For example.

1418
02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:14.579
Orlando Sequera: obtain the occupancy permit from oasis down building department before the team

1419
02:40:15.390 --> 02:40:19.070
Orlando Sequera: before the team can identify the finished basis

1420
02:40:19.150 --> 02:40:20.469
Orlando Sequera: for the tour.

1421
02:40:20.590 --> 02:40:21.400
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1422
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.710
Orlando Sequera: So the company can only take visitors

1423
02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:28.369
Orlando Sequera: 2 spaces that are certified.

1424
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:32.979
Orlando Sequera: safe for occupancy, so they need to get the permit before they can

1425
02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:37.570
Orlando Sequera: take people to spaces in

1426
02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.220
Orlando Sequera: in that location. All right, then the next type of

1427
02:40:43.650 --> 02:40:46.679
Orlando Sequera: dependent precedence relationship that we have is

1428
02:40:46.810 --> 02:40:48.029
Orlando Sequera: what we called

1429
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:50.449
Orlando Sequera: finished to finish. And here.

1430
02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:56.879
Orlando Sequera: as successor, activity cannot finish until the predecessor has finished. In this case

1431
02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:04.600
Orlando Sequera: our complete landscaping and decoration cannot finish before they identify finished space

1432
02:41:04.650 --> 02:41:08.370
Orlando Sequera: before we finish identifying the spaces for the tour.

1433
02:41:08.390 --> 02:41:09.070
Okay.

1434
02:41:09.730 --> 02:41:11.629
Orlando Sequera: So we have to complete

1435
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:18.690
Orlando Sequera: the landscaping and decoration has to be finished before we're able to identify the finished basis for the tour.

1436
02:41:19.170 --> 02:41:22.759
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by that. That's an example of finish to finish.

1437
02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:28.929
Orlando Sequera: And then we have a another type of presence that is called start to finish.

1438
02:41:29.410 --> 02:41:35.099
Orlando Sequera: And here we mean that a successor activity cannot start

1439
02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:38.059
Orlando Sequera: until a predecessor has started.

1440
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:43.980
Orlando Sequera: So activity D completely. Landscaping and decoration in this case

1441
02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:46.350
Orlando Sequera: cannot be

1442
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:51.149
Orlando Sequera: a cannot start until the processor has started. So

1443
02:41:52.310 --> 02:41:55.549
Orlando Sequera: in this case the actual

1444
02:41:55.970 --> 02:41:57.180
Orlando Sequera: start to finish

1445
02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:02.509
Orlando Sequera: the ground escaping team. They need to start

1446
02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:06.480
Orlando Sequera: landscaping and decorating at any time.

1447
02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:15.010
Orlando Sequera: But until the science and erected, then the whole side is complete. They cannot finish their work. So that's what we mean by start to finish.

1448
02:42:15.370 --> 02:42:28.519
Orlando Sequera: By the way, you might be wondering. This is a lot of dependencies. We have one more. We have actually 2 more, this is a lot of presence. How do we do this in our project.

1449
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:39.610
Orlando Sequera: How can we practice? This is a lot of information to keep this Manually we use software for this. This is something that you can determine and use in

1450
02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:48.400
Orlando Sequera: Microsoft Project, for example, or Primavera. Those are the 2 tools that i'm the most familiar with you can select. You can

1451
02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.630
Orlando Sequera: not select.

1452
02:42:49.690 --> 02:42:55.349
Orlando Sequera: incorporate this precedence relationship. The next one finished to start.

1453
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:59.319
Orlando Sequera: That's another one and finish to start, we have

1454
02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:07.720
Orlando Sequera: a basically an activity and not a in finished to start an activity cannot finish until

1455
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:09.539
Orlando Sequera: activity. The processor

1456
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:14.679
Orlando Sequera: have to finish before you can start working on your a successor.

1457
02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:23.079
Orlando Sequera: and then we have start to start, which i'm gonna make a confession here. I have never used that in one of my in one of my

1458
02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:39.789
Orlando Sequera: project schedules Never use that because it's basically that both have to start. it's. One example is typically that you're in this case confirm the key stakeholder and customer Attendance has to start before

1459
02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:43.960
Orlando Sequera: erect segment with customer branding can start.

1460
02:43:44.370 --> 02:43:45.830
Orlando Sequera: This is

1461
02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:48.719
Orlando Sequera: something that I have never used before in my

1462
02:43:48.820 --> 02:44:02.750
Orlando Sequera: for your schedules. It is an option. You're gonna see it in Microsoft Project it. But think of another good example. I would say. That will make it clear is a Imagine the night shift of

1463
02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:05.600
Orlando Sequera: nurses at a hospital.

1464
02:44:05.770 --> 02:44:06.680
Orlando Sequera: they

1465
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:09.839
Orlando Sequera: they not they! They first shift.

1466
02:44:16.130 --> 02:44:28.799
Orlando Sequera: cannot leave until the second shift. This has to be a nurse covering that shift, so that will be an example of start to start all right. So this precedence relationships are going to help us to add some

1467
02:44:31.890 --> 02:44:47.889
Orlando Sequera: to add some logic to our schedule. We need to understand what needs to happen first. What needs to happen in later. In one thing that is also going to help us to add even more realism to your precedence.

1468
02:44:48.470 --> 02:44:52.639
Orlando Sequera: relationships to this logic is, we can add lags.

1469
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:55.789
Orlando Sequera: and we can also add.

1470
02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:59.309
Orlando Sequera: leads. Some activities can start

1471
02:44:59.790 --> 02:45:05.109
Orlando Sequera: before that will be a lead time before we can start sometime before

1472
02:45:05.490 --> 02:45:11.349
Orlando Sequera: A, not everything has to be done sequential, right? As we saw. We have multiple types of press and relationships.

1473
02:45:11.390 --> 02:45:13.560
Orlando Sequera: and we can also add a lack.

1474
02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:15.260
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so

1475
02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:23.280
Orlando Sequera: this a particular example. Here we can. We went to include a a time in which the agency

1476
02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:40.450
Orlando Sequera: issuing the occupancy permit is is very slow, which happens in most cases, so they begin efforts to confirm the receipt of occupancy permit before 2 weeks before the team identifies the finish spaces for the tour. That's an example of a lead. Okay.

1477
02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:51.849
Orlando Sequera: what I like in this example the team starts directing stakeholder specific signage for the tour. 2 weeks after the key stakeholder and customer attendance is confirmed

1478
02:45:51.990 --> 02:46:05.369
Orlando Sequera: that because creating a specialty signage is, it takes time, and it's expensive. So the thing was to make sure the designers have enough time to create something that is going to please the customers, For

1479
02:46:05.390 --> 02:46:06.910
Orlando Sequera: this new building.

1480
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:08.960
Orlando Sequera: So we use leads.

1481
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:13.860
Orlando Sequera: We use flags to add more realism to your schedule. All right.

1482
02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:17.549
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So

1483
02:46:18.030 --> 02:46:19.110
Orlando Sequera: we have.

1484
02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:24.520
Orlando Sequera: We have covered the content for our first

1485
02:46:25.570 --> 02:46:32.389
Orlando Sequera: for first session. But now i'm going to work on addressing some questions until

1486
02:46:32.730 --> 02:46:33.730
Orlando Sequera: we have

1487
02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:37.720
Orlando Sequera: 14 min, and I'm going to address

1488
02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:46.240
Orlando Sequera: your questions. Please vote, please review the questions and vote, and that's going to help me to start addressing with the ones

1489
02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:51.330
Orlando Sequera: A. With the questions. I need to have them more vote. I want to start by that.

1490
02:46:51.580 --> 02:46:55.790
Orlando Sequera: The first one can a project manager make corrections or change

1491
02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:03.900
Orlando Sequera: business.

1492
02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:05.959
Orlando Sequera: I'm: sorry.

1493
02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:22.119
Orlando Sequera: Okay, there's one ticket. I'm gonna start with a different one that has more votes for scheduled planning specifically critical path activities. How did you handle delays that are outside of your control, and we're unpredictable.

1494
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:27.499
Orlando Sequera: When answer is.

1495
02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:34.809
Orlando Sequera: for example, massive supply chain delays due to the pandemic. That is an enterprise environmental factor.

1496
02:47:35.130 --> 02:47:38.180
Orlando Sequera: And one way is we're gonna

1497
02:47:38.370 --> 02:47:39.980
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be covering

1498
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.109
Orlando Sequera: from the schedule perspective. We have 2 tools that can help you with that

1499
02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:47.789
Orlando Sequera: A.

1500
02:47:47.860 --> 02:47:52.729
Orlando Sequera: From the scheduled perspective. You can use scheduled compression.

1501
02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.140
Orlando Sequera: or you can

1502
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:58.670
Orlando Sequera: follow another technique that is going to help you

1503
02:47:58.780 --> 02:48:17.759
Orlando Sequera: to do some activities that normally you will do is sequentially. Now you're gonna do it in parallel. So there are tools and techniques that can help you to address those challenges. We're gonna go over that. when we come back from break. Okay, so yes, there are tools.

1504
02:48:17.770 --> 02:48:24.869
Orlando Sequera: And by the way, the exam is about that, what do we do if we're facing, that might very well be an example.

1505
02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:38.629
Orlando Sequera: So, is somewhat somehow of a type of a question. What did you do if you're experiencing a delay. What? What? What do you have to do? So it's using these tools and techniques. We're going to call schedule compression.

1506
02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:41.969
Orlando Sequera: And doing things in parallel

1507
02:48:42.210 --> 02:48:54.699
Orlando Sequera: some materials in parallel. That's one way that you can do fast tracking. That is called schedule compression and fast tracking. Those are 2 techniques that you can use to handle those delays. We're going to talk about that when we come back from Brick. So

1508
02:48:55.610 --> 02:49:04.060
Orlando Sequera: schedule confession of fast tracking. Another question. Can a project manager make corrections or change to to a business requirement

1509
02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:23.469
Orlando Sequera: in in case of an unprecedented, a major change in a milestone. The answer is, Yes, but be careful with this, do you? When you're If you're changing a requirement, make sure that you get buying from the appropriate parties, and by that I mean whomever was designed with that, whoever whomever has

1510
02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:40.469
Orlando Sequera: the level of a 30, you shouldn't be changing requirements on your on the fly, on your own, even if you're the Pm. Do you get a get authorization for that? Okay. And normally you're not going to have enough of a 30 to do it on your own. So I will recommend you to review with the authorized parties.

1511
02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:51.739
Orlando Sequera: with the sponsor, and in your stakeholders that need to sign off before a change is a made, and in this case this might the if you're following a predictive approach.

1512
02:49:51.850 --> 02:49:57.900
Orlando Sequera: this will be a case in which you will have to create a change, request and go through the change. Control process

1513
02:50:01.870 --> 02:50:09.809
Orlando Sequera: is an adaptive story. Map, equivalent to a predictive word. Break the structure. No, the equivalent to the war break. The structure is the

1514
02:50:09.850 --> 02:50:15.119
Orlando Sequera: broader backlog. The product backlog is the equivalent to the word breakdown structure.

1515
02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:26.340
Orlando Sequera: I can do.

1516
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:39.819
Orlando Sequera: Can you lay out the full list of requirements based off of predictive Adj. On hybrid you should. That's part of your job. You have to work with the team, and they find in the full list of requirements.

1517
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:46.540
Orlando Sequera: You need to understand the requirements that you can then understand the scope. So sure. Answer is yes.

1518
02:50:50.530 --> 02:50:51.890
Orlando Sequera: Please explain

1519
02:50:52.170 --> 02:50:54.850
Orlando Sequera: Once again resonance relationships.

1520
02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.569
Orlando Sequera: You need to

1521
02:50:58.030 --> 02:51:16.599
Orlando Sequera: understand the logical sequence of those activities. Some of them can need to be them first, some of them to be done later. You need to. That's how you build the schedule. Okay, what needs to happen first? Want it to happen later, and some things can be done in parallel. Something. Then you can add, leads, and lack

1522
02:51:16.610 --> 02:51:27.349
Orlando Sequera: lax to make it better. Some things can be done ahead of time. Some things need to wait a little bit longer. So that's where you use leads and lacks. So it's connecting those activities.

1523
02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:28.380
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1524
02:51:31.730 --> 02:51:33.550
Orlando Sequera: it's about connecting

1525
02:51:34.610 --> 02:51:36.460
Orlando Sequera: those activities.

1526
02:51:38.770 --> 02:51:40.940
Orlando Sequera: And that was answered.

1527
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:46.590
Orlando Sequera: is an adaptive approach really suitable for highly regular industries.

1528
02:51:46.650 --> 02:51:48.839
Orlando Sequera: In some cases, Yes.

1529
02:51:49.850 --> 02:51:56.950
Orlando Sequera: aerospace is highly regulated, and is that the adaptive approach agile is widely used for development purposes. So

1530
02:51:57.010 --> 02:51:57.920
Orlando Sequera: yes.

1531
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:10.760
Orlando Sequera: that's a transition plan need to be created at the beginning towards the end, you should.

1532
02:52:10.930 --> 02:52:12.949
Orlando Sequera: Your plans are created at the beginning.

1533
02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:14.980
Orlando Sequera: They are created at the beginning.

1534
02:52:15.210 --> 02:52:29.639
Orlando Sequera: So best practices to create at the beginning. Take that into account and have it ready. Not you. Don't want to build a plane when you're flying the plane or let alone when you're about. In this case, when you're about to land the plane, you don't you. You want to have it in place at the beginning.

1535
02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:32.610
Orlando Sequera: The

1536
02:52:42.270 --> 02:52:43.610
Okay?

1537
02:52:54.140 --> 02:53:00.449
Orlando Sequera: Okay. there's a question To go back to slide 49. Let's go back to slide 49.

1538
02:53:19.620 --> 02:53:20.400
Okay?

1539
02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:21.440
Orlando Sequera: So

1540
02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:24.549
Orlando Sequera: the 2 questions that we were covering

1541
02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:25.440
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1542
02:53:31.130 --> 02:53:33.669
Orlando Sequera: The quote, the 2 questions that we were covering

1543
02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:36.680
Orlando Sequera: a a couple of things here. You might.

1544
02:53:36.730 --> 02:53:39.159
Orlando Sequera: but first of all, do my get

1545
02:53:39.390 --> 02:53:42.090
Orlando Sequera: this type of question when it comes to

1546
02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:44.699
Orlando Sequera: choosing more than one right answer.

1547
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:47.569
Orlando Sequera: Please pay attention to what they ask you for

1548
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:49.669
Orlando Sequera: choose to choose 3,

1549
02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:51.439
Orlando Sequera: pick 2, pick, 3,

1550
02:53:51.530 --> 02:54:02.279
Orlando Sequera: they might say like that. So if they asking you to pick to make sure that you select 2 options. If they're asking you to select 3, make sure that you select a 3 options.

1551
02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:04.049
Orlando Sequera: Alright, so that's

1552
02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:05.210
Orlando Sequera: one thing

1553
02:54:05.430 --> 02:54:09.990
Orlando Sequera: which 2 stakeholders perform. The project scope, planning.

1554
02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:13.700
Orlando Sequera: That is the question. And they're asking you to select, too.

1555
02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:16.149
Orlando Sequera: And the options were

1556
02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:20.300
Orlando Sequera: your the project manager, then the product owner.

1557
02:54:21.330 --> 02:54:24.389
Orlando Sequera: the project sponsor, and the project team.

1558
02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:26.000
Orlando Sequera: So

1559
02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:34.989
Orlando Sequera: the answer. The answers are a and D. As we see here in the slide. So let's go. I think many of the questions are related to the quiz.

1560
02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:42.270
Orlando Sequera: hey? Helen Gray is the product owner.

1561
02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:44.110
Orlando Sequera: and

1562
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:50.739
Orlando Sequera: she's in charge, or or he she's in charge of the product scope, planning right

1563
02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:54.970
Orlando Sequera: in the adaptive part of the project. The project team members

1564
02:54:55.330 --> 02:55:01.990
Orlando Sequera: are the the local domain experts in planning the scope of the work for each iteration.

1565
02:55:02.130 --> 02:55:09.479
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so this is about Project scope, planning, planning, planning, planning. Right? So

1566
02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:12.419
Orlando Sequera: it is the project manager

1567
02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:16.400
Orlando Sequera: and the project team. Remember that even in

1568
02:55:17.950 --> 02:55:19.170
Orlando Sequera: adaptive

1569
02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:21.499
Orlando Sequera: I'm sorry even in

1570
02:55:21.850 --> 02:55:36.499
Orlando Sequera: a in in predictive the project manager has to work with the project team, but when it comes to the work that is gonna be done planning those iterations, deciding what work is going to be done in those iterations, as we have said

1571
02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:46.090
Orlando Sequera: in. If we're following an agile approach that is strictly to the team that said that the team is self-organized. They make that decision, so they need to be

1572
02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:47.949
Orlando Sequera: They are the ones that perform

1573
02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:52.540
Orlando Sequera: the projects called planning is the project manager and the project team.

1574
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:54.350
Orlando Sequera: and the second question

1575
02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:57.730
Orlando Sequera: the project manager and Fame

1576
02:55:57.810 --> 02:56:03.580
Orlando Sequera: wants to give the executive team an overview of the work ahead of the next strategy meeting.

1577
02:56:03.610 --> 02:56:14.529
Orlando Sequera: which artifacts only there was a type of there should have been artifacts that was confusing. So i'm going to give you that a which artifacts should he show them?

1578
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:19.949
Orlando Sequera: So? He wants to give them an overview of what's going to happen, then

1579
02:56:20.590 --> 02:56:33.560
Orlando Sequera: those artifacts? Why is not this scope management plan? Because the scope management plan those are the rules that we're going to follow to manage this code. That's not going to allow them to understand what an overview of the work.

1580
02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:34.650
Orlando Sequera: Then

1581
02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:49.830
Orlando Sequera: the war breakdown structure is a representation of the scope of the project. The entire scope of the project that's not gonna gonna not gonna give them an overview of the work ahead of the next strategy meeting. So the the per roadmap. Yes, that is

1582
02:56:50.260 --> 02:56:52.199
Orlando Sequera: the representation of the work.

1583
02:56:52.700 --> 02:57:04.700
Orlando Sequera: how it's gonna be done, how we group functionality, and that's the roadmap that is going to allow them to understand and give them an overview of the work ahead, and also this of statement. So

1584
02:57:05.390 --> 02:57:22.249
Orlando Sequera: my recommendation is to, and I see, I think I saw a question about. Well, we're not ready for this type of questions. We're just going through the preparation process. Okay, so we're starting for some of you. This is the first time that you're exposed to this

1585
02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:25.890
Orlando Sequera: to this concept, to these techniques. And it really

1586
02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:39.959
Orlando Sequera: a it's gonna take some time. So you're not ready for the exam yet, so please be patient. Let's go through the content and practice practice practice for a position, and you are going to be ready for the exam.

1587
02:57:40.290 --> 02:57:41.070
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1588
02:57:43.260 --> 02:57:46.210
Orlando Sequera: I think we have time, for

1589
02:57:46.730 --> 02:57:48.650
Orlando Sequera: I would be more questions.

1590
02:57:54.850 --> 02:57:57.129
Orlando Sequera: We explain why

1591
02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:21.400
Orlando Sequera: they're not specifying the approach. They're not. There's a question in the so in queue in quiz. Q one. If it's a pick one, then it will be the project team, and they will mean a laptive approach. Yes, they need. Read the questions carefully. Thank you for that. Read the questions carefully. Pay attention to to what they're asking you.

1592
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:26.040
Orlando Sequera: telling you specifically here which 2 stakeholders perform the scope, planning

1593
02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:31.890
Orlando Sequera: All right, a little bit more questions.

1594
02:58:49.350 --> 02:58:55.529
Orlando Sequera: All of this content is part of the exam. Okay. Otherwise we wouldn't be delivering this content. So

1595
02:58:55.870 --> 02:59:01.880
Orlando Sequera: all the content that we're covering is part of the Pmp. Exam. It comes straight from Pmi.

1596
02:59:05.730 --> 02:59:15.909
Orlando Sequera: Can the Wbs creation in predicted projects be compared with structuring. epic feature user stories. Yeah. We structure epic features of stories

1597
02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:20.880
Orlando Sequera: using the Proto backlog. So yes, the answer is yes to that question.

1598
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:24.780
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1599
02:59:37.690 --> 02:59:42.720
Orlando Sequera: So leading back time is basically that turn over time. You don't get paid for

1600
02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:47.710
Orlando Sequera: You're trying to be as efficient as possible.

1601
02:59:49.960 --> 02:59:53.309
Orlando Sequera: you can start some things before, so you take so

1602
02:59:54.630 --> 03:00:02.419
Orlando Sequera: not everything has to be completed before you start the next activity. That's how you have to look at it. So, in a way to the question

1603
03:00:02.900 --> 03:00:05.239
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. And a. Yes.

1604
03:00:05.710 --> 03:00:08.390
Orlando Sequera: but it's about being smarter about

1605
03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:10.440
Orlando Sequera: completing your activities.

1606
03:00:21.900 --> 03:00:33.740
Orlando Sequera: Another question in the Q. A. You said that user stories only have one requirement. No, I said, that user stories are the way for us to describe. That's how we write requirements in agile

1607
03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:36.210
Orlando Sequera: requirements

1608
03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:38.940
Orlando Sequera: based on the perspective of the customer

1609
03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:56.720
Orlando Sequera: for a job where and how our technical requirements associated with that user story, track and implemented the team is that that's up to the team. The team is gonna work on that. They only need to know the perspective of the customer. But all those technical

1610
03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:03.140
Orlando Sequera: decisions are going to be made by the team. The team is going to address that. They only need

1611
03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:11.109
Orlando Sequera: the description of the requirement from the customer perspective that gets addressed. But the team is going to do that. That's why you have acts

1612
03:01:11.310 --> 03:01:14.540
Orlando Sequera: access to experts. Okay, they are the ones

1613
03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:16.230
Orlando Sequera: that we, the side

1614
03:01:16.380 --> 03:01:17.690
Orlando Sequera: a

1615
03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:21.349
Orlando Sequera: that are going to make those decisions.

1616
03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:27.690
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

1617
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.959
Let me see.

1618
03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:30.690
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1619
03:01:37.050 --> 03:01:39.659
Orlando Sequera: Can we please review, slide 36

1620
03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:42.560
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna go back to 36,

1621
03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:57.119
Orlando Sequera: and we are going. We are ready for our break. So take this question, and then we're going to take an hour. Break

1622
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.930
Orlando Sequera: more

1623
03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:14.449
Orlando Sequera: alternative analysis. They're going to help us to you. Consider potential options. You you're considering multiple options, and that's take a look at those alternatives and which one is going to be your best option.

1624
03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:39.449
Orlando Sequera: All right, so we are ready for our break. We're going to be answering some questions during the break.

1625
03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:42.320
Orlando Sequera: We'll come back and continue

1626
03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:45.110
Orlando Sequera: a

1627
03:02:47.490 --> 03:02:50.680
Orlando Sequera: in an hour, please do not log off.

1628
03:02:51.700 --> 03:02:52.840
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be

1629
03:02:52.900 --> 03:02:55.119
Orlando Sequera: answering some questions during break time.

1630
03:02:55.160 --> 03:03:05.950
Orlando Sequera: But please do not log off and stay locked in during the break. We're going to be playing important videos that are that are gonna help you to

1631
03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:12.420
Orlando Sequera: a understand some important information. So please stay locked in. Do not log off, Enjoy

1632
03:03:12.570 --> 03:03:17.050
Orlando Sequera: your 1 h break, and we are going to be back

1633
03:03:18.670 --> 03:03:22.519
Orlando Sequera: in a few minutes. We'll be back in an hour, so

1634
03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:26.519
Orlando Sequera: thank you very much, everyone my apologies. We went over a couple of minutes.

1635
03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:27.550
Orlando Sequera: so

1636
03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:31.820
Orlando Sequera: I enjoy your hour. Break.

1637
03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:58.929
Orlando Sequera: Welcome back, everyone. I was going over some of the questions during the break. Hopefully you

1638
03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:00.670
Orlando Sequera: enjoyed your

1639
03:04:01.700 --> 03:04:05.460
Orlando Sequera: your 1 h break, and we're watching Bart's videos.

1640
03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:06.940
Orlando Sequera: and

1641
03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:08.190
Orlando Sequera: I have.

1642
03:04:09.030 --> 03:04:10.619
Orlando Sequera: I would like to address

1643
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:14.699
Orlando Sequera: a couple of topics to make sure that we understand, because it is important

1644
03:04:15.050 --> 03:04:16.589
Orlando Sequera: for the exam.

1645
03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:21.489
Orlando Sequera: The first one is

1646
03:04:21.850 --> 03:04:23.869
Orlando Sequera: related to

1647
03:04:24.940 --> 03:04:31.260
Orlando Sequera: the precedence relationships. Okay, so let me move over to this slide.

1648
03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:32.979
Orlando Sequera: I would like to

1649
03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:34.930
Orlando Sequera: explain

1650
03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.550
Orlando Sequera: one more time and a little bit better.

1651
03:04:37.610 --> 03:04:44.190
Orlando Sequera: The different type of precedence of relationships that we have. The first one is

1652
03:04:44.210 --> 03:04:45.870
Orlando Sequera: finish to start.

1653
03:04:46.060 --> 03:04:50.470
Orlando Sequera: And basically what we're saying here we're finished. To start is that

1654
03:04:50.690 --> 03:04:52.750
Orlando Sequera: an activity has to finish

1655
03:04:52.880 --> 03:04:54.390
Orlando Sequera: the the

1656
03:04:55.040 --> 03:05:08.249
Orlando Sequera: if we need to start the success. The successor in which, in this graphic that we see here is activity, cannot start before the predecessor in this example is a today

1657
03:05:08.280 --> 03:05:19.010
Orlando Sequera: and test finish. Okay, that's what we mean to finish. To start. By the way, this is one of the most commonly used type of precedence relationships in your

1658
03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:20.770
Orlando Sequera: A.

1659
03:05:20.980 --> 03:05:36.280
Orlando Sequera: When you're building your schedule using a tool like Microsoft Project. I want to give you an example. Besides what we have here, an example that probably can make can help a little bit better installing the operating system on a computer on a laptop.

1660
03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:40.489
Orlando Sequera: That is, the successor cannot start until

1661
03:05:40.520 --> 03:05:47.700
Orlando Sequera: the hardware has been put together in the laptop. Right? So the hardware has to be has to be put together in the laptop

1662
03:05:47.860 --> 03:05:57.970
Orlando Sequera: before we can start installing the operating system, whatever it is. So that's what we mean by finish to start. Then the next one is

1663
03:05:58.090 --> 03:06:00.170
Orlando Sequera: that we're going to cover is finished to finish.

1664
03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:09.530
Orlando Sequera: This is where the successor cannot finish. In this case the successor's activity. He cannot finish until the predecessor has finished

1665
03:06:09.940 --> 03:06:11.739
Orlando Sequera: an example is.

1666
03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:31.820
Orlando Sequera: besides, what we see in front of us is a writing a document that is, the predecessor is required to finish before we can finish editing the document right? So we have to finish writing a document before we can finish editing the document.

1667
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:34.629
Orlando Sequera: and then we have start to start.

1668
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:42.589
Orlando Sequera: This is where, as successor in this graphic that we see here start to start a successor is activity. F

1669
03:06:43.420 --> 03:06:50.600
Orlando Sequera: cannot start until the predecessor activity. In this case activity c. Has started.

1670
03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:53.170
Orlando Sequera: Okay,

1671
03:06:53.230 --> 03:06:55.639
Orlando Sequera: for example, from construction

1672
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:57.590
Orlando Sequera: leveling concrete.

1673
03:06:57.750 --> 03:07:02.099
Orlando Sequera: That is, the successor. Activity cannot start until we have

1674
03:07:02.330 --> 03:07:03.210
Orlando Sequera: started

1675
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:12.449
Orlando Sequera: or in the foundation. That is their predecessor. Okay, that's an example, and the last one is start to finish.

1676
03:07:13.130 --> 03:07:21.449
Orlando Sequera: This is where a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity finish. has started

1677
03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:27.269
Orlando Sequera: as successor. Activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has started.

1678
03:07:27.910 --> 03:07:29.989
Orlando Sequera: The the example is

1679
03:07:30.210 --> 03:07:32.890
Orlando Sequera: an accounts payable system. Cannot

1680
03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:39.800
Orlando Sequera: that is the so sensor has to start before the old accounts payable system can be shut down.

1681
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:49.760
Orlando Sequera: That is, the predecessor, or another example was the one that I was using before it with at a hospital with nurses. The shift

1682
03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:56.160
Orlando Sequera: then the second shift of nurses had they have to arrive

1683
03:07:56.240 --> 03:07:57.460
Orlando Sequera: before

1684
03:07:57.740 --> 03:08:16.749
Orlando Sequera: the first shift. Nurses can leave right so they can complete the shift. They they always have to be someone there. So that's an example of start to finish. Alright, so hopefully that helps a little bit more. I wanted to add additional clarification, and the second aspect that I would like to

1685
03:08:16.760 --> 03:08:18.050
Orlando Sequera: cover is

1686
03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:22.860
Orlando Sequera: in regards to the quiz. A. Let's go back

1687
03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:30.820
Orlando Sequera: to the quest. If i'm not mistaken, the quiz is a little bit it's before

1688
03:08:32.470 --> 03:08:35.070
Orlando Sequera: I think it's 49

1689
03:08:45.810 --> 03:08:47.569
Orlando Sequera: going back to the quiz.

1690
03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:57.470
Orlando Sequera: If it's only and I saw this question repeated multiple times in the Q. A. The second question, If it's only one option.

1691
03:08:57.650 --> 03:09:10.989
Orlando Sequera: then the correct up, the correct answer is B. The product broke map that's going to provide that overview of the work ahead if it's only one option the correct option. Here, for the second question

1692
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:26.039
Orlando Sequera: Ank Fan wants to give the executive team an overview of the work ahead of the next strategy meeting, Which artifact should he show them and the wasteworded They're asking in this specific case for one option. So for those of you that said, be for a romance that is correct.

1693
03:09:26.270 --> 03:09:27.690
Orlando Sequera: So my apologies.

1694
03:09:28.430 --> 03:09:33.650
Orlando Sequera: but it's probably a a a title that we have to fix my apologies for that.

1695
03:09:33.660 --> 03:09:59.400
Orlando Sequera: But if it's only one option, the correct answer is option. B. But my recommendation for the Pmp. Exam. Always pay attention to how many options are they asking you? They might, they might say, pick 2, or choose to choose 3, pay attention to that. But if it's only one, then it's going to be one in the exam. That's not going to happen. This is not going to happen in the exam.

1696
03:09:59.410 --> 03:10:02.900
Orlando Sequera: So, but the correct answer will be. If it's only one

1697
03:10:02.930 --> 03:10:13.869
Orlando Sequera: item, then it's going to be the correct answer is the pro rope up. All in this case you get to look for the best answer. Okay, so it's only one. Then the best answer is, the pro.

1698
03:10:14.490 --> 03:10:15.310
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1699
03:10:15.490 --> 03:10:17.300
Orlando Sequera: So we, when

1700
03:10:20.490 --> 03:10:23.710
Orlando Sequera: we went over that. That's why

1701
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:27.490
Orlando Sequera: I wanted to. That's what I wanted to clarify.

1702
03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:28.609
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1703
03:10:29.260 --> 03:10:31.620
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with

1704
03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:33.410
Orlando Sequera: our

1705
03:10:34.410 --> 03:10:39.730
Orlando Sequera: topics, please. we're gonna have predetermined a

1706
03:10:40.510 --> 03:10:46.700
Orlando Sequera: stopping points in the class to address questions as they come up. But we're going to continue with our

1707
03:10:46.750 --> 03:10:48.069
Orlando Sequera: with our content.

1708
03:10:49.110 --> 03:10:52.130
Orlando Sequera: Another aspect. I see this. This is

1709
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:53.840
Orlando Sequera: we don't.

1710
03:10:54.050 --> 03:11:10.339
Orlando Sequera: Don't? Get cut up in the minutia for the Pmp. Exam. The the exam is about critical thinking. You need to know about this tools, but they're not asking. They're not trying to determine how well you know them. They're gonna ask you scenario based questions.

1711
03:11:11.210 --> 03:11:25.300
Orlando Sequera: and it you have to answer, based on the tools that we're covering. But it's about critical thinking. The questions are not about definitions and not about the tools they're going to give in. They're going to be giving you scenarios.

1712
03:11:25.310 --> 03:11:31.650
Orlando Sequera: and they're going to be asking you specifically about those scenarios. The questions are going to be, what should you do next?

1713
03:11:31.660 --> 03:11:58.649
Orlando Sequera: What do you do? First you get to look for those keywords again. It's about a critical thinking. It's not about how well do you know these tools and techniques. That's not what the Pmp Exam. Is all about it's about how well can you apply these tools and techniques to solve problems. Okay, so Don't get cut up in the minutia, and if you want to do a deeper dive and understand everything there is to know about this, for example.

1714
03:11:58.700 --> 03:12:00.220
Orlando Sequera: go

1715
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:03.440
Orlando Sequera: A requirements, collection tools.

1716
03:12:04.130 --> 03:12:10.900
Orlando Sequera: review the resources. You have 5,000 pages of resources. Review: the references. Okay.

1717
03:12:11.460 --> 03:12:22.879
Orlando Sequera: But for the Pmp. Exam it's about general understanding, and I'm going to do my best as much as possible to highlight those areas that you need to know for the exam. But it is about critical thinking.

1718
03:12:22.890 --> 03:12:38.090
Orlando Sequera: just knowing a formula by heart or no one, a definition by heart that's not going to caught it. You need to know how to use it. You need to be able. You need to be able to solve problems with a do these tools and technique

1719
03:12:38.610 --> 03:12:39.539
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1720
03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:44.579
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue so, and this goes back to

1721
03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:56.999
Orlando Sequera: another question. that I saw a couple of times in the Q. A. It's about durations, and this goes back to leads and lacks leads and lax are a do. We should not at them

1722
03:12:57.010 --> 03:13:09.950
Orlando Sequera: to the duration, to the estimation process of the duration, right? They're just gonna help us when we start linking those activities that we were able to determine for a project. We have to

1723
03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:18.459
Orlando Sequera: add realism to those and and try to be as efficient as possible. That's where those leads and lacks can help us to build

1724
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:32.959
Orlando Sequera: realism into the schedule. That's what we use it for. But they are not part of the duration. They're not gonna They should not have an impact on determining. How long is it going to take us to a measure. A window or Harle is going to take us to

1725
03:13:32.970 --> 03:13:49.270
Orlando Sequera: install a window. Okay, that that we need to understand specifically about that activity, but leads, and Max have no place when it comes to estimating that duration and estimating the direction of an activity is just that

1726
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:57.959
Orlando Sequera: we're taking a look at how long it's going to take us, how much time is going to take us to complete a specific activity. And

1727
03:13:58.020 --> 03:14:09.530
Orlando Sequera: also we take a look at. We take a look at the effort that is going to be associated with that. So activity, duration estimates that is the quantitative assessment.

1728
03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:10.280
but

1729
03:14:10.380 --> 03:14:18.150
Orlando Sequera: 20 of us quantitative because we're using it. We're saying that it's going to take 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, if we're using hours

1730
03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:28.610
Orlando Sequera: to do our estimation. But what if we're not sure? Should we estimate using ours, or should we estimate using days? And i'm going to

1731
03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:43.760
Orlando Sequera: I'm. I'm going to on past the chat so you can answer. What do you think that we should use what I i'm not sure. I'm working in in a project. What do I have to review to understand. Should I be you estimated in hours, or estimated in days?

1732
03:14:43.780 --> 03:14:46.250
Orlando Sequera: No, how, what? What do I have to review?

1733
03:14:46.730 --> 03:14:47.789
Orlando Sequera: And

1734
03:14:48.240 --> 03:14:52.370
Orlando Sequera: Nope. I see all of you are putting hours or days. What? What

1735
03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:58.150
Orlando Sequera: artifact, what not a matter of fact, what document is going to help you to understand?

1736
03:14:58.710 --> 03:15:01.789
Orlando Sequera: And so far, No, no, no, no, no!

1737
03:15:03.740 --> 03:15:10.109
Orlando Sequera: You have to read your schedule management plan. They plan. You have to review in

1738
03:15:10.310 --> 03:15:17.940
Orlando Sequera: the schedule management plan schedule management plan is going to tell you that the plan? Yes.

1739
03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:19.569
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to post the chat.

1740
03:15:19.730 --> 03:15:20.400
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1741
03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:23.629
Orlando Sequera: that's why we create the plans

1742
03:15:23.660 --> 03:15:27.800
Orlando Sequera: to answer those questions. So we don't have to reinvent the wheel and start a.

1743
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:40.069
Orlando Sequera: What what do we estimate in? Do we use ours to? We use days? No, that's why we create the plans. Another analogy that that I can come up with a to for you to understand the plans.

1744
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:41.820
Orlando Sequera: The different

1745
03:15:41.870 --> 03:15:44.140
Orlando Sequera: project plans that we have in our project

1746
03:15:44.190 --> 03:15:50.390
Orlando Sequera: is a the rules that we have to follow. Let's assume that we're talking about a sport

1747
03:15:50.890 --> 03:15:52.890
Orlando Sequera: to football or soccer.

1748
03:15:53.070 --> 03:16:01.890
Orlando Sequera: The rules right? So we got to have rules, otherwise we wouldn't be able to play the game. We need to have rules or rule book in place.

1749
03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:05.670
Orlando Sequera: so we can play the game. It's the same with the

1750
03:16:06.560 --> 03:16:16.930
Orlando Sequera: the project management plan and the subsidiary plans like in this specific example, the schedule management plan. That's why we create them. So we know it.

1751
03:16:16.970 --> 03:16:32.720
Orlando Sequera: Wait a second. It's not gonna be in days. It's gonna be now worse. So you should estimate. When you get to this point, you estimate using hours. Because why? Because that's what we said that we were going to do in When we develop our schedule management plan.

1752
03:16:32.860 --> 03:16:52.030
Orlando Sequera: we can build that later we build the plans before, so we so we can then execute based on those plans. Okay, that's what we have them. Therefore, so we estimate the duration of the activities based on in the number of time periods. But what time period are we talking about days or hours? Well.

1753
03:16:52.040 --> 03:17:01.030
Orlando Sequera: we review the plan. The plan says Days, or the plan 6 h. That's what you're going to be use. So you take a look into account.

1754
03:17:01.090 --> 03:17:04.579
Orlando Sequera: You're going to estimate the duration of your activities.

1755
03:17:05.440 --> 03:17:21.489
Orlando Sequera: You don't take into account any leads or lags. Okay, no. The only the duration of the actual activity activity. And then the lapse time is the actual calendar time that is needed for an activities come on like an activities completion.

1756
03:17:21.530 --> 03:17:33.850
Orlando Sequera: and then the effort is the number of labor units required to complete a schedule activity that is expressing our days or weeks based on what was said in your

1757
03:17:34.590 --> 03:17:37.919
Orlando Sequera: in this case schedule management plan. Okay.

1758
03:17:38.770 --> 03:17:39.600
Orlando Sequera: All right.

1759
03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:52.030
Orlando Sequera: What are some of those estimating techniques? And before that I will like to point out something, you may be. Wonder what is an estimate? I'm surprised that no one has asked that question in the Q. And a.

1760
03:17:52.040 --> 03:18:01.900
Orlando Sequera: An estimate is not not nothing but an approximation. An estimate is an approximation based on what

1761
03:18:02.220 --> 03:18:03.510
Orlando Sequera: based on

1762
03:18:03.700 --> 03:18:06.320
Orlando Sequera: experience based on

1763
03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:08.110
Orlando Sequera: parameters.

1764
03:18:08.370 --> 03:18:11.930
Orlando Sequera: or we can get a little bit more scientific.

1765
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:20.700
Orlando Sequera: So we have multiple estimating techniques. But at the end of the day. An estimation is an approximation. Please remember that

1766
03:18:20.860 --> 03:18:29.089
Orlando Sequera: next, an estimate, an estimate is an approximation. Okay, we have multiple estimating techniques that we can use.

1767
03:18:29.180 --> 03:18:32.289
Orlando Sequera: The first one that we see here is

1768
03:18:32.540 --> 03:18:34.780
Orlando Sequera: the analogous estimating technique.

1769
03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:43.660
Orlando Sequera: This is basically comparing, using historical data, comparing to a similar endeavor a similar project that we have worked in the past.

1770
03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:47.790
Orlando Sequera: Quick example. Building the house, building a one-story house

1771
03:18:47.970 --> 03:18:50.500
Orlando Sequera: in the past. We built a similar house.

1772
03:18:50.550 --> 03:18:57.920
Orlando Sequera: and it took us 6 months. Therefore i'm going to estimate that we're an estimate that this project is going to take 6 months to complete.

1773
03:18:57.940 --> 03:19:01.020
Orlando Sequera: or we can be a specific about an activity

1774
03:19:01.170 --> 03:19:04.439
Orlando Sequera: installing the windows, for

1775
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:08.120
Orlando Sequera: at one story house it took 3 weeks.

1776
03:19:08.210 --> 03:19:16.530
Orlando Sequera: Therefore we're working in a similar house. We're going to estimate that it's going to take us 3 weeks to install the exterior windows, for example.

1777
03:19:16.700 --> 03:19:24.569
Orlando Sequera: or you can use that for cost. It's not only for duration. It's also used for cost. It's comparing to something similar that was done in the past.

1778
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:28.699
Orlando Sequera: It's great as a starting point, as you can see. Is

1779
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:30.589
Orlando Sequera: not time consuming at all.

1780
03:19:30.680 --> 03:19:43.620
Orlando Sequera: and it's not expensive. We just did it in what a couple of seconds right? And this is used as a starting point. But the problem is, the drawback is that it's not accurate.

1781
03:19:50.860 --> 03:20:09.179
Orlando Sequera: is it? It's not really accurate. It's a good as probably some of you that they're working in construction. No, a materials and supplies. The prices are changing on a weekly basis, or in some cases in a on a daily basis. So and they resource. Availability is also another another factor. So.

1782
03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:18.239
Orlando Sequera: for they to find construction workers in some cases. So there are many variables, many factors that come into place. So this might be

1783
03:20:18.330 --> 03:20:27.599
Orlando Sequera: That that was the case 6 months or a 2 years ago right now is different. So we got to keep that into account. But it's a good starting point

1784
03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:33.890
Orlando Sequera: we can use also what we call parametric estimation. This is a little bit more scientific.

1785
03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:36.470
Orlando Sequera: and this is where we can start saying

1786
03:20:37.010 --> 03:20:51.919
Orlando Sequera: we can start using some parameters. So okay, let's assume that we're trying to estimate the duration of a task. That is, we we're painting one of the we're printing the master bedroom in the in. The one

1787
03:20:52.030 --> 03:20:54.190
Orlando Sequera: one story has that we're building.

1788
03:20:54.600 --> 03:21:10.910
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so we can use some a, some parameters. So if we use each painter is gonna it's gonna take one painter. It will take 3 h to complete the task. Then, if we use 2, maybe we can produce that to an hour and a half

1789
03:21:10.970 --> 03:21:20.079
Orlando Sequera: A. So we can. Then we 2 painters. This is going to take us an hour and a half, so we start getting a a little bit more scientific. We're using parameters.

1790
03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:21.909
Orlando Sequera: We can also use cost

1791
03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:33.229
Orlando Sequera: or duration. So with 2 painters gonna take us an hour and a half, but each payer the hourly rate is $30 an hour, for example. So when we start using

1792
03:21:33.930 --> 03:21:53.830
Orlando Sequera: those parameters for cost in those parameters for a duration, that's what we call parametric estimation. By doing that we can determine how long it's going to take, or how much is going to cost a specific activity. They are more accurate than analogous estimating.

1793
03:21:53.920 --> 03:21:54.960
Orlando Sequera: But

1794
03:21:55.140 --> 03:22:03.659
Orlando Sequera: they don't take they they're not a silver bullet they don't. Take into account a like a learning curve. If, for example.

1795
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:06.180
Orlando Sequera: going back to the example of pain in the room.

1796
03:22:06.460 --> 03:22:09.449
Orlando Sequera: what happens if we have a

1797
03:22:10.120 --> 03:22:12.390
Orlando Sequera: painters that are very experienced.

1798
03:22:12.430 --> 03:22:21.839
Orlando Sequera: But then we have someone that is that that just started as a painter. So doesn't take those variables into account, so it's not always

1799
03:22:21.880 --> 03:22:22.920
Orlando Sequera: a

1800
03:22:23.170 --> 03:22:32.140
Orlando Sequera: the uniform when it comes to results. So the recommendation is to use more than just that, a estimating technique.

1801
03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:35.220
Orlando Sequera: Then we have another estimating technique.

1802
03:22:35.310 --> 03:22:52.319
Orlando Sequera: and we're gonna look at it in a little in a little more detail in the next slide. It's what we call the 3 Point estimating technique. And here we take into account 3 scenarios. We're trying to come up with an approximate range, and the 3 scenarios are best case scenario.

1803
03:22:53.480 --> 03:23:05.520
Orlando Sequera: We have worst case scenario, and but in the middle we have the most likely scenario, and we use this whenever historical data is insufficient or very subjective.

1804
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:09.989
Orlando Sequera: and this can help us to include the level of accuracy. But

1805
03:23:10.370 --> 03:23:16.729
Orlando Sequera: it has some drawbacks as well. It requires detailed resource information, and it also requires

1806
03:23:16.780 --> 03:23:31.809
Orlando Sequera: expert knowledge in order to estimate those tasks before we get a lot of questions. Can you explain more? 3 point? We're gonna we're gonna look at that in the next slide. In a little more detail. There are a couple of formulas. There are a couple of ways that we can do the 3 point estimating technique.

1807
03:23:31.830 --> 03:23:32.640
Orlando Sequera: A

1808
03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:34.309
Orlando Sequera: one is the triangular

1809
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:48.020
Orlando Sequera: formula, the triangular distribution, that is basically adding the 3 scenarios and dividing by 3 and calculating an average. Or we can use the beta distribution distribution, which is the per known as the per

1810
03:23:49.330 --> 03:23:54.129
Orlando Sequera: from a programming graduation review and technique. That is a

1811
03:23:54.230 --> 03:24:00.570
Orlando Sequera: we. And we're going to. We're going to start to look at the differences between the 2 that's going to be in the next slide.

1812
03:24:00.910 --> 03:24:10.939
Orlando Sequera: But then we come down to the most accurate type of estimating technique that we can use. It's called bottom up.

1813
03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:16.329
Orlando Sequera: This is basically done at the lowest level

1814
03:24:16.450 --> 03:24:19.279
Orlando Sequera: of the Wbs. We estimate

1815
03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:23.440
Orlando Sequera: at the lowest level of the Wbs.

1816
03:24:23.770 --> 03:24:30.940
Orlando Sequera: We estimate at the lowest level. The Wvs. I'm going to unposs the chat. Does anybody remember what is the lowest level

1817
03:24:31.620 --> 03:24:33.670
Orlando Sequera: of the Wbs?

1818
03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:38.190
Orlando Sequera: So anybody remember what is the lowest level of the Wbs

1819
03:24:38.230 --> 03:24:42.389
Orlando Sequera: War package. Correct. It is the word package

1820
03:24:42.540 --> 03:24:49.659
Orlando Sequera: under the word package. We have the activities, but it is the word package. Great job, right? I'm going to post it chat

1821
03:24:49.890 --> 03:24:51.360
Orlando Sequera: so we can continue.

1822
03:24:51.750 --> 03:24:52.949
Orlando Sequera: Thank you very much.

1823
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.910
Orlando Sequera: So

1824
03:24:54.130 --> 03:24:54.949
Orlando Sequera: when

1825
03:24:55.450 --> 03:24:57.069
Orlando Sequera: we are

1826
03:24:58.110 --> 03:24:58.890
Orlando Sequera: so

1827
03:24:59.020 --> 03:25:06.010
Orlando Sequera: how can they ask questions related to the estimating techniques in your Pmp. Exempt.

1828
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:10.119
Orlando Sequera: You need to pay attention to the context, the type of question.

1829
03:25:10.430 --> 03:25:18.959
Orlando Sequera: for example, in this scenario question your stakeholders are trying to get a ballpark an idea on how long

1830
03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:31.840
Orlando Sequera: that duration is going to be for a the particular project, what type of estimated technique should you use? What is the best? What is the best option in this scenario? That that's an example.

1831
03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:37.770
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so they're asking you for board per They're asking you to have an idea that is.

1832
03:25:38.330 --> 03:25:51.429
Orlando Sequera: which, based on that which one would you recommend. They're trying to get a ballpark idea on how long it's going to take. They're looking for. They need to have a rough, a rough order of magnitude of R and I'm. I'm going to enforce the chat.

1833
03:25:51.710 --> 03:25:53.299
Orlando Sequera: Which one do you think

1834
03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:56.630
Orlando Sequera: is the best option in that situation.

1835
03:25:58.240 --> 03:26:00.709
Orlando Sequera: Correct, analogous, estimating technique.

1836
03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:02.090
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna

1837
03:26:02.230 --> 03:26:04.699
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna post the chat one more time.

1838
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:07.440
Orlando Sequera: And

1839
03:26:07.630 --> 03:26:10.100
Orlando Sequera: what if they're looking for accuracy.

1840
03:26:10.740 --> 03:26:24.719
Orlando Sequera: Your stakeholders are asking asking for a high level of accuracy when it comes to the estimates they really want to have a solid understanding on how long. It's going to take you to complete the project, which one is

1841
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:27.479
Orlando Sequera: what is the best option in that scenario.

1842
03:26:28.600 --> 03:26:30.580
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna on past the chat

1843
03:26:34.100 --> 03:26:37.320
Orlando Sequera: bottom up correct. So that's how

1844
03:26:37.500 --> 03:26:46.110
Orlando Sequera: you have to pay attention to the scenario questions, and based on that that will They're going to give you some hints on to choose the best option. Okay.

1845
03:26:46.970 --> 03:26:48.510
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to

1846
03:26:49.740 --> 03:26:53.960
Orlando Sequera: the 3 point estimation technique. This is what I was mentioning. Before

1847
03:26:55.130 --> 03:26:59.149
Orlando Sequera: a we can use. We can calculate an average.

1848
03:26:59.350 --> 03:27:13.820
Orlando Sequera: we can calculate an average, and then we add the 3 scenarios assume that that we are trying to determine the duration of completing the let's assume that the task is to comp

1849
03:27:13.830 --> 03:27:26.039
Orlando Sequera: pain in the house, painting the entire house internally and externally. So best case scenario is gonna be it's gonna take us 3 weeks. The optimistics and error best case in there. It's going to be 3 weeks to complete pain in the house.

1850
03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:28.000
Orlando Sequera: Most likely

1851
03:27:28.490 --> 03:27:30.239
Orlando Sequera: it's going to be 5 weeks.

1852
03:27:30.300 --> 03:27:31.449
Orlando Sequera: But then.

1853
03:27:31.680 --> 03:27:36.230
Orlando Sequera: worst case scenario or pessimistic. It is going to be 10 weeks right? So

1854
03:27:37.380 --> 03:27:41.109
Orlando Sequera: we can. If we're using the triangular distribution. We can

1855
03:27:41.680 --> 03:27:44.620
Orlando Sequera: add the 3 scenarios, and then

1856
03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:45.789
Orlando Sequera: the

1857
03:27:45.960 --> 03:28:01.159
Orlando Sequera: th, the 3 scenarios, and divided by 3, and in this specific case it's going to be 6 weeks. So census our it's going to take a 6 weeks to complete painting that task. The the activity of painting, the the entire house internally on external.

1858
03:28:01.440 --> 03:28:02.360
Orlando Sequera: But

1859
03:28:02.430 --> 03:28:03.829
Orlando Sequera: we also have

1860
03:28:03.900 --> 03:28:06.599
Orlando Sequera: the beta distribution or per.

1861
03:28:07.260 --> 03:28:11.009
Orlando Sequera: and it's a little bit different. We are

1862
03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:19.759
Orlando Sequera: given more where they the weight that we give to the most likely scenario is, we're going to multiply that by 4.

1863
03:28:19.810 --> 03:28:20.619
Orlando Sequera: So

1864
03:28:20.810 --> 03:28:21.510
Orlando Sequera: they

1865
03:28:21.620 --> 03:28:31.629
Orlando Sequera: for them realize gonna be the optimistic scenario. 3 weeks plus, they waited, most likely estimate, which is 5 weeks times 4.

1866
03:28:32.140 --> 03:28:33.020
Orlando Sequera: Floss.

1867
03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:43.439
Orlando Sequera: The worst case scenario, which is 10 weeks or pessimistic estimate right? So the calculation we perform the calculation, and it's going to be 5.5 weeks.

1868
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:46.660
Orlando Sequera: You might be wondering why.

1869
03:28:47.780 --> 03:29:01.580
Orlando Sequera: when should we use the beta distribution whenever we have access to experts to subject matter experts the best. If we have such a matter expert, we can use the beta distribution because

1870
03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:20.829
Orlando Sequera: they know they have been there. They have done that. We have that expertise. Then, if we have that expertise available, then we can use the Beta distribution, and we can come up with an estimate that it's going to be more accurate. We give more because chances are that it's going to be closer to the most likely scenario. That's when we use the beta distribution.

1871
03:29:20.850 --> 03:29:28.379
Orlando Sequera: Okay. But if you can see, the results are awfully similar with the with the access to the experts, it's gonna take us

1872
03:29:28.450 --> 03:29:29.499
Orlando Sequera: half a week

1873
03:29:29.710 --> 03:29:35.810
Orlando Sequera: last time in in in the the the estimates. It is

1874
03:29:35.830 --> 03:29:43.789
Orlando Sequera: half a week before then, not having access to those experts. Okay, so this is how we calculate the

1875
03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:47.180
Orlando Sequera: The actual beta distribution is.

1876
03:29:47.490 --> 03:29:50.400
Orlando Sequera: we add, the optimistic scenario plus

1877
03:29:50.500 --> 03:29:58.239
Orlando Sequera: 4 times the most likely scenario plus the pessimistic scenario. And we divide that by 6. Okay.

1878
03:29:58.760 --> 03:29:59.539
Orlando Sequera: all right.

1879
03:30:03.250 --> 03:30:06.950
Orlando Sequera: critical path. We have been

1880
03:30:07.020 --> 03:30:12.700
Orlando Sequera: a mention in the critical path. So let's put everything that we have

1881
03:30:12.860 --> 03:30:15.430
Orlando Sequera: that that that we have been talking about the

1882
03:30:15.580 --> 03:30:29.489
Orlando Sequera: here, the dependencies and linking the activities together. That's how we build the schedule, but and that's how we build an actual what You see, here is what we call a network diagram. Okay?

1883
03:30:29.700 --> 03:30:30.670
Orlando Sequera: And

1884
03:30:33.240 --> 03:30:38.730
Orlando Sequera: the critical path, by the way, is the most common schedule management

1885
03:30:38.810 --> 03:30:43.140
Orlando Sequera: technique that is used in predictive approaches.

1886
03:30:43.170 --> 03:30:43.880
Orlando Sequera: Hey?

1887
03:30:44.230 --> 03:30:45.990
Orlando Sequera: Each activity is going to be

1888
03:30:46.010 --> 03:30:52.950
Orlando Sequera: one box, and they're gonna it's gonna have its duration. In this case we're using weeks, not days, right.

1889
03:30:53.140 --> 03:31:05.740
Orlando Sequera: And and we just have to follow the arrows they are. They're indicating that dependencies. So you can see that, for example, the predecessor of activity, one is start.

1890
03:31:05.970 --> 03:31:07.100
Orlando Sequera: and then

1891
03:31:07.180 --> 03:31:09.089
Orlando Sequera: for activity.

1892
03:31:10.080 --> 03:31:13.870
Orlando Sequera: a for activity, one activity. One has 2

1893
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:23.309
Orlando Sequera: successors, activity to an activity, 3. So you just follow the arrows right? What happens before predecessor. What happens later? The successor.

1894
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:25.440
Orlando Sequera: But we need

1895
03:31:25.620 --> 03:31:26.480
Orlando Sequera: 2.

1896
03:31:27.880 --> 03:31:32.800
Orlando Sequera: The goal of the critical path is to determine is to determine

1897
03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:40.850
Orlando Sequera: which of the multiple paths that we have in our product in our network Drag diagram is gonna be the longest path.

1898
03:31:41.240 --> 03:31:43.689
Orlando Sequera: because that longest path

1899
03:31:43.800 --> 03:31:53.410
Orlando Sequera: it's going to be the critical path of our project. It's going to tell us how long it's going to take us to complete our project. At least

1900
03:31:53.520 --> 03:31:59.869
Orlando Sequera: it's the longest path. I know that it gets confusing at the beginning. We have to calculate the longest path.

1901
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:10.250
Orlando Sequera: because that's gonna tell us the shortest amount of time that is gonna take us to complete our project. So let's start by

1902
03:32:10.760 --> 03:32:22.080
Orlando Sequera: working on that, trying to understand that with this information that we have here, I see initially, at least in this network diagram 2 paths. We are going to follow them. So we have.

1903
03:32:22.460 --> 03:32:25.909
Orlando Sequera: We have start. Then we move on to activity, one

1904
03:32:26.760 --> 03:32:27.740
Orlando Sequera: in.

1905
03:32:28.090 --> 03:32:29.789
Orlando Sequera: Let's go over

1906
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:41.320
Orlando Sequera: this path here. Following this this path from activity one we go to activity 2, and adding right the duration 6 weeks, 6 weeks, plus 4 weeks. That's 10 weeks.

1907
03:32:41.770 --> 03:32:43.649
Orlando Sequera: plus 3 weeks.

1908
03:32:43.880 --> 03:32:45.680
Orlando Sequera: the duration of activity 4

1909
03:32:46.310 --> 03:32:51.729
Orlando Sequera: that is, 13 weeks right, and then the next activity is activity 6,

1910
03:32:51.750 --> 03:32:56.260
Orlando Sequera: which is one week in duration. So the path, the first path

1911
03:32:56.380 --> 03:32:57.260
Orlando Sequera: is

1912
03:32:57.460 --> 03:33:02.490
Orlando Sequera: the duration is 14 weeks. What we see here. But then we have a second path.

1913
03:33:02.540 --> 03:33:05.310
Orlando Sequera: which is activity 1 6 weeks.

1914
03:33:05.360 --> 03:33:10.400
Orlando Sequera: plus the duration of activity 3, which is 5 weeks. That's 11 weeks right.

1915
03:33:10.470 --> 03:33:13.759
Orlando Sequera: plus the duration of activity 5, that is, 4 weeks.

1916
03:33:15.250 --> 03:33:17.189
Orlando Sequera: That is 15

1917
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:18.199
Orlando Sequera: weeks right.

1918
03:33:18.360 --> 03:33:22.140
Orlando Sequera: plus the duration of activity. 6, that is, one week.

1919
03:33:22.310 --> 03:33:25.600
Orlando Sequera: and that is 16 weeks, which one is longer.

1920
03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:28.000
Orlando Sequera: This path right here

1921
03:33:28.020 --> 03:33:32.179
Orlando Sequera: in this network diagram. This is the critical path.

1922
03:33:32.880 --> 03:33:39.960
Orlando Sequera: what this is telling us, and this is something that is really important for you to remember, for the exam for the exam.

1923
03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:42.720
Orlando Sequera: What they're looking for is

1924
03:33:43.420 --> 03:33:45.950
Orlando Sequera: this for the interpretation?

1925
03:33:46.020 --> 03:33:49.450
Orlando Sequera: You need to understand what the critical path is.

1926
03:33:49.550 --> 03:33:50.400
Orlando Sequera: If

1927
03:33:50.570 --> 03:34:04.229
Orlando Sequera: for this project is gonna take us at least 16 weeks to complete it. Hey? It's gonna take us at least 16 weeks to complete this project. That's what the critical path is telling you. You might be wondering.

1928
03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:11.770
Orlando Sequera: Ornando. But what do I do if my project has 500 or a 1,000 activities, what do I do? In that case.

1929
03:34:11.960 --> 03:34:30.880
Orlando Sequera: remember, we can always, and in in our daily lives as a project man as project managers, we use software Microsoft Project is going to calculate the critical path for you, for example, if that if that's a tool that you're using. But you need to understand where it comes from. Okay.

1930
03:34:30.890 --> 03:34:33.960
Orlando Sequera: And another important aspect of

1931
03:34:34.810 --> 03:34:36.180
Orlando Sequera: the freak or path

1932
03:34:36.230 --> 03:34:42.059
Orlando Sequera: is that those activities that are part of the critical path, they cannot be delayed.

1933
03:34:42.570 --> 03:34:50.290
Orlando Sequera: If, in this specific case, if activity, one activity, 3 activity, 5 or activity. 6. Get delayed.

1934
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:52.470
Orlando Sequera: Your entire project

1935
03:34:52.650 --> 03:34:54.960
Orlando Sequera: is going to be delayed.

1936
03:34:54.980 --> 03:35:02.360
Orlando Sequera: Hey? You have to safeguard. You might be wondering again Another question that i'm surprised that Hasn't come up here

1937
03:35:04.060 --> 03:35:06.829
Orlando Sequera: Your pro You might be wondering

1938
03:35:06.850 --> 03:35:25.120
Orlando Sequera: Why is it so important to calculate the quicker path? Because we need to know those activities that are part of the quicker path, so we safeguard, so we protect them because they cannot be delayed otherwise. Our entire project is going to be delayed, and we cannot. We cannot allow that to happen. That's

1939
03:35:25.130 --> 03:35:34.010
Orlando Sequera: the importance and and the the added value that comes with using the critical path. Super super super important.

1940
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:37.840
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

1941
03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:43.829
Orlando Sequera: And we're gonna answer the questions. a little bit later.

1942
03:35:44.020 --> 03:35:45.410
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more.

1943
03:35:45.530 --> 03:35:52.109
Orlando Sequera: This is a demonstration. I'm: I want to give you some some guidance here. This is just

1944
03:35:52.390 --> 03:35:53.330
Orlando Sequera: a

1945
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:55.030
Orlando Sequera: just an example

1946
03:35:55.820 --> 03:36:03.720
Orlando Sequera: to understand a little bit more about the critical path for the exam for the exam. You need to.

1947
03:36:03.740 --> 03:36:04.570
Orlando Sequera: A

1948
03:36:04.680 --> 03:36:20.779
Orlando Sequera: chances are that they, in previous versions of the Pmp. Exam. And going back to one of the questions I was yesterday. Yes, you had some questions before 2,021. There were some questions in which you could see a network diagram like this. And they will ask you

1949
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:26.010
Orlando Sequera: to calculate the critical path, and they will ask you questions about that critical path.

1950
03:36:26.060 --> 03:36:28.650
Orlando Sequera: My recommendation is

1951
03:36:30.250 --> 03:36:31.100
Orlando Sequera: that

1952
03:36:31.140 --> 03:36:34.230
Orlando Sequera: it is very important to understand what it is.

1953
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:36.930
Orlando Sequera: you can learn how to calculate it.

1954
03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:55.210
Orlando Sequera: and we can go over this exercise to add a little bit more, To understand it a little bit more. But the questions that you're going to get in your Pmp. Exam are about interpretation. If If you get a question on curriculum path they are going to be. They are going to

1955
03:36:55.220 --> 03:37:04.939
Orlando Sequera: they They are going to make sure that you understand the interpretation of the concept of the critical path, and you might be wondering, how can we get ready for that? Well

1956
03:37:05.170 --> 03:37:06.020
Orlando Sequera: take

1957
03:37:06.130 --> 03:37:10.740
Orlando Sequera: practice questions in test prep. Go to percipio and

1958
03:37:10.820 --> 03:37:15.179
Orlando Sequera: use test prep to to take practice questions. You're going to get

1959
03:37:15.290 --> 03:37:25.400
Orlando Sequera: great exposure to the type of questions. That's one thing that i'm also saying in the Q. And a. You're getting caught up in the minutia of things. That's not what the P. Beings.

1960
03:37:25.730 --> 03:37:30.589
Orlando Sequera: what the Pmp. Exam. Is all about. It's about critical thinking. Okay, they

1961
03:37:31.300 --> 03:37:40.239
Orlando Sequera: it is important. Yes, to understand these tools, but the minutia is not what's going to get you there. Critical thinking is what's going to get you there. So

1962
03:37:40.490 --> 03:37:42.959
Orlando Sequera: in this case we have

1963
03:37:43.810 --> 03:37:47.609
Orlando Sequera: basically to calculate the critical path. And

1964
03:37:47.920 --> 03:37:49.680
Orlando Sequera: with this exercise

1965
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:52.010
Orlando Sequera: A:

1966
03:37:52.140 --> 03:38:01.049
Orlando Sequera: This is going to show you the number of paths that we have. We need to have a multiple errors. And then basically what we're going to be doing is to calculate

1967
03:38:01.340 --> 03:38:02.090
Orlando Sequera: they

1968
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:03.980
Orlando Sequera: the longest path.

1969
03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:10.189
Orlando Sequera: And that's what's gonna take that's what's gonna help us to understand if we have

1970
03:38:10.260 --> 03:38:13.100
Orlando Sequera: which one of these path is the longest path.

1971
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:17.880
Orlando Sequera: A another aspect that we have to take into account is that

1972
03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:26.140
Orlando Sequera: activities that are part of the quicker path have some have no flow, meaning that they cannot be delayed.

1973
03:38:26.260 --> 03:38:26.970
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

1974
03:38:27.270 --> 03:38:29.079
Orlando Sequera: I can tell you that

1975
03:38:30.200 --> 03:38:31.630
Orlando Sequera: activity. B.

1976
03:38:32.350 --> 03:38:45.640
Orlando Sequera: You can calculate the flow by the way, by subtracting your late finish minus your early finish, which is what? Look at the key here. This this let me explain the key first, and let's go over this exercise.

1977
03:38:45.740 --> 03:38:54.149
Orlando Sequera: But again, I just want to illustrate the point of what the critical path is, how can we do it? And then how can we?

1978
03:38:54.270 --> 03:38:55.289
Orlando Sequera: How can we

1979
03:38:55.420 --> 03:39:05.349
Orlando Sequera: put that into into effect? Put that to a test if it's the longest path. Indeed. Okay, this key here is early start. Es stands for early start.

1980
03:39:05.970 --> 03:39:07.510
Orlando Sequera: This is the duration.

1981
03:39:08.140 --> 03:39:10.970
Orlando Sequera: This is going to be early finish.

1982
03:39:11.300 --> 03:39:12.170
Orlando Sequera: Then

1983
03:39:12.270 --> 03:39:17.649
Orlando Sequera: Ls stands for early for late start. I'm sorry, then float

1984
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:19.600
Orlando Sequera: and then late finish.

1985
03:39:19.660 --> 03:39:20.380
Orlando Sequera: So

1986
03:39:20.650 --> 03:39:34.109
Orlando Sequera: the first path I here we start with start. We always start. We we start start, and then we move on through the path, and then we start, and then we complete the network diagram with finish or end.

1987
03:39:34.430 --> 03:39:44.969
Orlando Sequera: right. So the first path that we see here. So the duration is 3. We can say 3 days for 6 of the exercise, and then activity a.

1988
03:39:46.020 --> 03:39:47.969
Orlando Sequera: How do we calculate the float.

1989
03:39:48.220 --> 03:39:53.489
Orlando Sequera: your activity. You're going to subtract your

1990
03:39:53.600 --> 03:40:01.209
Orlando Sequera: from your late finished You're going to subtract your early finish, and if it's a 0 that means that this activity has.

1991
03:40:01.490 --> 03:40:05.969
Orlando Sequera: But chances are that that activity is going to be part of the frequent path.

1992
03:40:06.370 --> 03:40:07.510
Orlando Sequera: You do the same

1993
03:40:07.570 --> 03:40:09.500
Orlando Sequera: here to double, check

1994
03:40:09.630 --> 03:40:11.180
Orlando Sequera: to start, and the late start.

1995
03:40:11.300 --> 03:40:14.470
Orlando Sequera: You subtract a the early start

1996
03:40:14.570 --> 03:40:17.699
Orlando Sequera: from the late start. So one minus one that is 0,

1997
03:40:17.730 --> 03:40:23.749
Orlando Sequera: just to double check, and then the duration is 3. But what is the duration of this path

1998
03:40:24.190 --> 03:40:25.619
Orlando Sequera: following a

1999
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:26.710
Orlando Sequera: See

2000
03:40:27.490 --> 03:40:28.380
Orlando Sequera: if

2001
03:40:28.440 --> 03:40:31.590
Orlando Sequera: and what is the duration of that path? I'm gonna

2002
03:40:31.880 --> 03:40:33.050
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna

2003
03:40:33.530 --> 03:40:34.840
Orlando Sequera: on past the chat.

2004
03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:37.629
Orlando Sequera: What is the duration of that path?

2005
03:40:40.200 --> 03:40:43.000
Orlando Sequera: So 3 plus 2, 5 days.

2006
03:40:43.310 --> 03:40:44.520
Orlando Sequera: plus 3,

2007
03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:47.150
Orlando Sequera: 8,

2008
03:40:47.220 --> 03:40:48.360
Orlando Sequera: and right.

2009
03:40:48.470 --> 03:40:49.860
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So it's 8.

2010
03:40:51.820 --> 03:40:53.170
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna post the chat.

2011
03:40:54.350 --> 03:40:57.500
Orlando Sequera: Then what about this path? Activity: a

2012
03:40:57.940 --> 03:40:59.210
Orlando Sequera: activity D:

2013
03:40:59.870 --> 03:41:01.860
Orlando Sequera: Activity F.

2014
03:41:02.720 --> 03:41:03.490
Orlando Sequera: And

2015
03:41:06.540 --> 03:41:08.280
Orlando Sequera: what is the duration of that path?

2016
03:41:13.690 --> 03:41:15.730
Orlando Sequera: That's 10 right. That is correct.

2017
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:17.309
Orlando Sequera: 3 plus 4,

2018
03:41:17.690 --> 03:41:19.990
Orlando Sequera: 7, plus 3, that is 10.

2019
03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:29.270
Orlando Sequera: When I post a chat, and then what about the one at the bottom? So we go. Activity B for?

2020
03:41:30.890 --> 03:41:32.570
Orlando Sequera: And then activity.

2021
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:38.860
Orlando Sequera: activity, E?

2022
03:41:38.960 --> 03:41:41.990
Orlando Sequera: 4. And what is the duration of that path?

2023
03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:50.160
Orlando Sequera: So 4

2024
03:41:51.320 --> 03:41:53.179
Orlando Sequera: plus 4, and

2025
03:41:54.390 --> 03:41:55.650
Orlando Sequera: so that's 8

2026
03:41:57.080 --> 03:41:57.830
Orlando Sequera: correct.

2027
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:10.979
Orlando Sequera: So you gotta look at the duration.

2028
03:42:11.300 --> 03:42:13.899
Orlando Sequera: and that's what's gonna tell us.

2029
03:42:14.090 --> 03:42:20.869
Orlando Sequera: That's what the longest duration, the longest path that's going to be the critical path. So which one is the critical path.

2030
03:42:29.530 --> 03:42:35.100
Orlando Sequera: and we have another path in there, too, Are we missing? We're missing one path. We're missing one path.

2031
03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:37.300
Orlando Sequera: So what about

2032
03:42:37.350 --> 03:42:38.300
Orlando Sequera: A.

2033
03:42:39.220 --> 03:42:40.240
Orlando Sequera: The

2034
03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.840
Orlando Sequera: E.

2035
03:42:45.150 --> 03:42:47.030
Orlando Sequera: What is the duration of that path?

2036
03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:49.180
Orlando Sequera: A. D. E.

2037
03:42:49.900 --> 03:42:50.990
Orlando Sequera: 11.

2038
03:42:52.190 --> 03:42:55.349
Orlando Sequera: So based on that which one is the longest path.

2039
03:42:58.490 --> 03:43:02.009
Orlando Sequera: a de that is the critical path correct?

2040
03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:04.430
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2041
03:43:05.340 --> 03:43:06.020
Orlando Sequera: So

2042
03:43:06.780 --> 03:43:07.619
Orlando Sequera: start

2043
03:43:08.020 --> 03:43:12.060
Orlando Sequera: a D. E. And that is the critical path.

2044
03:43:12.140 --> 03:43:14.040
Orlando Sequera: It's 11 days.

2045
03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:15.109
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2046
03:43:15.170 --> 03:43:15.960
Orlando Sequera: So

2047
03:43:17.060 --> 03:43:20.249
Orlando Sequera: let's take a look at the float. What I told you before.

2048
03:43:20.370 --> 03:43:22.640
Orlando Sequera: Those activities are part of the critical path.

2049
03:43:24.700 --> 03:43:26.589
Orlando Sequera: Let's put that to the test.

2050
03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:28.350
Orlando Sequera: What flow do they have?

2051
03:43:28.420 --> 03:43:30.079
Orlando Sequera: Let's take activity. E:

2052
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:40.030
Orlando Sequera: If you subtract the early finish from the late finish for activity, E: 11 minus 11. That is a big 5, 0, right, 11 minus 11.

2053
03:43:40.090 --> 03:43:42.609
Orlando Sequera: And then what about the lay-star, namely, start

2054
03:43:43.140 --> 03:43:51.430
Orlando Sequera: 8 minus 8 0. That means this activity has no float activity. E 0 float whatever activity D:

2055
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:55.310
Orlando Sequera: 7 minus 7, 0, 4 minus 4 0.

2056
03:43:55.370 --> 03:44:05.900
Orlando Sequera: No float. They cannot be delayed. That's what it means. And then activity a same thing, 3 minus 3, 0, one minus 1 0. But what about activity? C.

2057
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:08.790
Orlando Sequera: What is the flow for activity? See.

2058
03:44:10.460 --> 03:44:13.340
Orlando Sequera: i'm gonna impose a chat. What's the flow for activity? See.

2059
03:44:13.810 --> 03:44:15.399
Orlando Sequera: it is 3 right.

2060
03:44:15.860 --> 03:44:18.049
Orlando Sequera: 8 minus 5, 3,

2061
03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:21.729
Orlando Sequera: 7, minus 4, 3. So it is 3 days.

2062
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:24.050
Orlando Sequera: That means that

2063
03:44:25.700 --> 03:44:28.630
Orlando Sequera: i'm. Posting the chat again. That means that

2064
03:44:29.420 --> 03:44:44.829
Orlando Sequera: as long as activity. These no activity. See in this case. I'm: sorry it's not delay for more than 3 days. We are okay. We have up to 3 days for activity, c. To be delayed. Now, if we get to late 4 days, then our project is going to be late.

2065
03:44:44.860 --> 03:44:49.450
Orlando Sequera: but we have some. We we have some buffer Here we have some float.

2066
03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:51.489
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by float

2067
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:59.400
Orlando Sequera: that's going to happen only for activities that are not part of the critical path, any activity that is part of the critical path.

2068
03:44:59.870 --> 03:45:18.940
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna have a float off 0. You cannot allow those activities to be delayed, otherwise your entire project is going to be delayed. Okay, super super, super, important to understand when it comes to a quicker path if the longest path.

2069
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:24.320
Orlando Sequera: But it's the shortest time that it's gonna take you to complete this project in this case.

2070
03:45:24.570 --> 03:45:28.719
Orlando Sequera: How many days at least it's gonna take you to complete this project

2071
03:45:29.610 --> 03:45:32.349
Orlando Sequera: and then go to unprof the chat. How many days at least.

2072
03:45:32.500 --> 03:45:39.779
Orlando Sequera: gonna take it to complete this product? It's gonna take you at least 11 days to complete this project, because that's the longest path.

2073
03:45:39.930 --> 03:45:42.490
Orlando Sequera: That is the definition of the critical path.

2074
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:43.380
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2075
03:45:44.140 --> 03:45:45.409
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to post the chat.

2076
03:45:46.060 --> 03:45:46.960
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2077
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:52.519
Orlando Sequera: A little bit more about the project Schedule

2078
03:45:52.610 --> 03:45:57.390
Orlando Sequera: reschedule is putting all that information together. It covers

2079
03:45:57.620 --> 03:46:02.670
Orlando Sequera: start and finish activities. We link the dependencies. We use our presence

2080
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:05.560
Orlando Sequera: diagramming method with the dependencies.

2081
03:46:05.810 --> 03:46:09.819
Orlando Sequera: Our a all of that is

2082
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:20.520
Orlando Sequera: is included. We have a certain sequence with certain dates. We have dates for project milestones. Remember that our milestone is an actual.

2083
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:38.649
Orlando Sequera: significant event that occurs in our project. This is what's going to help us to coordinate activities to make sure that we have an on Time Project Completion. That's the beauty of the project scheduled, and it's also going to help us to track our progress based on scheduled performance

2084
03:46:38.660 --> 03:46:57.030
Orlando Sequera: and based on a, and it's also gonna allow us to provide visibility to upper management so they can understand our project Progress right? So it is a key element of any project they can be presented in multiple formats. Right? If we are using

2085
03:46:57.890 --> 03:47:05.049
Orlando Sequera: predictive approach is very common to present the schedule using a game chart. That is one view.

2086
03:47:05.190 --> 03:47:23.990
Orlando Sequera: a possible view, and we're going to see it in the next. Slide off your schedule, showing the milestones and showing the different tasks and the completion and percentages of completion. You can view a milestone chart and then show different bars that can they provide idea on how well we're performing

2087
03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:36.020
Orlando Sequera: based on those milestones or where we are. But if we're following up an adaptive approach, it's very common to use a roadmap, so we can. It then track progress. That's another view.

2088
03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:38.130
Orlando Sequera: Okay, then.

2089
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:43.389
Orlando Sequera: that what is the tool that we use for

2090
03:47:43.410 --> 03:47:48.790
Orlando Sequera: and for scheduling activities in a project plan? That is the scheduled network diagram.

2091
03:47:49.190 --> 03:47:51.470
Orlando Sequera: Okay. And this is a

2092
03:47:51.580 --> 03:48:00.309
Orlando Sequera: graphic representation. This is a an actual example of a game chart. Microsoft project will create this for you. It

2093
03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:19.409
Orlando Sequera: it shows the different activities. So this is, for example, for face one, and these are the different activities we Haven't entered the hours yet, but we assigned these are the resources that are going to be working on those activities, and this is the percentage of progress. And then we can see the dates as well.

2094
03:48:19.420 --> 03:48:37.320
Orlando Sequera: Your stakeholders are usually very well, From familiarized with a cantor, and they can see they can track a comprehensive project. Progress against a the dates that we have in the gutter. That's one of the typical views that you use

2095
03:48:37.330 --> 03:48:39.809
Orlando Sequera: in project management, software like

2096
03:48:39.900 --> 03:48:41.440
Orlando Sequera: Microsoft Project.

2097
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:44.849
Orlando Sequera: Okay, then we have

2098
03:48:45.700 --> 03:48:50.069
Orlando Sequera: another view of the schedule is the milestone schedule.

2099
03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:51.920
Orlando Sequera: This is

2100
03:48:52.200 --> 03:49:09.609
Orlando Sequera: going to allow you to have a milestone view with planned dates, and then how well we're tracking against those different milestones. So we we start phase one. That's a master. That's because it's a significant event. We started working on phase one.

2101
03:49:09.620 --> 03:49:29.000
Orlando Sequera: Then the the live. What we're saying here with Id number 31 deliver a is that by the beginning of April, by April fourth, we're planning to have completed deliver deliverable a. And then, by the end of April, beginning of May, we're planning to have completely deliverable B.

2102
03:49:29.010 --> 03:49:40.900
Orlando Sequera: That is a significant master. You might be wondering what is the different between a milestone and a project activity. Well, milestones. We use them in our schedules when we create our schedules in

2103
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:49.319
Orlando Sequera: uses them using a project management information software like Microsoft Project, for example, milestones

2104
03:49:49.730 --> 03:49:55.479
Orlando Sequera: do not have any duration. My milestones have a duration of 0

2105
03:49:55.960 --> 03:50:01.729
Orlando Sequera: because they only are used to represent a significant event in the project.

2106
03:50:01.760 --> 03:50:03.220
Orlando Sequera: They they are they.

2107
03:50:03.290 --> 03:50:13.189
Orlando Sequera: That's one of the difference that they have compared to an activity. Another difference is that activities. They do have resources assigned to them.

2108
03:50:13.700 --> 03:50:19.929
Orlando Sequera: and they also have a cost assigned to them. Milestones have 0 duration.

2109
03:50:20.130 --> 03:50:22.659
Orlando Sequera: They do not have any resources assigned to them.

2110
03:50:23.280 --> 03:50:30.009
Orlando Sequera: and they do not have any cost assigned to them. They're only used to represent significant events in your project.

2111
03:50:30.380 --> 03:50:35.770
Orlando Sequera: Another view that we can use to present your schedule is

2112
03:50:35.980 --> 03:50:38.409
Orlando Sequera: what we call the schedule network diagram.

2113
03:50:38.620 --> 03:50:45.950
Orlando Sequera: and that this is just an example. Basically, viewing what we, what we use for the critical path.

2114
03:50:46.120 --> 03:50:57.869
Orlando Sequera: Okay, but I have some good news for you. Soft, my project management software, like Microsoft Project, it will calculate the critical path for you imagine, if you had to do

2115
03:50:57.880 --> 03:51:12.630
Orlando Sequera: to do that manually with 500 700 activities? Right? That'll take some some time. It's not impossible. But it will it's gonna it's gonna be very time consuming. So that's 1 one of the beauties that you have with

2116
03:51:12.640 --> 03:51:19.740
Orlando Sequera: project management. Software but you need to understand what it means. And remember that's what the Pmp. Exam. Is looking for.

2117
03:51:19.900 --> 03:51:28.499
Orlando Sequera: So you understand the definition, the interpretation of the critical path, and they're going to ask you questions on that. What type of questions

2118
03:51:28.730 --> 03:51:42.279
Orlando Sequera: I just mentioned? Briefly, one. But I will then strongly suggest you to start taking practice questions in test prep. That's ha! That's how you're going to get ready for the Pmp. Exam with the practice questions.

2119
03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:45.449
Orlando Sequera: But now we have build the schedule.

2120
03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:49.169
Orlando Sequera: We have calculated the quicker path.

2121
03:51:49.430 --> 03:51:51.869
Orlando Sequera: Can we make it better?

2122
03:51:52.150 --> 03:52:01.470
Orlando Sequera: And this is where some of the questions also. What do I? What what do we do if we are using a

2123
03:52:02.420 --> 03:52:15.689
Orlando Sequera: What do we do to improve this schedule? Right to map out the schedule? What we we start working with resources, we start. We need to start allocating resources to our schedule. Okay.

2124
03:52:15.960 --> 03:52:16.960
Orlando Sequera: And

2125
03:52:17.270 --> 03:52:23.150
Orlando Sequera: when we do that we work and remember, the goal should be. To build a schedule is as

2126
03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:27.120
Orlando Sequera: accurate as possible as realistic as possible. Right? We need

2127
03:52:27.180 --> 03:52:46.879
Orlando Sequera: duration estimates. We added that we build the dependencies. We we're able to link all of our activities. But now we are going to work on resources because those activities are going to be done. I'm going to be done. We need resources to them, not only people, but we need materials when it supplies we need a equipment.

2128
03:52:46.890 --> 03:53:05.959
Orlando Sequera: Okay. So now let's incorporate that and let's see how we can make sure that we're making the best use of those resources. So for that, to make sure that we're making the best, we're being as efficient as possible with the way we're using our resources. We use

2129
03:53:05.970 --> 03:53:07.110
Orlando Sequera: 2 techniques.

2130
03:53:07.630 --> 03:53:10.939
Orlando Sequera: The first one is what we call resource moving.

2131
03:53:12.120 --> 03:53:13.789
Orlando Sequera: and this

2132
03:53:14.330 --> 03:53:15.170
Orlando Sequera: 2

2133
03:53:15.340 --> 03:53:16.580
Orlando Sequera: good, some

2134
03:53:16.770 --> 03:53:18.989
Orlando Sequera: pretty fine resource limits

2135
03:53:19.520 --> 03:53:23.379
Orlando Sequera: in the project activities, so we can then.

2136
03:53:23.530 --> 03:53:26.250
Orlando Sequera: and what we

2137
03:53:26.890 --> 03:53:38.520
Orlando Sequera: much reality as possible, because we're gonna have some limitations. For example, we can build the schedule, and perhaps we said we calculated, for example, that it's going to take us 16 weeks

2138
03:53:38.530 --> 03:53:49.529
Orlando Sequera: to complete the schedule. But when we start looking at those activities we start saying that this is gonna be 16 weeks if we work 60 h a week.

2139
03:53:49.890 --> 03:53:50.799
Orlando Sequera: So

2140
03:53:51.940 --> 03:54:04.939
Orlando Sequera: that's that's not gonna go well. So we gotta make it more realistic. We have to put some a predefined resource limits about the number of hours that we're going to be working per week and limit that

2141
03:54:05.460 --> 03:54:06.640
Orlando Sequera: in them.

2142
03:54:06.680 --> 03:54:12.580
Orlando Sequera: In this case we could be 40 or 45 h depending on what the organization allows.

2143
03:54:12.640 --> 03:54:20.519
Orlando Sequera: So let's assume that they only allow up to 45 h per week. So then that's a that's a way that you can predefine your

2144
03:54:20.660 --> 03:54:33.699
Orlando Sequera: the the resource limits. In that case, that's just an example, right? Just an example. So you are building that realistic scheduled. You're not saying oh, it's going to take a 16 weeks. But if we were 60 h a week they

2145
03:54:33.850 --> 03:54:35.850
Orlando Sequera: First leveling is also

2146
03:54:36.650 --> 03:54:38.080
Orlando Sequera: a

2147
03:54:38.370 --> 03:54:49.159
Orlando Sequera: just in your. That's another way to optimize your schedule from the resource perspective. But in this case you're balancing the demand for resources with the

2148
03:54:49.370 --> 03:54:59.590
Orlando Sequera: the with the availability of resources that you have at the moment. So you don't have perhaps in some weeks you're working a people are working

2149
03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:13.070
Orlando Sequera: if 45 h for them in the next 2 weeks. They're only working 10 h, right? So you want to balance that out. You're based on your resource availability. So it's as even as possible. You want to level that out.

2150
03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:23.960
Orlando Sequera: and for the entire schedule of your project as much as possible, so you are not over working people, and not or working

2151
03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:37.589
Orlando Sequera: not really making the best use of your resources throughout the entire duration of your project. That's what's going to help us to be as efficient as possible with the way you manage your resources in your project.

2152
03:55:38.390 --> 03:55:41.990
Orlando Sequera: That's one way that we can optimize our

2153
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:47.929
Orlando Sequera: schedule. The second is. And this addresses some of the questions that some of you had

2154
03:55:48.860 --> 03:55:49.810
Orlando Sequera: in

2155
03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:53.009
Orlando Sequera: in the Q. And a. Before we went to break.

2156
03:55:53.860 --> 03:55:56.300
Orlando Sequera: What do we do? If

2157
03:55:56.420 --> 03:55:58.320
Orlando Sequera: in the event of

2158
03:55:58.580 --> 03:56:09.530
Orlando Sequera: we need to, we we need to meet some new day constraints. We. We said that it was gonna take a 6 months to complete this project, but all of a sudden

2159
03:56:09.570 --> 03:56:24.760
Orlando Sequera: opera management came back and said, No, we are. We have a we have a hard cost train. Our customers are expecting. We have a construction obligation to complete this product in 4 months. What do I do? So in that situation? Step number one.

2160
03:56:24.860 --> 03:56:39.290
Orlando Sequera: You start with your resources. You want to make sure that you are with smoothing and leveling that you are not over working people, that you're making the best use possible of your resources for your project. That step number one step number 2 is

2161
03:56:39.720 --> 03:56:42.430
Orlando Sequera: schedule compression techniques.

2162
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:49.200
Orlando Sequera: This is also another way to optimize your your schedule to address some of those situations.

2163
03:56:49.880 --> 03:56:51.090
Orlando Sequera: The first

2164
03:56:51.120 --> 03:56:52.060
Orlando Sequera: technique

2165
03:56:52.170 --> 03:56:54.230
Orlando Sequera: is fast tracking.

2166
03:56:55.470 --> 03:56:56.560
Orlando Sequera: Basically

2167
03:56:56.820 --> 03:57:13.339
Orlando Sequera: with fast tracking is performing some activities that you originally said or laid out in your schedule that we're gonna be done sequentially. And let me go back to this to the schedule diagram To illustrate that point, basically a

2168
03:57:13.760 --> 03:57:24.079
Orlando Sequera: an example would be If you look at activity, age and activity F, we're doing them sequentially. If we say that we're going to fast track activities, H. And F

2169
03:57:24.250 --> 03:57:36.670
Orlando Sequera: to compress. The schedule. Basically means that activity. F. And H. Are going to be in parallel, like activities. Bnc: actually, activities. B and C are an example of

2170
03:57:36.680 --> 03:57:51.260
Orlando Sequera: activities that are being done in parallel. So we're gonna fast track. We're gonna do things that normally we will do in parallel. Now, we're gonna do them or sequentially. Now, we're gonna do them in parallel. Okay.

2171
03:57:51.430 --> 03:58:06.859
Orlando Sequera: that has some drawbacks. That is not a silver bullet that has some drawbacks, major considerations. Yes, we can do some activities in parallel, but this might have an impact on the quality of your

2172
03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:07.880
Orlando Sequera: project

2173
03:58:07.960 --> 03:58:12.800
Orlando Sequera: may result in. We were because originally there is a reason why you were doing those activities

2174
03:58:12.880 --> 03:58:20.720
Orlando Sequera: in a sequence sequentially right. So you gotta take that into account, and that might increase risks, and it might increase

2175
03:58:20.780 --> 03:58:26.310
Orlando Sequera: cost because because of possible rework, and it an example of fast tracking

2176
03:58:26.340 --> 03:58:32.650
Orlando Sequera: for those of you that like, i'm gonna go back to sports a f one or nascar

2177
03:58:33.260 --> 03:58:35.000
Orlando Sequera: a pit. Stop right

2178
03:58:36.430 --> 03:58:40.069
Orlando Sequera: you. If you pay attention, the pit. Stop. We have

2179
03:58:40.130 --> 03:58:56.029
Orlando Sequera: groups that are changing the tires, and they're basically doing multiple things, refueling the car, changing the tires. All of that happens at the same time, right? And if you see, because if you did, oh, well, let's change the tires.

2180
03:58:56.040 --> 03:59:00.820
Orlando Sequera: then refuel the card, then that will take forever. And then.

2181
03:59:00.990 --> 03:59:10.399
Orlando Sequera: by the time they're done, the race is over right? So in some cases that's that's an example of fast tracking, but it requires very specialized.

2182
03:59:10.410 --> 03:59:29.910
Orlando Sequera: the crew has to be very, very specialized. They they're train, they they know what they're doing, and it is safe. But can you imagine the average person trying to do everything that happens in a pit? Stop a at the same time a bunch of average people. That would be a disaster. That would be a disaster. I wouldn't even

2183
03:59:29.920 --> 03:59:41.259
Orlando Sequera: want to think about. That Will might drive rework, increase, risk and increase cost that wouldn't one. Those people touching a vehicle. Okay, so. But that's an example of fast tracking.

2184
03:59:41.500 --> 03:59:51.470
Orlando Sequera: It works in some cases, but we it's an option that we have, but it's not always going to be a silver bullet. We gotta take into account the possible impacts, but it is a possibility.

2185
03:59:52.010 --> 03:59:59.800
Orlando Sequera: and we gotta get the team members involved in those discussions. They, the other one is pretty easier to understand is crashing.

2186
04:00:00.690 --> 04:00:19.330
Orlando Sequera: Crashing means it's the classic, Go to that Many people over match and have it. Let's row more bodies at it. Let's add more people. That's what crashing is adding more people to the activities in order to shorten the duration.

2187
04:00:19.470 --> 04:00:32.380
Orlando Sequera: Okay, I'll give you a quick example, let's assume for a minute that we're trying to crash the schedule, and one of the activities is painting. The rooms is taking 6 h to pay in each room

2188
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:36.049
Orlando Sequera: with 2 painters. Okay, list app.

2189
04:00:36.560 --> 04:00:39.990
Orlando Sequera: 2 more painters or let's add 4 more painters

2190
04:00:40.150 --> 04:00:42.330
Orlando Sequera: at the same time. But

2191
04:00:43.900 --> 04:00:45.600
Orlando Sequera: it that's

2192
04:00:46.050 --> 04:00:54.339
Orlando Sequera: the many people tend to think that. Yeah, by adding more people. That's that's going to shorten theuration up to in some cases. Yes.

2193
04:00:54.360 --> 04:00:58.470
Orlando Sequera: in some cases it's going to work. But you're going to take into account all the variables

2194
04:00:58.500 --> 04:01:18.130
Orlando Sequera: when you start having way. Too many people pain in a room. They're gonna to start bumping into each other, and it's actually going to be it. It could be the opposite. It could take longer. Or what about the level of expertise? You might have some experience, painters. It takes 6 h to experience painters, but if you have. If you have 4

2195
04:01:18.140 --> 04:01:22.959
Orlando Sequera: new painters that that are starting their Korean and painting, then

2196
04:01:23.310 --> 04:01:26.110
Orlando Sequera: that it might take 7 h. So

2197
04:01:26.470 --> 04:01:33.040
Orlando Sequera: that's something that we have that that it's not always a silver bullet. In some cases it works, it only works

2198
04:01:33.200 --> 04:01:49.330
Orlando Sequera: for, or we should apply that to activities that are part of the critical path. But it's not a silver bullet, either. Okay, we have that option. It works in some cases, but it's on a case by case. And there, that's what you can use to optimize your schedule in

2199
04:01:49.380 --> 04:02:00.100
Orlando Sequera: some cases. Yes, it's going to be people adding more developers, for example, to develop a software, a functionality. It works in some cases, but it's on a case

2200
04:02:00.220 --> 04:02:04.020
Orlando Sequera: case. scenario, right? It's not a silver bullet.

2201
04:02:04.600 --> 04:02:05.369
Orlando Sequera: all right.

2202
04:02:07.680 --> 04:02:21.710
Orlando Sequera: And after we have that in place, and we optimize our schedule from the resource perspective. We build our schedule and we optimize our schedule from using schedule compression techniques. We have

2203
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:28.869
Orlando Sequera: finally being able to put together our schedule, and we can come up with our

2204
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:32.079
Orlando Sequera: and with our

2205
04:02:32.310 --> 04:02:35.840
Orlando Sequera: scheduled baseline, which is the approved

2206
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:49.349
Orlando Sequera: version of the schedule that is only going to change through a change control process and pay attention that we're talking here about predictive pay attention to that. We're talking about predictive.

2207
04:02:49.420 --> 04:03:02.349
Orlando Sequera: This baseline is only going to change through a change controlled process the same way that we did with the scope baseline. So this is the second baseline that we have for our project.

2208
04:03:02.470 --> 04:03:03.260
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2209
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:10.849
Orlando Sequera: So at ideally you should come. This is going to help you to complete the scheduled prime activities.

2210
04:03:10.920 --> 04:03:16.459
Orlando Sequera: And you should add this the baseline to your overall project management plan.

2211
04:03:17.330 --> 04:03:21.790
Orlando Sequera: Okay? And then it's going to help you to compare your actual progress.

2212
04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:25.890
Orlando Sequera: to which is what we call plan values

2213
04:03:25.930 --> 04:03:27.260
Orlando Sequera: to your

2214
04:03:27.310 --> 04:03:29.240
Orlando Sequera: A, to what we plan for

2215
04:03:29.400 --> 04:03:32.030
Orlando Sequera: that. That plan is the scheduled baseline.

2216
04:03:32.200 --> 04:03:37.990
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and we only change it through the formal change control process

2217
04:03:38.410 --> 04:03:40.570
Orlando Sequera: we do with this called baseline.

2218
04:03:48.230 --> 04:03:53.450
Orlando Sequera: and then, finally, we have something that we call special intervals. We have to also

2219
04:03:53.530 --> 04:03:54.400
Orlando Sequera: a

2220
04:03:55.000 --> 04:03:57.420
Orlando Sequera: take those into account in your planning.

2221
04:03:57.600 --> 04:03:59.520
Orlando Sequera: in in your planning efforts.

2222
04:03:59.910 --> 04:04:02.929
Orlando Sequera: If, for example, blackout times.

2223
04:04:03.780 --> 04:04:13.080
Orlando Sequera: when you're working on something and you want to suspend changes pencils down. That's what we call a blackout time, you that's also known as a special interval

2224
04:04:13.120 --> 04:04:30.059
Orlando Sequera: A. At the end of your project when you're transitioning your project to production. You have to schedule for a go life that happens at the end of your project, and this has to be negotiated with your stakeholders.

2225
04:04:30.120 --> 04:04:40.769
Orlando Sequera: A, and has to be coordinated with your stakeholders. So you also have some special in the you have to take them. Take this into account in order to

2226
04:04:40.810 --> 04:04:43.050
Orlando Sequera: for your schedule planning purposes

2227
04:04:43.240 --> 04:04:43.850
as well.

2228
04:04:44.230 --> 04:04:44.990
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2229
04:04:46.540 --> 04:04:48.640
Orlando Sequera: What are the guidelines for

2230
04:04:48.990 --> 04:04:53.599
Orlando Sequera: schedule management when it comes to an agile approach that we are following

2231
04:04:54.580 --> 04:04:56.010
Orlando Sequera: A.

2232
04:04:57.590 --> 04:05:05.430
Orlando Sequera: Even though, as I mentioned before, in agile, we usually have ceilings. We might have a final completion, date already established.

2233
04:05:05.450 --> 04:05:11.999
Orlando Sequera: Remember the major projects. The scope is not fixed. We don't have a baseline for the scope.

2234
04:05:12.140 --> 04:05:14.810
Orlando Sequera: The scope is changing. We know that going in

2235
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:22.100
Orlando Sequera: to the number of changes. That's why we decided to go with this approach. So a even though we might have

2236
04:05:22.110 --> 04:05:38.700
Orlando Sequera: an actual completion day target date 6 months for now or a year from now or 3 months from now we Still, this is a the planning. The scheduled planning is going to be aligned with the priorities that are set by the business

2237
04:05:38.720 --> 04:05:50.799
Orlando Sequera: in the following: the guidelines a of the product owner, the representative. So it really depends on the team composition and the life cycle that we choose.

2238
04:05:51.500 --> 04:05:55.220
Orlando Sequera: The project team is going to coordinate this work

2239
04:05:55.460 --> 04:06:01.900
Orlando Sequera: with the product owner, because the fork owner is the steward of the scope of an adaptive project.

2240
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:10.039
Orlando Sequera: and they're going to develop the roadmap to show their release of functionality at certain specific timeframes.

2241
04:06:10.180 --> 04:06:27.560
Orlando Sequera: I have seen many organizations that they have a monthly release some of the organizations they do a quarterly release. It changes from organization to organization, but it's usually more multiple iterations of sprint that get released at the same time

2242
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:34.290
Orlando Sequera: A. They choose an approach. They can do it, using a time box approach scheduling.

2243
04:06:34.350 --> 04:06:40.410
Orlando Sequera: Last I mentioned before every month or every quarter, for example, or they can do it on demand

2244
04:06:40.730 --> 04:06:56.299
Orlando Sequera: as needed, meaning that whenever it makes sense there's not a cadence, and necessarily necessarily a cadence. This more they release functionality whenever is needed whenever it makes sense. That's also another way. You don't need to have a regular cadence for that

2245
04:06:56.310 --> 04:07:15.859
Orlando Sequera: and the project team, as we have said, they select activities that will be delivered within the iteration. They're the ones that are going to decide what's going to be built in a particular iteration, and the team is going to be producing incrementally, functionally over the

2246
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:16.800
Orlando Sequera: actual

2247
04:07:17.440 --> 04:07:32.009
Orlando Sequera: life cycle of the project one iteration of time. They're going to be building functionally and incrementally right. Not all the functionality One single sprint, because it's only 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks. They're going to be building incrementally.

2248
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:36.869
Orlando Sequera: I feel the approaches.

2249
04:07:37.360 --> 04:07:38.580
Orlando Sequera: Comparing

2250
04:07:38.650 --> 04:07:45.340
Orlando Sequera: the on demand approach, which is lean, lean, based compared to time. Box is that

2251
04:07:45.400 --> 04:07:47.969
Orlando Sequera: and we're following a on demand approach.

2252
04:07:48.890 --> 04:07:54.809
Orlando Sequera: we allow individual requests to be addressed because we're going to release whenever it makes sense.

2253
04:07:54.960 --> 04:08:02.549
Orlando Sequera: It levels out the work of the team members, and this works better when activities are actually divided equally

2254
04:08:04.090 --> 04:08:08.879
Orlando Sequera: compared to a time box or iterative approach following a cadence.

2255
04:08:09.690 --> 04:08:20.720
Orlando Sequera: These uses progressive elaboration to schedule activities, and they have a specific work interval, for example, to every 2 weeks, and it allows changes at any time during the project.

2256
04:08:22.430 --> 04:08:25.640
Orlando Sequera: The goal. If we're following a an on demand approach.

2257
04:08:25.770 --> 04:08:33.609
Orlando Sequera: we should prioritize the request to start the sequence, and then sequence of stores individually through completion, through completion.

2258
04:08:33.640 --> 04:08:43.770
Orlando Sequera: The team pulls the work from the queue whenever they are available to work on those sign names, and it's a think of it! Whenever you see Cameron or Lean based.

2259
04:08:43.840 --> 04:09:01.419
Orlando Sequera: think of a conveyor belt. That work is constant, the workflow is constant, and the team members are picking up pieces of work to work on whenever they have availability. Think of a manufacturing setting in a in a car production facility like for DM. Or Toyota, for example.

2260
04:09:01.430 --> 04:09:12.970
Orlando Sequera: So the team members pull work from the queue whenever they are, they have capacity, which is, which means, whenever they are available. And these provides incremental business value.

2261
04:09:13.560 --> 04:09:15.689
Orlando Sequera: If we're following a time box, approach

2262
04:09:16.200 --> 04:09:17.220
Orlando Sequera: they

2263
04:09:17.580 --> 04:09:20.320
Orlando Sequera: the with the 5 requirements with user stories.

2264
04:09:20.720 --> 04:09:26.620
Orlando Sequera: as we said, that's how we write requirements in Agile. And then we're going to prioritize these user stories.

2265
04:09:26.680 --> 04:09:34.280
Orlando Sequera: working with the product owner, and we select the work based on the priorities wherever it is, at the top of the pro backlock.

2266
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:35.460
Orlando Sequera: and

2267
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:46.679
Orlando Sequera: we're going to be able to deliver business value early, because we are developing the actual priorities. The actual high value items first, and we're building in increments

2268
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:49.399
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more

2269
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:51.420
Orlando Sequera: about.

2270
04:09:51.970 --> 04:09:54.029
Orlando Sequera: They adaptive planning view.

2271
04:09:54.940 --> 04:10:08.560
Orlando Sequera: I've released, scheduled, as I was mentioned before you should last 3 to 6 months, and you in a release. You're going to really. You're going to be able to release the functionality that was built in multiple iterations. This is a good

2272
04:10:08.600 --> 04:10:21.610
Orlando Sequera: overview, was what I was mentioning before you're going to be able to release Mo: a lot of functionality that was completed in multiple iterations. You group that, and then your release. That is quarterly.

2273
04:10:22.410 --> 04:10:23.800
Orlando Sequera: In some cases

2274
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:26.120
Orlando Sequera: it it could be every 6 months.

2275
04:10:26.250 --> 04:10:33.080
Orlando Sequera: whatever the organization decides, but they try to be strategic. For example, they have been able to determine that

2276
04:10:33.100 --> 04:10:38.250
Orlando Sequera: the user the users we're working in a

2277
04:10:39.150 --> 04:10:41.969
Orlando Sequera: Our project is to enhance

2278
04:10:42.730 --> 04:10:45.190
Orlando Sequera: messaging mobile app right?

2279
04:10:45.210 --> 04:10:47.659
Orlando Sequera: And we have been able to determine

2280
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:51.810
Orlando Sequera: that our customer preferences are actually are asking for security.

2281
04:10:52.240 --> 04:11:09.060
Orlando Sequera: They need. They want to see more security features in Whatsapp. So what happens is that all this iterations, any features, related any function I relate to security. It's gonna it's gonna become more important. It's gonna be at the top of the product backlog, and that's what the teams.

2282
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:20.400
Orlando Sequera: The teams are gonna most likely be developing in the next few iterations. Whenever the business or the customers see that we have enough functionality to release

2283
04:11:21.150 --> 04:11:22.390
Orlando Sequera: it to

2284
04:11:23.100 --> 04:11:28.229
Orlando Sequera: to release into production that covers a security. That's when this.

2285
04:11:28.520 --> 04:11:39.709
Orlando Sequera: But this group of iterations are going to be released together, all that functionality, and that's how we're going to be able to a address. Those customer preferences. That's pretty much

2286
04:11:39.740 --> 04:11:50.339
Orlando Sequera: in a nutshell. How it works, and there's some terminology here. Velocity is, how quickly the team can produce a functionality Complete those

2287
04:11:50.360 --> 04:11:59.030
Orlando Sequera: user stories. That's what we mean by velocity. How quickly the team can produce a velocity. We are going to take a break

2288
04:11:59.500 --> 04:12:07.639
Orlando Sequera: right now when we come back. The addressing a questions that we have in the Q. A. So we continue

2289
04:12:08.320 --> 04:12:13.670
Orlando Sequera: with a company. Okay. So we're gonna take our 10 min break and we will be right back.

2290
04:12:13.860 --> 04:12:15.380
Orlando Sequera: Thank you very much. Everyone.

2291
04:12:23.280 --> 04:12:28.209
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna take a few minutes to address some of the questions in the Q. A.

2292
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:47.079
Orlando Sequera: And remember, please vote on the questions in the Q. A. So I i'm going to start by the ones I have the most votes.

2293
04:12:47.460 --> 04:12:48.250
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

2294
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:59.449
And

2295
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:03.710
Orlando Sequera: a question here, I think.

2296
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:16.050
Orlando Sequera: This is a probably about the application for requirements where you work in projects. We're not always leading projects. It's about leading projects. A. That is the experience that you need to have.

2297
04:13:16.320 --> 04:13:18.819
Orlando Sequera: But what's your videos we have

2298
04:13:18.970 --> 04:13:23.220
Orlando Sequera: in the resources. We have videos of the app about the application that can help you.

2299
04:13:24.000 --> 04:13:26.600
Orlando Sequera: to understand

2300
04:13:26.850 --> 04:13:29.440
Orlando Sequera: that in a little bit more detail.

2301
04:13:30.880 --> 04:13:31.760
Okay.

2302
04:13:34.930 --> 04:13:35.490
Hmm.

2303
04:13:39.720 --> 04:13:40.570
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2304
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:47.149
Orlando Sequera: for I see some questions about what is forward, past and backward past

2305
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:56.100
Orlando Sequera: in the exam. In the current version of the exam, in the current version of the exam that start in 2,021.

2306
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:59.619
Orlando Sequera: You do not need

2307
04:13:59.820 --> 04:14:00.660
Orlando Sequera: to.

2308
04:14:00.690 --> 04:14:04.710
Orlando Sequera: You're not going to have questions that are going to ask you to calculate the critical

2309
04:14:04.940 --> 04:14:07.220
Orlando Sequera: path of a project like

2310
04:14:08.490 --> 04:14:10.840
Orlando Sequera: like it like it was before

2311
04:14:10.970 --> 04:14:14.380
Orlando Sequera: when I took it many years ago. That was the case.

2312
04:14:14.450 --> 04:14:17.930
Orlando Sequera: but that's no longer the case with this new version of the Exempt.

2313
04:14:18.800 --> 04:14:21.139
Orlando Sequera: A. The actual

2314
04:14:21.470 --> 04:14:32.349
Orlando Sequera: forward past and backward paths are going to allow you to calculate the early start and the early finish, and the late start, and the late finished the early start in the early finish. You can you use the

2315
04:14:32.420 --> 04:14:34.000
Orlando Sequera: the forward fast

2316
04:14:34.090 --> 04:14:38.479
Orlando Sequera: and to calculate the late start of the late finish. You use the backward pass.

2317
04:14:38.770 --> 04:14:43.979
Orlando Sequera: and that's how you ultimately can calculate the float of your

2318
04:14:44.800 --> 04:14:46.679
Orlando Sequera: activities. Okay.

2319
04:14:46.730 --> 04:14:52.890
Orlando Sequera: But what you need to know about the critical path for the exam is

2320
04:14:53.190 --> 04:14:56.599
Orlando Sequera: the interpretation, the definition? What does it mean?

2321
04:14:56.610 --> 04:15:14.640
Orlando Sequera: It? It is the longest path, meaning that is the shortest time that it's gonna take us to complete the project. You need to know the definition. They the interpretation really well. And you also need to know what happens. If an activity that is part of the critical path

2322
04:15:14.690 --> 04:15:17.279
Orlando Sequera: is delayed, what happens?

2323
04:15:17.400 --> 04:15:19.690
Orlando Sequera: You can. You can delay those activities.

2324
04:15:19.760 --> 04:15:20.810
Orlando Sequera: and

2325
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:30.540
Orlando Sequera: because if they get delayed, your entire project gets delayed. That's what you have to safeguard as a project manager. Make sure that you understand

2326
04:15:30.600 --> 04:15:38.109
Orlando Sequera: what the critical path is the definition? The questions are going to be about interpretation, critical thinking.

2327
04:15:39.250 --> 04:15:46.910
Orlando Sequera: Okay, Pmi is not looking for. to it's not. It's not really looking for

2328
04:15:46.920 --> 04:16:01.549
Orlando Sequera: to be able to determine whether you know how to perform a back or pass, or a forward pass. That's not what they're looking for, what they're looking for is to make sure that you understand what it is and what your role is when it comes to the critical path.

2329
04:16:01.580 --> 04:16:15.719
Orlando Sequera: What do you have to do when it to to protect activities that are part of the curriculum path, using scheduled compression techniques, fast tracking, and also resource of a fast tracking and crashing.

2330
04:16:15.730 --> 04:16:22.300
Orlando Sequera: and also using a from the resource perspective resource of some optimization techniques

2331
04:16:22.400 --> 04:16:37.609
Orlando Sequera: like resource, leveling and resource moving. Okay, that's what they're looking for. To make sure that you can apply those tools and techniques to your project schedule. You're send. There. Are they? Are scenario.

2332
04:16:38.650 --> 04:16:39.560
Orlando Sequera: a

2333
04:16:39.660 --> 04:16:46.030
Orlando Sequera: questions, and you're going to have it's about problem solving. I guess the best way to describe the Pmp. Exam. Questions.

2334
04:16:46.100 --> 04:16:49.200
Orlando Sequera: They are of our problem installments. Your

2335
04:16:49.240 --> 04:16:55.549
Orlando Sequera: a mindset should be. I'm going to go to that exam to solve a 180 different problems.

2336
04:16:55.570 --> 04:16:56.360
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2337
04:16:57.000 --> 04:16:58.330
Orlando Sequera: A.

2338
04:16:59.130 --> 04:17:01.350
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Going to continue with the questions.

2339
04:17:18.430 --> 04:17:22.830
Orlando Sequera: Can you elaborate on the difference between active iteration and effort.

2340
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:25.380
Orlando Sequera: and for his express. As our things.

2341
04:17:25.770 --> 04:17:26.660
The

2342
04:17:26.930 --> 04:17:37.549
Orlando Sequera: duration is expressed the same way. They they come to be the same. Look at it as the same. It's the duration. How long it's going to take you to complete the activity, and you will be a

2343
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:52.400
Orlando Sequera: that's that's what you. That's the important aspect you how long it's going to take when you consideration. How long is it going to take you to complete that activity? Try to make it as as clear as possible. Not make it come, not make it convoluted. So look at the duration aspect.

2344
04:17:52.440 --> 04:17:53.060
Okay.

2345
04:17:53.240 --> 04:17:55.650
Orlando Sequera: for the purposes of the exempt.

2346
04:18:03.080 --> 04:18:04.460
Orlando Sequera: That was, Answer

2347
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:07.280
Orlando Sequera: another question in the chat.

2348
04:18:07.340 --> 04:18:11.229
Orlando Sequera: How would you about? I'm: Sorry. Not in the in the Q. And a.

2349
04:18:11.250 --> 04:18:14.840
Orlando Sequera: How would you advice? Translated military project planning.

2350
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:17.449
Orlando Sequera: actually doing the product to break experience

2351
04:18:17.760 --> 04:18:19.790
Orlando Sequera: that some great

2352
04:18:20.010 --> 04:18:21.100
Orlando Sequera: question

2353
04:18:21.190 --> 04:18:24.209
Orlando Sequera: I will recommend you to leverage.

2354
04:18:25.050 --> 04:18:42.189
Orlando Sequera: Not gonna venture I I was not in the military, so i'm not gonna venture to do that. But I am sure that in your organizations, whether you're coming from on on more to opportunity or a. There's another organization that also supports Professionals like you.

2355
04:18:42.560 --> 04:18:54.340
Orlando Sequera: They are. They have resources that can help you with that to translate your military planning experience to your midterm experience to planning experience. It's a great transition. So

2356
04:18:54.390 --> 04:18:59.169
Orlando Sequera: I would recommend you to look for those resources in your respective organization.

2357
04:18:59.710 --> 04:19:01.830
Orlando Sequera: what other questions.

2358
04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:31.530
Okay, I

2359
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:33.270
trying

2360
04:19:41.680 --> 04:19:43.430
Orlando Sequera: there is a question.

2361
04:19:43.560 --> 04:19:50.849
Orlando Sequera: Is the velocity usually share outside the product team? Yes, you can share that information with our stakeholders.

2362
04:19:50.920 --> 04:19:56.909
Orlando Sequera: But velocity is something is. Remember how quickly project teams are

2363
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:59.789
Orlando Sequera: working or producing a

2364
04:20:00.580 --> 04:20:03.790
Orlando Sequera: user stories or features. Put

2365
04:20:04.270 --> 04:20:07.180
Orlando Sequera: One thing that we have to keep in mind is that

2366
04:20:07.530 --> 04:20:11.020
Orlando Sequera: velocity. It starts with the estimation.

2367
04:20:11.130 --> 04:20:11.900
We

2368
04:20:12.190 --> 04:20:20.079
Orlando Sequera: do. Different teams have different velocities, and we shouldn't. We should try to not.

2369
04:20:20.190 --> 04:20:22.590
Orlando Sequera: Some things might have a a

2370
04:20:22.730 --> 04:20:33.809
Orlando Sequera: a lower velocity compared to other teams, but they might be dealing with higher complexity items. So it's not always apples to apples. Okay, so yes, that can be sure outside the team, but

2371
04:20:34.180 --> 04:20:54.080
Orlando Sequera: with that a constraint, that velocity for it it shouldn't be. Look! Look equally across the board. It changes from team to team because they're working in with different levels and different degrees of complexity, and also their their skill set level is also different. So with that caveat I would say

2372
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:56.850
Orlando Sequera: another question.

2373
04:21:02.410 --> 04:21:08.949
Orlando Sequera: think this is a question for the application requirements? What if you work on projects? We're not always leading projects for some of our leading projects.

2374
04:21:08.980 --> 04:21:11.610
Orlando Sequera: I recommend to.

2375
04:21:12.390 --> 04:21:16.240
Orlando Sequera: We have some resources that can help you with the application as well.

2376
04:21:22.880 --> 04:21:25.660
Orlando Sequera: Another question do the

2377
04:21:26.100 --> 04:21:37.619
Orlando Sequera: the predecessor do the precedent set for predecessors and successors have to be 100% accurate for the critical path to be right. Well, you're estimating that duration

2378
04:21:37.920 --> 04:21:49.310
Orlando Sequera: right? So that duration is an estimate. It's an approximation, but that's the best that you have. So you just go with that. No, nothing is going to be 100 right. This is based on

2379
04:21:49.500 --> 04:22:03.710
Orlando Sequera: estimates. Okay, you know, on approximation. But you need to have an idea about the critical path. How long it's going to take you to complete your project, because that's one question that your stakeholders are going to ask you how long it's going to take you to complete my project.

2380
04:22:03.720 --> 04:22:12.630
Orlando Sequera: That's one. They might not know anything of a project management, but they're going to ask you the question: how is it going to take us to? Is it going to take your team to complete the project and the answer.

2381
04:22:12.920 --> 04:22:14.820
Orlando Sequera: It's going to come from that critical path.

2382
04:22:17.980 --> 04:22:19.199
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2383
04:22:23.230 --> 04:22:29.919
Orlando Sequera: what is the actual calculation that you are using for critical path, i'm. Adding the duration of the different paths

2384
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:36.170
Orlando Sequera: and the longest duration that is the critical path, the longest path that is the critical path.

2385
04:22:41.890 --> 04:22:44.480
Orlando Sequera: So activity F. Has one day flow

2386
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:55.229
Orlando Sequera: erez agmoni. If he has a float, that means that it's not part of the creek or path. I will have to go back and check. But that might be the case. You subtract the late finish from the late start. 1, 2,

2387
04:22:55.360 --> 04:22:56.539
Orlando Sequera: and that's how

2388
04:22:57.060 --> 04:22:57.830
Orlando Sequera: you know

2389
04:23:10.340 --> 04:23:12.929
Orlando Sequera: usually there's a question

2390
04:23:13.090 --> 04:23:18.719
Orlando Sequera: slide 68. Why is there a one under the start box and the diagram and it's counted somewhere in the quicker path?

2391
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:25.680
Orlando Sequera: No, No, it's not counted this just to indicate the start after that of the

2392
04:23:26.740 --> 04:23:28.869
Orlando Sequera: the start of the network diagram.

2393
04:23:40.830 --> 04:23:43.900
Orlando Sequera: Another question.

2394
04:23:48.770 --> 04:23:50.289
Orlando Sequera: They will drag that

2395
04:23:52.850 --> 04:23:56.980
Orlando Sequera: that flexibility is the cushion for unknown hindrances.

2396
04:23:57.350 --> 04:23:58.210
Orlando Sequera: Nope.

2397
04:23:58.440 --> 04:24:07.349
Orlando Sequera: that's what we call reserves. This is only how much time can an activity be delayed? That's what the float is. But it's not

2398
04:24:07.760 --> 04:24:09.940
Orlando Sequera: a buffer. It is.

2399
04:24:10.680 --> 04:24:12.980
Orlando Sequera: We're going to talk about reserves later.

2400
04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:16.369
Orlando Sequera: That will be that cushion. So the the

2401
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:26.790
Orlando Sequera: if lake star might necessarily start. It's not equal to late finish, minus

2402
04:24:27.280 --> 04:24:29.709
Orlando Sequera: or late. Finish my late start.

2403
04:24:30.910 --> 04:24:35.040
Orlando Sequera: If it's not equal, you are in trouble. You're not doing something right.

2404
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.660
Okay.

2405
04:24:37.470 --> 04:24:39.160
Orlando Sequera: you're not doing something right.

2406
04:24:45.880 --> 04:24:46.440
me

2407
04:24:49.310 --> 04:24:52.690
Orlando Sequera: right. I think we are getting.

2408
04:24:55.270 --> 04:25:04.569
Orlando Sequera: If another question, if the flow is calculated, calculate it's different from start to end, you go with the largest as long as number they have to match in both.

2409
04:25:04.820 --> 04:25:05.720
Orlando Sequera: And

2410
04:25:05.770 --> 04:25:11.349
Orlando Sequera: and otherwise you're doing something wrong. When you calculate the forward pass or the

2411
04:25:11.760 --> 04:25:12.980
Orlando Sequera: backward path.

2412
04:25:13.320 --> 04:25:15.839
Orlando Sequera: But again, that is not.

2413
04:25:15.900 --> 04:25:27.549
Orlando Sequera: And the type of question that you're gonna get in the Pmp. Exam about the critical path. But if you want to do a deeper dive, you can check PIN box, 6 edition, and it will give you

2414
04:25:27.580 --> 04:25:39.760
Orlando Sequera: a deeper dive. And we also have in precipio videos about the curriculum path that can walk you through that process in more detail. If you're interested in knowing a little bit more. Okay.

2415
04:25:45.550 --> 04:25:55.539
Orlando Sequera: Another question that do research, compression, or optimization requires documentation or approval. Yes, they require approval Absolutely, absolutely.

2416
04:25:56.150 --> 04:26:01.989
Orlando Sequera: But you're doing this usually as a request from your a from the stakeholders.

2417
04:26:13.600 --> 04:26:16.659
Orlando Sequera: Okay, and we're going to continue with

2418
04:26:24.940 --> 04:26:26.990
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna continue with the content. Right?

2419
04:26:36.010 --> 04:26:44.519
Orlando Sequera: Another question. Do parallel activities always have to be on the same exact timetable in terms of metrics, indicating Mount on accomplishment.

2420
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:49.180
Orlando Sequera: If their parallel meaning it means that you're going to be doing them at the same time.

2421
04:26:50.490 --> 04:26:51.270
Okay.

2422
04:26:58.850 --> 04:27:05.880
Orlando Sequera: Another question, how does that go? Life a special interval? You get a coordinate that before you transition to production. Otherwise

2423
04:27:06.300 --> 04:27:11.020
Orlando Sequera: that's going to be a disaster. You're going to coordinate that. And that's a special interval.

2424
04:27:11.220 --> 04:27:14.419
Orlando Sequera: because you need coordination before you transition

2425
04:27:14.490 --> 04:27:18.240
Orlando Sequera: what you're building in your project to a live environment.

2426
04:27:22.660 --> 04:27:26.189
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so let's go ahead and continue with the content

2427
04:27:31.690 --> 04:27:34.180
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to working with features.

2428
04:27:35.250 --> 04:27:37.689
Orlando Sequera: Scheduling is gonna help you to

2429
04:27:38.390 --> 04:27:40.889
Orlando Sequera: align the way we're building features.

2430
04:27:41.180 --> 04:27:42.449
Orlando Sequera: If you

2431
04:27:43.680 --> 04:27:54.799
Orlando Sequera: it's gonna help you to make sure that your it, the way you're building the features is so is is a coordinated in the most efficient way. So that's important to keep in mind.

2432
04:27:54.980 --> 04:28:01.220
Orlando Sequera: and the high level estimate in the feature shows when the blocks functionality can be released

2433
04:28:01.680 --> 04:28:07.270
Orlando Sequera: to the business and end users, and that's where we use that

2434
04:28:09.290 --> 04:28:15.819
Orlando Sequera: agile release. Planning. With story mapping, we sequence we a group user stories

2435
04:28:15.840 --> 04:28:21.780
Orlando Sequera: to make sure that we deliver what needs to be delivered at the right time. Okay.

2436
04:28:22.230 --> 04:28:35.510
Orlando Sequera: a story map is helpful when starting to look at the stories that pertain to our release that allows the features to be sequenced in the most efficient way possible, so that the user stories that

2437
04:28:35.580 --> 04:28:37.510
Orlando Sequera: pertain to those

2438
04:28:38.340 --> 04:28:42.190
Orlando Sequera: it features our associated and prioritized

2439
04:28:42.390 --> 04:28:44.599
Orlando Sequera: and they are released first.

2440
04:28:44.910 --> 04:28:54.260
Orlando Sequera: the determination of which user stories are addressed in it. Iteration, then, considers not just the priority and value of individual stories, but the sequence

2441
04:28:54.530 --> 04:28:59.150
Orlando Sequera: and priority identified in the map. So it's a way to group

2442
04:28:59.270 --> 04:29:02.070
Orlando Sequera: features right by user stories.

2443
04:29:02.230 --> 04:29:08.510
Orlando Sequera: so to make sure that what we release is aligned with the priorities that we have

2444
04:29:08.670 --> 04:29:10.389
Orlando Sequera: from the business

2445
04:29:15.060 --> 04:29:28.519
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to agile one thing that it is really important to keep in mind when it comes to agile. The way we do estimation is a little bit different. We do not estimate duration.

2446
04:29:28.990 --> 04:29:45.929
Orlando Sequera: We. We have to estimate the effort associated with this with the development of these features, and by that I mean with developing the user stories that are in the backlog. Okay, we do estimation in agile in a different way

2447
04:29:48.770 --> 04:29:58.860
Orlando Sequera: we have. We have. We have 3 techniques that we can use to estimate the or the effort. One is

2448
04:29:59.620 --> 04:30:03.300
Orlando Sequera: what is called t-shirt sizing? That's relative.

2449
04:30:03.680 --> 04:30:10.329
Orlando Sequera: Hmm, sizing. And it's basically using a t-shirt sizes for

2450
04:30:10.500 --> 04:30:22.700
Orlando Sequera: the level of effort associated with completing or developing a user story, a requirement right? So For example, if we're talking about the software for the accounting department.

2451
04:30:23.620 --> 04:30:34.419
Orlando Sequera: the monthly sales report, or the accounts payable accounts, receivable report. That is a major endeavor. I'm going to venture. That is an extra large.

2452
04:30:34.450 --> 04:30:39.589
Orlando Sequera: possibly an extra extra large size compared to

2453
04:30:39.850 --> 04:30:48.310
Orlando Sequera: a being able to add new users to the application right? If the user story might be something like this

2454
04:30:48.620 --> 04:30:59.930
Orlando Sequera: some administrator I would like, I would like to be able to add the users to the application. So all the users can start working with the accounting software.

2455
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:04.799
Orlando Sequera: That's an example of the user story. That is, Pro: that's very standard functionality.

2456
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:16.269
Orlando Sequera: 3 in a new account in an application. I'm going to venture to say that that's possibly a small or even an extra small a user story. That's how the estimation is going to be done.

2457
04:31:16.500 --> 04:31:20.189
Orlando Sequera: One thing that is important to keep in mind in agile.

2458
04:31:20.530 --> 04:31:36.879
Orlando Sequera: If we're following an adaptive approach, the estimation is done strictly a 100. By the people doing the work, and by that I mean the project team members. It's not done by the pro manager. It's done by the per owner. It's done by the stakeholders. It's not done by

2459
04:31:37.310 --> 04:31:42.580
Orlando Sequera: this chrome master is done by the people doing the work. The team members okay.

2460
04:31:43.260 --> 04:31:45.510
Orlando Sequera: in predictive Ideally.

2461
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:51.690
Orlando Sequera: the estimates should come from the people doing the work, put in agile interactive. That's a must.

2462
04:31:51.780 --> 04:31:55.620
Orlando Sequera: It comes a 100 from the people doing the work.

2463
04:31:55.820 --> 04:32:03.910
Orlando Sequera: That's one way of doing the estimation. Another way is very common is using what we call user story points.

2464
04:32:04.060 --> 04:32:09.870
Orlando Sequera: That is, basically using a series of numbers based on the Fibonacci sequence.

2465
04:32:10.110 --> 04:32:11.020
Orlando Sequera: and

2466
04:32:12.110 --> 04:32:18.380
Orlando Sequera: the principle behind it is very simple. The more points, the more complex the functionality is.

2467
04:32:18.510 --> 04:32:30.779
Orlando Sequera: So. They use a, for example, at one pointer that the user story of adding a new account to the accounting software that's probably 1 one pointer or 3 points.

2468
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:34.260
Orlando Sequera: Compare to the user story of

2469
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:41.899
Orlando Sequera: being able to generate that monthly sales report. That's a major endeavor. That's probably a 21 pointer

2470
04:32:41.970 --> 04:32:51.740
Orlando Sequera: just to give an idea. So the more points the more complex. That's the whole idea, the whole principle behind using

2471
04:32:51.780 --> 04:32:54.980
Orlando Sequera: user story points. It takes away that

2472
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:58.430
Orlando Sequera: a a motion of duration.

2473
04:32:58.680 --> 04:33:09.660
Orlando Sequera: and this is just looking at complexity, just looking at complexity. And then the estimation is done. Using something that we see here using planning poker

2474
04:33:10.480 --> 04:33:19.179
Orlando Sequera: in which your the your a project team members. They get a take of cards and then

2475
04:33:19.680 --> 04:33:27.600
Orlando Sequera: a facilitator. Normally the scrum master reads out loud the user story, and based on that on the kind of 3 they

2476
04:33:28.009 --> 04:33:43.859
Orlando Sequera: pro the project team members can estimate the duration okay, and they can vote. And ideally, the goal is to reach consensus on the estimates. So that's one way to perform estimation in agile projects. But it is about

2477
04:33:44.360 --> 04:33:52.659
Orlando Sequera: effort, not about time, because we're working with complexity. We're working. We need

2478
04:33:53.220 --> 04:34:11.740
Orlando Sequera: We need to take away that emotion of saying that some something is going to last 4 h or 8 h. We're dealing with a lot of complexity going in. We know that. So for that reason the recommendation is in adaptive to use this type of estimate techniques using a

2479
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:14.819
Orlando Sequera: user story points or using relative sicing.

2480
04:34:14.840 --> 04:34:17.109
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that's the recommendation.

2481
04:34:17.880 --> 04:34:18.930
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2482
04:34:19.960 --> 04:34:22.719
Orlando Sequera: A couple of aspects that are part of

2483
04:34:25.390 --> 04:34:26.470
Orlando Sequera: agile.

2484
04:34:26.800 --> 04:34:29.289
Orlando Sequera: The definition of ready definition of tone.

2485
04:34:31.580 --> 04:34:40.139
Orlando Sequera: The team needs to know when they can be ready to do the work. Okay, but they also need to know when they work. It's going to be considered

2486
04:34:40.509 --> 04:34:41.340
Orlando Sequera: done.

2487
04:34:41.820 --> 04:34:48.049
Orlando Sequera: A. This is a variance. This is a variant of acceptance criteria. The definition of ready

2488
04:34:48.560 --> 04:34:57.910
Orlando Sequera: is is basically going to name what needs to be in place for the team to begin the work with some assurance that the team

2489
04:34:57.990 --> 04:35:00.920
Orlando Sequera: that they work can be completed by the team.

2490
04:35:01.529 --> 04:35:02.260
Orlando Sequera: These

2491
04:35:02.820 --> 04:35:10.170
Orlando Sequera: has a dependency on the environment's complexity and lessons learned from previous print or iterations.

2492
04:35:10.619 --> 04:35:18.390
Orlando Sequera: and normally they use checklist to communicate and collaborate with stakeholders about readiness for work or progress.

2493
04:35:18.740 --> 04:35:20.390
Orlando Sequera: Definition of tone.

2494
04:35:20.619 --> 04:35:22.719
Orlando Sequera: It's a little bit different. It's about

2495
04:35:22.759 --> 04:35:24.240
Orlando Sequera: the desired.

2496
04:35:24.720 --> 04:35:26.200
Orlando Sequera: They They

2497
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:37.189
Orlando Sequera: completion that were the the completion of the items that we're trying to produce. That's what we mean by definition of Don. It's a check. It's a checklist. Basically.

2498
04:35:37.450 --> 04:35:41.720
Orlando Sequera: a the definition of done has multiple elements.

2499
04:35:42.060 --> 04:35:48.149
Orlando Sequera: and you might be wondering. Well, we we talked about the acceptance criteria that is applicable to both

2500
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:57.620
Orlando Sequera: predictive approaches and agile or adaptive approaches we as an acceptance criteria, because it's a if they come.

2501
04:35:58.230 --> 04:36:12.059
Orlando Sequera: It's a criteria that covers all the elements that we have to be able to complete in order to to to say that a deliverable was completed. That is specific, added at the requirement level.

2502
04:36:12.689 --> 04:36:13.550
Orlando Sequera: But

2503
04:36:13.770 --> 04:36:16.589
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to agile we use

2504
04:36:17.130 --> 04:36:24.490
Orlando Sequera: another checklist, which is the definition of done, because we all the if we only rely on this specific

2505
04:36:25.180 --> 04:36:27.289
Orlando Sequera: acceptance criteria for each.

2506
04:36:27.380 --> 04:36:34.749
Orlando Sequera: A specific user story. And we don't have a global checklist that covers important aspects.

2507
04:36:34.919 --> 04:36:39.879
Orlando Sequera: Things might fall through the cracks like quality aspects. And

2508
04:36:39.890 --> 04:36:57.269
Orlando Sequera: a all the security aspects, for example. So we gotta have a global list. And, By the way, the acceptance criteria is an element of the definition of done. And that's how, by meeting checking all those boxes in that checklist. That's how we can say that something is

2509
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:59.970
Orlando Sequera: done. A 100% done. Done.

2510
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:02.660
Orlando Sequera: One big difference that we have

2511
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:07.110
Orlando Sequera: comparing agile to predictive is that

2512
04:37:07.580 --> 04:37:10.800
Orlando Sequera: in predictive we can track progress.

2513
04:37:11.090 --> 04:37:13.670
Orlando Sequera: For example, when we compare our

2514
04:37:13.840 --> 04:37:15.110
Orlando Sequera: performance

2515
04:37:15.130 --> 04:37:20.820
Orlando Sequera: we started a project, and we plan to complete this project in 3 months.

2516
04:37:21.400 --> 04:37:36.550
Orlando Sequera: That's what we're gonna. That's what we said that it was gonna take us to to complete this project, and we can it then at at any given point in time we can track our progress. So right now, activities a B and C are 85% complete.

2517
04:37:36.640 --> 04:37:52.760
Orlando Sequera: or 90% complete or 75% complete percentage of completion. Right Compare we Can we do that in predictive voting agile? That's not the case. It's either done or not done. That's a major difference between

2518
04:37:52.770 --> 04:38:10.090
Orlando Sequera: agile and predictive in agile. We don't have 85% on 99%. On No, we have it's either. Done, so we gotta be able to check every single item in both the acceptance criteria and the definition of done, which, by the way.

2519
04:38:10.570 --> 04:38:28.480
Orlando Sequera: the acceptance criteria is one of the boxes that you have in the definition of Don. If you cannot do that, you are not done, You, Don't, you have a 100 items that you check 99 there's one missing that is not complete. You are not done so that's one big difference between agile

2520
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:34.180
Orlando Sequera: and predictive and predictive. We use percentage of completion in agile. We don't okay

2521
04:38:35.919 --> 04:38:37.650
Orlando Sequera: a little bit more

2522
04:38:42.279 --> 04:38:48.669
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to reprioritizing. This has to happen at the end of each iteration.

2523
04:38:49.040 --> 04:38:54.709
Orlando Sequera: because priorities change prior to this, this is how agile can accommodate change.

2524
04:38:55.160 --> 04:38:55.930
Orlando Sequera: A.

2525
04:38:56.580 --> 04:39:01.720
Orlando Sequera: The product owner and the team are gonna work together in moving items

2526
04:39:01.860 --> 04:39:08.429
Orlando Sequera: from the actual product backlog to the iteration or or spring backlog

2527
04:39:08.680 --> 04:39:12.470
Orlando Sequera: for the next print, right? That's what happens in spring planning.

2528
04:39:12.930 --> 04:39:14.170
Orlando Sequera: And

2529
04:39:14.509 --> 04:39:16.510
Orlando Sequera: in this print planning meeting.

2530
04:39:17.180 --> 04:39:22.000
Orlando Sequera: They're gonna make those decisions, and that's where also the team is gonna get

2531
04:39:22.020 --> 04:39:32.460
Orlando Sequera: verification. They're going to have questions to the product owner about the features that they have to develop. Okay, Mr. Mrs. Pont, the product owner.

2532
04:39:33.060 --> 04:39:35.840
Orlando Sequera: This report this accounts payable report.

2533
04:39:35.860 --> 04:39:44.500
Orlando Sequera: What format do you want to see this reporting? Is it a Pdf report? Is that an excel expression? Is it a word document, what fields you want to see?

2534
04:39:44.530 --> 04:39:46.329
Orlando Sequera: What callers do you want to see?

2535
04:39:46.660 --> 04:40:01.360
Orlando Sequera: A. What funds do you want us to use? What size of the phones. So all those questions is this report feeding on the reports? Are all the reports fitting into this report. That's where they get all that clarification.

2536
04:40:01.390 --> 04:40:13.029
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so they can then understand it really well, and break it down. Break that user story down into tasks. That's done directly by the team

2537
04:40:13.210 --> 04:40:19.550
Orlando Sequera: team itself. It's a self-organized unit that is going to break down those features in or user stories into tasks.

2538
04:40:19.790 --> 04:40:23.489
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so that's what happens when we

2539
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:28.450
Orlando Sequera: a we prior to say, with with back to the

2540
04:40:29.240 --> 04:40:30.880
Orlando Sequera: in iteration background.

2541
04:40:34.520 --> 04:40:37.579
Orlando Sequera: an example of hybrid scheduling models.

2542
04:40:38.260 --> 04:40:43.710
Orlando Sequera: The project manager is going to work on planning high-level project faces a

2543
04:40:43.980 --> 04:40:53.529
Orlando Sequera: like we do with traditional. But then the scrum master is going to run sprints using agile processes that can happen that can coexist at the same time.

2544
04:40:53.640 --> 04:40:58.899
Orlando Sequera: Okay, there's not really a set hybrid scheduling model like it is like.

2545
04:40:59.090 --> 04:41:08.690
Orlando Sequera: like, at least for predictive or agile. You can combine. You can combine aspects of predictive, and add an agile

2546
04:41:08.960 --> 04:41:16.839
Orlando Sequera: it that fit the project the best way possible. You can combine that a a very common way of doing this is

2547
04:41:17.040 --> 04:41:19.200
high level planning

2548
04:41:19.390 --> 04:41:31.370
Orlando Sequera: in predictive methods with agile execution processes. Okay, that's what we actually did in the Artemis program at a high level. We had faces and masters.

2549
04:41:31.880 --> 04:41:36.039
Orlando Sequera: Remember that the item is program we were working. It's basically

2550
04:41:36.490 --> 04:41:39.949
Orlando Sequera: 3 programs working together. We have

2551
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:46.019
Orlando Sequera: that will probably allow to to explain this hybrid scheduling model.

2552
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:54.069
Orlando Sequera: We have it's basically 3 programs working together in the arms program. You have a some.

2553
04:41:54.220 --> 04:41:55.130
Orlando Sequera: a

2554
04:41:55.160 --> 04:42:00.320
Orlando Sequera: government contractors developing. They they rocket the Artemis.

2555
04:42:00.400 --> 04:42:01.510
Orlando Sequera: The actual.

2556
04:42:02.450 --> 04:42:04.170
Orlando Sequera: A RAM is rocket.

2557
04:42:04.530 --> 04:42:06.969
Orlando Sequera: and they were working

2558
04:42:07.170 --> 04:42:10.410
Orlando Sequera: mainly for the rocket. You have.

2559
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:24.029
Orlando Sequera: It was Boing. It is going working that the principal contractor working on developing the the actual rocket and working with other subcontracting companies and working with some units of NASA. So

2560
04:42:24.860 --> 04:42:32.890
Orlando Sequera: then we had another important aspect of the program, which is the spacecraft, Orion, the Orion spacecraft.

2561
04:42:33.010 --> 04:42:35.630
Orlando Sequera: That is mainly

2562
04:42:36.700 --> 04:42:55.020
Orlando Sequera: it. We have a mainly at the contracting company. We we have a big contracting company that is in charge of a working with for some reason, and for giving the name they but it's not going. It's a different company that is working with their main tasks is

2563
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:57.039
Orlando Sequera: to develop that

2564
04:42:57.150 --> 04:42:58.640
Orlando Sequera: Orion spacecraft.

2565
04:42:58.690 --> 04:42:59.630
Orlando Sequera: And

2566
04:43:00.040 --> 04:43:04.560
Orlando Sequera: so those are 2 big components, right? But then the third one is

2567
04:43:05.330 --> 04:43:10.589
Orlando Sequera: all their they the the space, the spacecraft Airport, or

2568
04:43:10.800 --> 04:43:13.710
Orlando Sequera: a that NASA Canada Space Center

2569
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:31.820
Orlando Sequera: that is, imagine the best way to to understand is like at least like an airport for for rockets. That's what it is, and that's where the processing happens, and that's where a everything is going to be. A everything is going to be put together. They're bracket.

2570
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:47.940
Orlando Sequera: the actual spacecraft and the payload that is going to be in that in that rocket, right? That's pretty much at a very high level. How it works. So you have 3 different programs working with multiple contracting companies, and, of course, multiple levels of government

2571
04:43:48.280 --> 04:43:57.889
Orlando Sequera: that are coordinated by multiple a department a within NASA. Okay. So it's a it's a major endeavor. So

2572
04:43:58.130 --> 04:44:02.370
Orlando Sequera: at the high level, the actual, the planning

2573
04:44:02.410 --> 04:44:16.779
Orlando Sequera: that he started a high level to make sure that we are all coordinated with each other. He's done using a predictive approach that is done at a following a predictive approach. We have milestones that we have to hit. So

2574
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:23.640
Orlando Sequera: program ABC we are hitting the same milestones. We have a master schedule

2575
04:44:23.720 --> 04:44:28.489
Orlando Sequera: with milestones that we all have to hip, and we are.

2576
04:44:28.510 --> 04:44:30.970
Orlando Sequera: There are dependencies that need to be

2577
04:44:31.570 --> 04:44:54.009
Orlando Sequera: that that need to be completed, and we use that and a predictive approach to address that. But when it comes to development, and that's where a my project, for example, working with a ground flight application software G fast developing that for processing a the spacecraft mainly, and the Artemis rocket as well.

2578
04:44:54.210 --> 04:44:56.769
Orlando Sequera: and that integration happened a

2579
04:44:56.940 --> 04:44:59.510
Orlando Sequera: that was done using an agile approach

2580
04:44:59.590 --> 04:45:05.360
Orlando Sequera: that was not using an agile approach, so that flexibility. That's what we mean by hybrid.

2581
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:19.040
Orlando Sequera: That's what we mean by habit. So at the high level we did it, using a predictive approach. But at the development level or software development in this specific case and many other areas there were there. There were some other areas.

2582
04:45:19.160 --> 04:45:24.340
Orlando Sequera: If for those who were developing the software that was used by the

2583
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:42.060
Orlando Sequera: by the Orion spacecraft. For example, they were following an agile approach as well, because they had to replicate conditions in outer space, using very complex simulators and using

2584
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:57.710
Orlando Sequera: to replicate as much as possible it what will be the impact on the spacecraft when it was when when it gets exposed to these temperatures and these pressures, etc. A. What would be the behavior? So to to make adjustments, so for that they use

2585
04:45:57.730 --> 04:46:15.649
Orlando Sequera: prototype, they use an agile approach. But then again, we all came together under the same umbrella of following, For that integration it was easier to use predictive approach, so they can coexist if they is, is basically is perfectly fine.

2586
04:46:15.660 --> 04:46:33.019
Orlando Sequera: I know that some of you might. We're asking about hybrid. How so? It's basically looking at both aspects. We have covered them, but it's when you use both approaches together it is possible to use it in a project in the same project. It's perfectly fine. If that's what's gonna do the work. If that's what's gonna

2587
04:46:33.060 --> 04:46:43.280
Orlando Sequera: be the best fit. By all means you can do it. Okay, it's perfectly fine. It's going to allow you to be more a efficient. Okay. So it's perfectly fine.

2588
04:46:44.320 --> 04:46:45.330
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2589
04:46:48.000 --> 04:46:50.660
Orlando Sequera: We have gone over this schedule.

2590
04:46:50.710 --> 04:46:57.149
Orlando Sequera: and we went over the predictive approach versus the elective approach. We went over the project tasks.

2591
04:46:57.330 --> 04:47:04.730
Orlando Sequera: We understand what our milestone is dependencies, and we talked about user story points. That's what we use to estimate

2592
04:47:04.850 --> 04:47:06.730
Orlando Sequera: the level of effort in agile.

2593
04:47:07.170 --> 04:47:11.789
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about benchmarking and historical data, and how

2594
04:47:12.020 --> 04:47:15.059
Orlando Sequera: to prepare the schedule based on the methodology.

2595
04:47:23.940 --> 04:47:27.359
Orlando Sequera: Now we're going to start talking about resources.

2596
04:47:27.710 --> 04:47:30.370
Orlando Sequera: But before that i'm going to.

2597
04:47:30.770 --> 04:47:33.879
Orlando Sequera: I'm gonna take a look at the questions that we have in the Q. And a.

2598
04:47:34.000 --> 04:47:37.150
Orlando Sequera: To make sure that they get addressed before

2599
04:47:37.810 --> 04:47:39.130
Orlando Sequera: we continue.

2600
04:47:42.290 --> 04:47:47.059
Orlando Sequera: Remember to vote on the questions. And those are the ones that are going to

2601
04:47:49.040 --> 04:47:51.050
Orlando Sequera: a get answered first.

2602
04:47:57.550 --> 04:48:03.829
Orlando Sequera: There's a question. If you not if you do not use percentage, a progress in agile.

2603
04:48:03.870 --> 04:48:08.110
Orlando Sequera: how do you? As a project manager. Determine that the correct team is ahead

2604
04:48:08.340 --> 04:48:13.129
Orlando Sequera: on or behind a meeting the Spring Release Date. Great question.

2605
04:48:13.550 --> 04:48:22.270
Orlando Sequera: Can you use earn value management in agile. Yes, so yes, you can use earn value management in agile. But you are going. What you're going to compare is.

2606
04:48:22.970 --> 04:48:27.900
Orlando Sequera: remember that in spring planning the team is gonna make a commitment to the liver.

2607
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:32.160
Orlando Sequera: An X amount of user stories

2608
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:33.300
Orlando Sequera: so.

2609
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:37.430
Orlando Sequera: and value management is basically comparing actuals.

2610
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:50.730
Orlando Sequera: What was done to what we planned for. You can do that. Imagine, too, but what you're gonna compare in this case is okay. You said that you were gonna complete 30 user story points, but you only completed 20

2611
04:48:51.250 --> 04:48:52.690
Orlando Sequera: user story points.

2612
04:48:53.010 --> 04:49:10.999
Orlando Sequera: so that definitely you can you can perform. You can measure progress. That's how you do it. But there's no percentage of completion. Imagine, but you can still make your progress, and you use other tools like burn down charts and burn up charts that also can help you to measure progress. So a

2613
04:49:11.560 --> 04:49:16.069
Orlando Sequera: you still you are still able to measure progress in agile.

2614
04:49:17.620 --> 04:49:24.459
Orlando Sequera: You can still use earn value management, but it is a little bit different. But you put in Nigel. There's no percentage of completion.

2615
04:49:24.710 --> 04:49:26.829
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so great great question.

2616
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:48.380
Orlando Sequera: When this slide says, measure effort, not time. What is the You know what? We'd refrain. Focus on duration. And you're going to be fine. But when he says, measure effort, that is for adjun. Okay, measure effort. Not time. That is specifically for agile. What is the unit of measure

2617
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:54.349
Orlando Sequera: and user-story points or t-shirt sizes, for example. So that is the answer to

2618
04:49:54.970 --> 04:49:57.190
Orlando Sequera: that is the answer to the question.

2619
04:50:03.540 --> 04:50:04.830
Orlando Sequera: right?

2620
04:50:06.170 --> 04:50:11.960
Orlando Sequera: Is there an example of a D or checklist definition already? So

2621
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:14.200
Orlando Sequera: that's the other thing? Create the

2622
04:50:14.970 --> 04:50:23.770
Orlando Sequera: they? Yes, this the definition of ready checklist is created by the team. It's gonna change from project to project. But the team is gonna tell you this is what we need

2623
04:50:24.260 --> 04:50:31.369
Orlando Sequera: to complete the project. They the iteration work. This is what this is what we need in order to complete that work.

2624
04:50:31.390 --> 04:50:38.690
Orlando Sequera: So it is created by the team, and it's going to change from a project to project and also from iteration to iteration.

2625
04:50:38.900 --> 04:50:43.820
Orlando Sequera: So yeah, that's created by the team specific to that particular iteration.

2626
04:50:54.930 --> 04:50:56.330
Okay.

2627
04:51:04.480 --> 04:51:12.110
Orlando Sequera: A question regarding flow calculation. Understand how to calculate early Star nearly finish how you determine. If there is an air early star.

2628
04:51:12.750 --> 04:51:14.730
Orlando Sequera: and we start early. Finish.

2629
04:51:15.300 --> 04:51:20.039
Orlando Sequera: Do you have to perform? But forward, pass, and backward past to calculate

2630
04:51:20.170 --> 04:51:21.540
Orlando Sequera: at least totally finish

2631
04:51:21.680 --> 04:51:22.770
Orlando Sequera: or pass

2632
04:51:23.010 --> 04:51:24.870
Orlando Sequera: late. Startly. Finish is

2633
04:51:24.920 --> 04:51:26.180
Orlando Sequera: backward pass.

2634
04:51:26.610 --> 04:51:27.829
Orlando Sequera: What, again

2635
04:51:27.980 --> 04:51:38.050
Orlando Sequera: A. By recommendation is you're going to do a deeper dive. They are videos in per sepio. You can watch them, and that can help you

2636
04:51:38.290 --> 04:51:40.980
Orlando Sequera: to learn a little bit to do a deeper dive.

2637
04:51:41.010 --> 04:51:52.319
Orlando Sequera: But for the exam most of the questions are not. They're They're not gonna that's not what they're looking for. For this version of the Pmp extent. There's a reason why we didn't do a deeper dive from that.

2638
04:51:52.570 --> 04:51:53.630
Orlando Sequera: That's why

2639
04:51:54.100 --> 04:51:54.740
Orlando Sequera: okay.

2640
04:52:02.140 --> 04:52:09.869
Orlando Sequera: it's a definition of Don't created by devops and use, but not definition of done is created by the team a.

2641
04:52:12.120 --> 04:52:29.489
Orlando Sequera: E. But you have to get your stakeholders in on the same page. Everyone has to be on the same page. The team, the product owner, your stakeholders. Everyone has to be on the same page when it comes to the definition of that. But it's not created by other people. It's created by the team in collaboration

2642
04:52:29.500 --> 04:52:33.340
Orlando Sequera: with stakeholders product owner.

2643
04:52:33.440 --> 04:52:39.650
Orlando Sequera: A, and everybody has to have the same definition of done otherwise. It's going to be a disaster.

2644
04:52:40.120 --> 04:52:41.690
Orlando Sequera: How can you measure

2645
04:52:41.740 --> 04:52:43.710
Orlando Sequera: team velocity by

2646
04:52:43.790 --> 04:52:48.920
Orlando Sequera: calculating how many user story points have they been able to complete?

2647
04:52:49.880 --> 04:52:51.370
Orlando Sequera: That's how you measure that.

2648
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:59.460
Orlando Sequera: It could be 30 story user story points or 40 user story points in the next screen or 15 in the next print.

2649
04:52:59.550 --> 04:53:02.550
Orlando Sequera: That's how you and then the

2650
04:53:02.620 --> 04:53:11.750
Orlando Sequera: it's based. That's basically how you do it? It's about how quickly can they finish when they complete user store points.

2651
04:53:15.560 --> 04:53:16.320
right?

2652
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:38.809
Orlando Sequera: And could you please speak to Iteration H on on slide 77 this is just a

2653
04:53:40.000 --> 04:53:46.110
Orlando Sequera: It's just a spring cycle where we're the point of released. Yes, it's a group of iterations that we are deploying

2654
04:53:47.020 --> 04:53:50.040
Orlando Sequera: that we are using to deploy

2655
04:53:50.280 --> 04:53:53.249
Orlando Sequera: to release into production. Yes.

2656
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:04.589
Orlando Sequera: who creates a definition of

2657
04:54:04.700 --> 04:54:13.050
Orlando Sequera: Don? I may. I already answered that that is the team in collaboration with stakeholders and the

2658
04:54:13.340 --> 04:54:16.219
Orlando Sequera: we all they all need to be on the same page.

2659
04:54:22.850 --> 04:54:28.349
Orlando Sequera: Can definition already, and definition of Don't be quantified, not quantified? They need to be

2660
04:54:28.620 --> 04:54:33.670
Orlando Sequera: clearly define. They are items on a checklist.

2661
04:54:34.500 --> 04:54:39.040
Orlando Sequera: That's what they are, and we need to be on the same page with everyone as I mentioned

2662
04:54:39.720 --> 04:54:40.829
Orlando Sequera: not Toronto.

2663
04:54:41.010 --> 04:54:46.199
Orlando Sequera: Another question is there an acceptable reason for a blown, busted timeline and a for a project. I

2664
04:54:46.700 --> 04:54:53.340
Orlando Sequera: don't understand, really the context of the question. You would have to elaborate more, but you would do this planning

2665
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:55.450
Orlando Sequera: to avoid disasters.

2666
04:54:59.310 --> 04:55:01.820
Orlando Sequera: Another question

2667
04:55:06.010 --> 04:55:07.290
Orlando Sequera: A.

2668
04:55:15.020 --> 04:55:18.829
Orlando Sequera: My apologies i'm trying to find

2669
04:55:20.920 --> 04:55:22.380
Orlando Sequera: the story points

2670
04:55:22.660 --> 04:55:38.590
Orlando Sequera: ever get related to or assigned to a crew and respect the duration. No, no, no, that's a bad practice story. Point is just about the level of effort. The level of complexity. It's about the level of complexity. They shouldn't be tied up to duration they shouldn't be.

2671
04:55:39.480 --> 04:55:48.489
Orlando Sequera: I know that some organizations try to get sneaky about it. But no, it has not, it should should have nothing to do with duration.

2672
04:55:49.290 --> 04:55:52.029
Orlando Sequera: It's just about complexity. How complex.

2673
04:55:52.320 --> 04:55:54.620
Orlando Sequera: how complex it is!

2674
04:55:55.050 --> 04:55:55.900
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2675
04:55:58.430 --> 04:56:01.330
Orlando Sequera: Let's continue. And

2676
04:56:09.640 --> 04:56:12.009
Orlando Sequera: Actually, we're getting close to

2677
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:13.340
Orlando Sequera: our.

2678
04:56:24.800 --> 04:56:27.560
Orlando Sequera: We're getting awfully close to our break.

2679
04:56:28.760 --> 04:56:33.800
Orlando Sequera: Let's take a 10 min break and we'll be back. We're gonna continue

2680
04:56:34.560 --> 04:56:36.629
Orlando Sequera: it with a confidence. I'm, we're going to.

2681
04:56:36.700 --> 04:56:39.679
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna talk about resources right? So

2682
04:56:41.920 --> 04:56:44.710
Orlando Sequera: take a 10 min break and we will be right back.

2683
04:57:03.310 --> 04:57:05.610
Orlando Sequera: All right. Welcome back

2684
04:57:05.640 --> 04:57:06.859
Orlando Sequera: my apologies.

2685
04:57:07.400 --> 04:57:09.799
Orlando Sequera: We're going to continue with our

2686
04:57:10.900 --> 04:57:12.030
Orlando Sequera: us.

2687
04:57:13.290 --> 04:57:14.560
Orlando Sequera: and

2688
04:57:19.900 --> 04:57:22.070
Orlando Sequera: we have

2689
04:57:25.130 --> 04:57:32.799
Orlando Sequera: 2 more topics to go over. So we're going to talk about resources now. So we have talked about scope. We have talked about

2690
04:57:34.320 --> 04:57:35.390
Orlando Sequera: schedule.

2691
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:37.620
Orlando Sequera: Now we're going to talk about resources.

2692
04:57:38.650 --> 04:57:40.120
Orlando Sequera: As we have said.

2693
04:57:41.480 --> 04:57:49.909
Orlando Sequera: we need resources to complete those project activities, but when it comes to resources it's not only about

2694
04:57:52.020 --> 04:57:55.500
Orlando Sequera: human resources, right? It's not just the people that

2695
04:57:56.530 --> 04:58:01.260
Orlando Sequera: it's needed to complete project activities. We're talking also about

2696
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:04.350
Orlando Sequera: equipment.

2697
04:58:05.160 --> 04:58:11.519
Orlando Sequera: We're talking also about materials, and we're also talking about supplies.

2698
04:58:11.710 --> 04:58:13.260
Orlando Sequera: That is.

2699
04:58:13.680 --> 04:58:15.270
Orlando Sequera: it's really important

2700
04:58:15.370 --> 04:58:20.629
Orlando Sequera: to keep in mind. So we're talking a little bit more about than just

2701
04:58:21.680 --> 04:58:29.949
Orlando Sequera: human resources. Okay, so this is another area. This is another area that we have to make sure

2702
04:58:30.660 --> 04:58:32.830
Orlando Sequera: that we're covering for our project.

2703
04:58:32.910 --> 04:58:47.819
Orlando Sequera: Okay, so we're still in planning. We're we're working. We're doing our our planning efforts. And this is another important area, an area of our project, because without research set the pro without people and without equipment, materials and supplies.

2704
04:58:48.090 --> 04:58:52.230
Orlando Sequera: We're not going to be able to do anything with our project, so we need to

2705
04:58:52.320 --> 04:58:57.930
Orlando Sequera: spend the time and start with our plan for this resources

2706
04:58:58.450 --> 04:59:00.180
Orlando Sequera: in defining.

2707
04:59:01.380 --> 04:59:05.439
Orlando Sequera: How can we identify the type of resources that we need?

2708
04:59:06.630 --> 04:59:07.989
Orlando Sequera: How are we going to do that?

2709
04:59:08.010 --> 04:59:14.719
Orlando Sequera: The people and the materials and equipment and supplies? How are we going to acquire these resources?

2710
04:59:15.170 --> 04:59:21.389
Orlando Sequera: Are they going to be assigned within the organization. Do we have to go outside of the organization?

2711
04:59:21.790 --> 04:59:25.270
Orlando Sequera: How's that going to be done? That's going to be answered by the plan.

2712
04:59:25.550 --> 04:59:29.900
Orlando Sequera: and we need to also understand the roles and responsibilities

2713
04:59:29.950 --> 04:59:36.160
Orlando Sequera: of the people that are, be. They are going to be working in those project activities. The role is the function

2714
04:59:36.240 --> 04:59:44.270
Orlando Sequera: in the project. We also need to know the authority, what are the rights that they have to use resources to make decisions and accept the Liberals

2715
04:59:44.520 --> 04:59:46.100
Orlando Sequera: the responsibility

2716
04:59:46.630 --> 04:59:51.599
Orlando Sequera: that is, the assigned duty and competencies and skill set that is needed to

2717
04:59:51.750 --> 05:00:03.110
Orlando Sequera: perform the work. All of that's going to be defined in the resource management plan. Again, the rules of engagement, the rules that we have to follow when it comes to our resources.

2718
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:06.380
Orlando Sequera: We need to have a project organizational chart

2719
05:00:07.020 --> 05:00:11.089
Orlando Sequera: that shows reporting relationships that is very helpful.

2720
05:00:11.800 --> 05:00:28.519
Orlando Sequera: Also, we need to take into account a resource management how we're going to select those resources, how we're going to manage those resources. How we're going to release those resources. Because, remember, projects have a definite beginning, and they also have a definite end. So

2721
05:00:28.830 --> 05:00:47.190
Orlando Sequera: not all. Not every single team member is gonna be it's gonna be part of the team for the entire duration of the project. Some of them are gonna come at a specific time. When they complete their productivity, they're going to be released. They're going to be adjourn, as we saw with the talkman ladder stage. Okay.

2722
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:55.730
Orlando Sequera: Another important aspect that we have to take into consideration when it comes to resource management planning is training.

2723
05:00:56.580 --> 05:01:07.460
Orlando Sequera: In most cases we're not gonna have all this skill set available there. We might need some training that happens a lot, but we are under

2724
05:01:07.850 --> 05:01:09.360
Orlando Sequera: the

2725
05:01:10.540 --> 05:01:15.219
Orlando Sequera: We're going to be a under the actual

2726
05:01:16.740 --> 05:01:23.970
Orlando Sequera: We we're gonna be in the business of developing people of training people. So we have. We have to work

2727
05:01:24.100 --> 05:01:35.420
Orlando Sequera: we have to work with our stakeholders to with internal stakeholders in this case, with our team members to develop them. Okay, to help to develop that skill set as much as possible.

2728
05:01:35.490 --> 05:01:39.959
Orlando Sequera: But we need to figure out the best strategy for that, and also take into account that that

2729
05:01:40.690 --> 05:01:53.529
Orlando Sequera: that training is gonna cost money. So it's gonna have an impact on our project budget, and it's also gonna have an impact on our scheduled it's gonna take time. So we have to take those impacts into consideration.

2730
05:01:53.540 --> 05:02:04.089
Orlando Sequera: Also, the team development methods. We're going to be able to figure out a way to work together. And how are we going to control those resources. Research, recognition.

2731
05:02:04.290 --> 05:02:06.950
Orlando Sequera: The the research recognition plan. Okay.

2732
05:02:08.400 --> 05:02:09.210
Orlando Sequera: All right.

2733
05:02:22.660 --> 05:02:25.980
Orlando Sequera: If we are using a predictive approach.

2734
05:02:26.110 --> 05:02:28.010
Orlando Sequera: And you see the symbol here.

2735
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:34.559
Orlando Sequera: the project manager is going to identify the required team resources, and then

2736
05:02:34.830 --> 05:02:38.249
Orlando Sequera: they're going to be assigned to the different project activities, right?

2737
05:02:39.560 --> 05:02:44.329
Orlando Sequera: It is important to identify the right resources to perform

2738
05:02:44.380 --> 05:02:50.499
Orlando Sequera: the work. This is based on experience. Does the team member have the relevant experience to perform the work?

2739
05:02:50.790 --> 05:02:52.709
Orlando Sequera: Do they have the knowledge

2740
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:55.810
Orlando Sequera: they have information about customer needs

2741
05:02:55.980 --> 05:02:59.440
Orlando Sequera: and prior similar product implementations

2742
05:02:59.660 --> 05:03:02.690
Orlando Sequera: Do they have the relevant skill set that is needed?

2743
05:03:02.710 --> 05:03:11.950
Orlando Sequera: Is the team member able to work well with others the same? Do they have the actual do they have the

2744
05:03:12.770 --> 05:03:19.829
Orlando Sequera: Can they work? Well, we're well with other people, so that is very important, because we're going to be working under a team setting.

2745
05:03:19.900 --> 05:03:21.960
Orlando Sequera: So that's how it gets done

2746
05:03:22.180 --> 05:03:23.100
Orlando Sequera: in

2747
05:03:23.450 --> 05:03:26.309
Orlando Sequera: if we're following a predictive approach.

2748
05:03:26.560 --> 05:03:44.740
Orlando Sequera: the responsibilities are going to be tailored, based on the team and the needs of the project, and you'll take into account, As I mentioned before, not only the skill set the technical knowledge, but also the actual soft skills like being

2749
05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:59.969
Orlando Sequera: able to work with other people being able to work with people in in in in a team that is diverse, and people that you have in multiple in multiple locations. Right? So that is something that needs to be taken into account

2750
05:04:00.360 --> 05:04:01.640
Orlando Sequera: one

2751
05:04:02.010 --> 05:04:03.620
Orlando Sequera: tool that we use

2752
05:04:07.300 --> 05:04:09.610
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to resources.

2753
05:04:10.790 --> 05:04:13.100
Orlando Sequera: and that is really helpful

2754
05:04:13.330 --> 05:04:18.639
Orlando Sequera: in understanding. When are these resources available? Because remember what we said

2755
05:04:18.740 --> 05:04:26.699
Orlando Sequera: on day one re projects and operations. They have differences, but they have one common element.

2756
05:04:26.830 --> 05:04:30.109
Orlando Sequera: They have many, but one of those common elements is

2757
05:04:30.640 --> 05:04:31.990
Orlando Sequera: resources.

2758
05:04:32.060 --> 05:04:39.939
Orlando Sequera: organizations. They don't have separate resources for projects and separate resources for the daily operations. No, it's the same resources. Okay.

2759
05:04:40.050 --> 05:04:45.160
Orlando Sequera: The same resources that are going to be working on project work, and they're also going to be working on

2760
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:47.789
Orlando Sequera: a project work. So that

2761
05:04:47.920 --> 05:04:53.270
Orlando Sequera: means that there is a coordination that needs to happen for

2762
05:04:53.350 --> 05:05:01.949
Orlando Sequera: those for those resources. And remember what we said before about this structure, the organization with structures they are.

2763
05:05:03.210 --> 05:05:07.540
Orlando Sequera: Chances are that our level of a 30 go. It's going to be

2764
05:05:08.090 --> 05:05:22.060
Orlando Sequera: medium to low. In most cases it's going to be low. I would even venture to say that as Project manager studies, so that means that the resources are going to be reporting to a functional manager. So we have to coordinate

2765
05:05:22.700 --> 05:05:25.499
Orlando Sequera: this resource availability, and remember

2766
05:05:25.530 --> 05:05:43.859
Orlando Sequera: that your project is not the only project that these resources are going to be working on, or it's not the only project that is going to need a a particular piece of equipment or a specific type of material. You have multiple competing projects

2767
05:05:44.040 --> 05:05:54.270
Orlando Sequera: that are competing for the same resources. So this is key. This is one way that will allow you to make sure that the resources that you need

2768
05:05:54.510 --> 05:06:00.649
Orlando Sequera: are available when you need them. So you use resource calendars for that

2769
05:06:00.780 --> 05:06:07.230
Orlando Sequera: for for for that particular coordination. It's going to allow you to understand resource, availability

2770
05:06:08.020 --> 05:06:24.239
Orlando Sequera: of people, equipment material supplies during a specific point. So when you start your planning efforts, and you are adding resources to your project tasks or activities in your schedule. You're not adding people that are that are unavailable

2771
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:43.380
Orlando Sequera: that are a overloaded with work over allocated, or that are not, They are out of due to They they their own vacation, or they're out on a on sick leave, etc. So you have to use this resource calendars

2772
05:06:43.410 --> 05:06:44.220
Orlando Sequera: to

2773
05:06:44.260 --> 05:06:51.530
Orlando Sequera: coordinate that resource allocation for your project to understand and to prefer

2774
05:06:51.620 --> 05:07:00.160
Orlando Sequera: okay, keeping those constraints and limitations that I mentioned before. They all the project work and operational work.

2775
05:07:01.640 --> 05:07:06.379
Orlando Sequera: One tool that I mentioned that is really important when it comes to

2776
05:07:06.580 --> 05:07:11.260
Orlando Sequera: who's gonna be working on what? When it comes to the resources when it comes to the team.

2777
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:13.030
Orlando Sequera: This is

2778
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:16.510
Orlando Sequera: a very important tool that is going to help you to understand

2779
05:07:16.560 --> 05:07:21.079
Orlando Sequera: a who's going to be working on a specific task? Who's going to be responsible

2780
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:23.980
Orlando Sequera: for a completing a specific

2781
05:07:24.040 --> 05:07:26.959
Orlando Sequera: activity, productivity, or task in the project.

2782
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:31.080
Orlando Sequera: That is the racing matrix

2783
05:07:31.600 --> 05:07:36.270
Orlando Sequera: race. It comes from responsible, accountable, consult, and inform.

2784
05:07:36.550 --> 05:07:38.420
Orlando Sequera: Racing matrix is

2785
05:07:38.480 --> 05:07:43.229
Orlando Sequera: key. It is important. It's going to keep everyone on the same page.

2786
05:07:43.370 --> 05:07:44.360
Orlando Sequera: It's gonna

2787
05:07:44.680 --> 05:07:54.230
Orlando Sequera: properly it Define who's responsible for completing a task, as I just mentioned. Also, who has to make sure that those tasks

2788
05:07:54.250 --> 05:07:55.300
Orlando Sequera: get done

2789
05:07:55.630 --> 05:07:56.760
Orlando Sequera: accountable.

2790
05:07:56.820 --> 05:08:10.069
Orlando Sequera: 2 different things accountable is the individual that has to make sure that the task gets done. Okay, that's accountable. But it's not necessarily the same individual that is going to be doing it.

2791
05:08:10.560 --> 05:08:11.280
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2792
05:08:11.330 --> 05:08:23.219
Orlando Sequera: that is the responsible party, the responsible they got to do it accountable has to make sure that the task gets done or completed, then consult. In some cases

2793
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:24.600
Orlando Sequera: the

2794
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:30.700
Orlando Sequera: you need to consult some other people, Some stakeholders outside of the team ask some questions.

2795
05:08:30.740 --> 05:08:49.800
Orlando Sequera: but a They're not they. They're not going to be mandated. It's not mandatory to have a consult or individual to consult an individual for each specific task. Not every task needs to consult a particular individual, but every task needs

2796
05:08:49.810 --> 05:09:00.150
Orlando Sequera: to have someone accountable, and every task needs to have at least one responsible person. They need to get done right. And then in form, we have some stakeholders that need to be informed.

2797
05:09:00.750 --> 05:09:15.639
Orlando Sequera: but especially about project progress, because they might have an impact, but they don't need detailed information. So that is what the racy matrix is. And by the way, the racing matrix is a

2798
05:09:15.650 --> 05:09:23.639
Orlando Sequera: it. It's an evolution of what they call the responsibility assignment matrix the RAM. This is a flavor of a RAM, and

2799
05:09:23.650 --> 05:09:42.620
Orlando Sequera: it is so important that the racing matrix is one of the ways that one of the tools that you can use to even prevent conflict in your team setting in conflict within people in your project team because one of the most common, Causes of conflict is

2800
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:51.899
Orlando Sequera: lack of clarity when it comes to the roles. Lack of clarity when it comes to who's responsible for doing a project? Tasks

2801
05:09:52.270 --> 05:10:00.530
Orlando Sequera: that can be addressed by using a racing matrix. This is important. Okay, remember this for the exempt

2802
05:10:08.500 --> 05:10:11.690
Orlando Sequera: a little bit of a quiz here. So

2803
05:10:13.130 --> 05:10:15.260
Orlando Sequera: which of these are

2804
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:16.200
Orlando Sequera: through?

2805
05:10:17.160 --> 05:10:19.810
Orlando Sequera: And i'm going to? I'm past the chat

2806
05:10:22.050 --> 05:10:33.139
Orlando Sequera: briefly. And which of this do you think are true. You can choose multiple, not just one. You can choose multiple which ones out of these 4 are.

2807
05:10:38.400 --> 05:10:41.830
Orlando Sequera: And I see that most of you are same.

2808
05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:44.650
Orlando Sequera: 1, 3, M. 4,

2809
05:10:44.900 --> 05:10:46.599
Orlando Sequera: and that is correct.

2810
05:10:46.780 --> 05:10:48.869
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to post the chat now.

2811
05:10:50.120 --> 05:10:56.090
Orlando Sequera: So Team self organized to distribute work, and this is about adaptive right about that. That is true.

2812
05:10:56.880 --> 05:11:01.400
Orlando Sequera: and that tip teams never have a leader. No, they do have a leader.

2813
05:11:01.460 --> 05:11:03.100
Orlando Sequera: And who is the leader?

2814
05:11:05.490 --> 05:11:07.190
Orlando Sequera: I'm going to unpause the chat.

2815
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:09.790
Orlando Sequera: Who is the leader?

2816
05:11:11.160 --> 05:11:18.549
Orlando Sequera: It could be the Pm. Or the scrum master, so both answers are correct. It could be either a Pm. Or it could be

2817
05:11:20.240 --> 05:11:23.170
Orlando Sequera: a as chrome master. So yes, that is correct.

2818
05:11:23.690 --> 05:11:37.450
Orlando Sequera: not the product owner. I'm gonna i'm gonna post the chat now, not the programmer. The procure, remember, is in charge of the scope. It's in charge of the pro backl so, but it's not the leader of the team. So the scrum master or project manager. Yes.

2819
05:11:37.650 --> 05:11:39.690
Orlando Sequera: all right. So great job guys.

2820
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:41.630
Orlando Sequera: they great on that question.

2821
05:11:41.870 --> 05:11:42.700
Orlando Sequera: Now.

2822
05:11:48.760 --> 05:11:57.130
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to resources we are going. We we mentioned something, we not always we. We're not always gonna have

2823
05:11:57.170 --> 05:12:02.029
Orlando Sequera: the resources that we need to do our project work depending on the complexity of the tasks

2824
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:10.860
Orlando Sequera: that's gonna happen in some situations. We're gonna face some situations in which it's not going to be possible it wouldn't. We don't have internally the resources

2825
05:12:11.060 --> 05:12:14.039
Orlando Sequera: we don't have the the skill set needed. We don't have

2826
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:16.399
Orlando Sequera: the actual

2827
05:12:16.490 --> 05:12:19.759
Orlando Sequera: piece of equipment. Maybe we need a specialized

2828
05:12:19.850 --> 05:12:26.550
Orlando Sequera: type of machine, or that that we don't currently have. So what do we do in that situation? So

2829
05:12:27.290 --> 05:12:42.250
Orlando Sequera: in those situations? Or we might have the resources that we need, but they are over allocated, they simply not available in the next 4, 5 months. What do we do in those situations? So, in order to

2830
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:46.429
Orlando Sequera: address those situations, we do.

2831
05:12:46.500 --> 05:12:56.150
Orlando Sequera: We can do a make, or by analysis, so we can make the best situation. Remember the project management. One key aspect of project management is to be able to

2832
05:12:57.580 --> 05:13:13.390
Orlando Sequera: a make decisions, make the best decisions. It's about decision making. That's a key aspect of project management. Sometimes it's going to be better to do it in house. That's what we call make. Make is doing it in house with internal resources.

2833
05:13:13.400 --> 05:13:23.730
Orlando Sequera: or sometimes it's going to be better to buy it or procure it, get it from a third party. So that is a that's what we mean by external sourcing.

2834
05:13:23.820 --> 05:13:31.359
Orlando Sequera: and we perform this type of analysis maker by analysis to make the best decision for the project.

2835
05:13:31.550 --> 05:13:48.149
Orlando Sequera: Okay, what we got to take into account a few considerations, hey? If we if we think about a hire, an external consultants that can help us with project work. What's going to be the impact on the cost of our project impact on the budget.

2836
05:13:48.160 --> 05:14:02.130
Orlando Sequera: The impact on the time, Impact on the schedule an impact on the quality right? So we need to take that into account. Is this gonna be something that we're gonna be needing in an ongoing basis? Or is it a one time deal?

2837
05:14:02.410 --> 05:14:18.670
Orlando Sequera: We have to ask that question as well. How steep is the learning curve for someone internally to learn that skills it. If it's something that is going to take years to learn, or if it's something that can be relatively, they can learn relatively in a short amount of time.

2838
05:14:18.680 --> 05:14:24.719
Orlando Sequera: So we're gonna take that into account as well. Do we have the require resources available within the organization.

2839
05:14:25.090 --> 05:14:38.929
Orlando Sequera: Yes, no, if no. What do we do? And we'll outsourcing? Allow the team to focus on what they need to focus on you. That is another consideration. Maybe some we outsource

2840
05:14:39.020 --> 05:14:42.220
Orlando Sequera: to external resources, some of the

2841
05:14:42.850 --> 05:14:49.550
Orlando Sequera: functionary that needs to be built, but then we can that will keep free of the team to focus on a

2842
05:14:49.920 --> 05:15:00.669
Orlando Sequera: on delivering a and delivering the important functionality for the project. So we need to take that into account. We gotta look at it from multiple a

2843
05:15:00.690 --> 05:15:12.289
Orlando Sequera: angles multiple variables. Of course this is not something that is going to be answered directly by the project man by the project manager it it himself or herself they need to.

2844
05:15:12.770 --> 05:15:27.389
Orlando Sequera: We we need to take into account a key stakeholders, the sponsor, of course, the team members, and look at all that information. But this is another way that we have in order to fill your resources. needs.

2845
05:15:28.880 --> 05:15:29.750
Orlando Sequera: Okay.

2846
05:15:38.320 --> 05:15:45.680
Orlando Sequera: Another important area of our project that is also tied up that has considerations, and it's in it. It has the impact on

2847
05:15:45.700 --> 05:15:49.280
Orlando Sequera: every other area of our project is procurement.

2848
05:15:49.990 --> 05:16:01.030
Orlando Sequera: Once we perform that maker by analysis, we determine. Is it better to do it in-house, or is it better to go outside the organization and work with a third-party organization?

2849
05:16:01.780 --> 05:16:03.140
Orlando Sequera: We have.

2850
05:16:03.240 --> 05:16:05.990
Orlando Sequera: If we decide to acquire

2851
05:16:06.220 --> 05:16:14.770
Orlando Sequera: the product service of result, what we need or the resources from outside the organization, we need to have in place a procurement strategy.

2852
05:16:14.840 --> 05:16:17.100
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that is important.

2853
05:16:17.130 --> 05:16:19.109
Orlando Sequera: It. This is where

2854
05:16:20.110 --> 05:16:32.710
Orlando Sequera: procurement strategy is gonna cover the contract types that we're going to be using. That needs to be defined in a contract is a legally binding agreement, by the way, that has obligations for both parties.

2855
05:16:33.080 --> 05:16:47.630
Orlando Sequera: and a we need to take into account any we need. This is why we review opa's, because we need to understand also any policies, any guidelines, any a.

2856
05:16:48.220 --> 05:17:07.850
Orlando Sequera: and any particular best practices that we have to follow when it comes to procurement for those that have work with the Federal Government, Federal acquisition and regulation guidelines right the far that has to be followed by any organization that is in business, doing business

2857
05:17:07.860 --> 05:17:14.530
Orlando Sequera: with the Federal Government. They're subject to far regulations, right? So the same principle here.

2858
05:17:15.160 --> 05:17:16.240
Orlando Sequera: and

2859
05:17:17.300 --> 05:17:20.120
Orlando Sequera: you have to plan mainly for

2860
05:17:20.330 --> 05:17:27.120
Orlando Sequera: these 4 areas. These prerequisite opas need to understand it's already.

2861
05:17:27.240 --> 05:17:42.920
Orlando Sequera: Chances are that your organization already has a procurement strategy. For example, a Government contract Federal Government contractors already have their far a in place, their procurement strategy in place. So you need to work within those 2

2862
05:17:42.930 --> 05:17:54.869
Orlando Sequera: follow those opa and opa. Remember organizational process assets. Right? Then you also need to a understand the acquisition method. How can you?

2863
05:17:54.960 --> 05:18:05.229
Orlando Sequera: Can you contact a vendor directly, or do you have to go through a bidding process? That's what we mean by acquisition method. And then you get a check with your

2864
05:18:06.300 --> 05:18:13.830
Orlando Sequera: a procurement department and follow the procurement strategy that is already in place and take into account your a

2865
05:18:14.210 --> 05:18:16.159
Orlando Sequera: You procurement

2866
05:18:16.510 --> 05:18:20.190
Orlando Sequera: strategy for that situation, and

2867
05:18:20.490 --> 05:18:22.710
Orlando Sequera: also the contract types.

2868
05:18:23.640 --> 05:18:25.779
Orlando Sequera: You can provide suggestions

2869
05:18:26.030 --> 05:18:40.049
Orlando Sequera: to your procurement department on the best contract types. But this has the You're going to be working with mainly with 2 departments in this specific area. You're going to be working with the purchasing department or procurement department.

2870
05:18:40.070 --> 05:18:43.039
Orlando Sequera: And you're also going to be working with the legal department.

2871
05:18:43.120 --> 05:18:45.949
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we don't work in a vacuum.

2872
05:18:46.180 --> 05:18:47.680
Orlando Sequera: Your project manager.

2873
05:18:47.850 --> 05:18:54.549
Orlando Sequera: You're not. The chances are that you're not a legal expert, and you're not a procurement expert. We have to work with other departments.

2874
05:18:54.560 --> 05:19:10.820
Orlando Sequera: this specific area of procurement. You work with the procurement Department, and you're also working with the legal department. They're the ones that are going to be drafting the the contracts. They're the legal experts. So you have to work with them. You can provide some suggestions, but ultimately

2875
05:19:10.860 --> 05:19:20.279
Orlando Sequera: they're the ones that are going to be drafting the contracts. Okay, and you also have your procurement faces. Typically, when you engage a vendor

2876
05:19:20.670 --> 05:19:30.220
Orlando Sequera: regardless of the the the process for that or the acquisition method. You're gonna work with them through the fulfillment of a contract. A legally binding

2877
05:19:30.270 --> 05:19:38.280
Orlando Sequera: agreement between the 2 parties. Okay, and closure is going to be the end of the process, and there is going to be a closer

2878
05:19:38.480 --> 05:19:40.500
Orlando Sequera: procedure for

2879
05:19:40.530 --> 05:19:42.900
Orlando Sequera: for that, for closing that procurement.

2880
05:19:43.200 --> 05:19:46.920
Orlando Sequera: a you work with organization finance, as we say here

2881
05:19:47.840 --> 05:19:59.069
Orlando Sequera: in many cases you're going to be able to work with pre pre-approved vendors because organizations they event other organizations, and they make them part. They have at least of

2882
05:19:59.110 --> 05:20:09.230
Orlando Sequera: pre-approved vendors in in place that you can review and that's that's going to facilitate the process because they have been already vetted.

2883
05:20:10.210 --> 05:20:12.190
Orlando Sequera: Also a

2884
05:20:12.290 --> 05:20:26.580
Orlando Sequera: do. In many cases you're gonna have to go through a bidding process, meaning that you have to reach out to potential vendors with a procurement. What you're trying to procure, give them the chance to come up with biddings and

2885
05:20:26.590 --> 05:20:40.430
Orlando Sequera: have big vendor conferences, address their questions and then go through an entire process to select the best option that happens with different levels of government all the time they go through a bidding process.

2886
05:20:40.510 --> 05:20:45.050
Orlando Sequera: You can you can. You also have to define

2887
05:20:45.210 --> 05:20:47.899
Orlando Sequera: the escalation procedures. Whenever

2888
05:20:48.820 --> 05:20:56.629
Orlando Sequera: changes in significant changes to these contracts are going to be implemented, there has to be an escalation procedure, and then

2889
05:20:57.280 --> 05:20:58.430
Orlando Sequera: you should

2890
05:20:58.630 --> 05:21:02.470
Orlando Sequera: pay the contracts. What? As per the contract, as

2891
05:21:02.560 --> 05:21:14.880
Orlando Sequera: the payments shouldn't be made at the end of the project, necessarily they should be made when it based on the contract terms. Okay, do you have to follow that if your contract

2892
05:21:14.900 --> 05:21:29.399
Orlando Sequera: a with a vendor says that you have to pay them when they complete a particular, they hit a particular master, then do it. At that time you don't have to wait until the entire project is completed, otherwise will be a violation of that particular contract.

2893
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:33.960
Orlando Sequera: Okay, but that has to be defined. That's what we need to have

2894
05:21:34.340 --> 05:21:35.210
Orlando Sequera: a

2895
05:21:36.500 --> 05:21:51.629
Orlando Sequera: procurement management plan in place, this procurement management plan. These are the rules that we're going to have in place for procurement. It's going to cover. What type of contract that we're going to be using? What are the process for evaluating bits?

2896
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:54.499
Orlando Sequera: What are the standard procurement documents.

2897
05:21:54.610 --> 05:22:01.280
Orlando Sequera: documents that we're going to be using? And how are we going to manage our

2898
05:22:01.480 --> 05:22:06.749
Orlando Sequera: vendors or providers? Okay, you're going to be working with

2899
05:22:06.850 --> 05:22:21.160
Orlando Sequera: the procurement department of your organization, and i'm gonna add that you're gonna also gonna be working with the legal department of your organization when it comes to procurement. So at least 2 departments that you're working with procurement and

2900
05:22:21.240 --> 05:22:22.770
Orlando Sequera: legal all right

2901
05:22:24.790 --> 05:22:25.760
Orlando Sequera: also.

2902
05:22:26.590 --> 05:22:30.670
Orlando Sequera: These are some examples of procurement. The

2903
05:22:30.790 --> 05:22:31.910
Orlando Sequera: we have

2904
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:34.510
Orlando Sequera: a statement of work

2905
05:22:34.700 --> 05:22:44.190
Orlando Sequera: that is a formal document that describes the require goods or services that you are trying to procure with enough detail

2906
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:52.259
Orlando Sequera: that is going to allow prospective vendors or sellers or providers to determine whether they can provide

2907
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:54.980
Orlando Sequera: what you're trying to procure or not.

2908
05:22:55.330 --> 05:23:01.830
Orlando Sequera: they should be sent to all the potential vendors so they can then evaluate their capabilities.

2909
05:23:01.950 --> 05:23:12.069
Orlando Sequera: This is also a basis to develop the procurement documentation during solicitation and should be created from this the project scope baseline.

2910
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:18.430
Orlando Sequera: right? We use the process of baseline as an input in order to create your statement of work.

2911
05:23:18.900 --> 05:23:22.329
Orlando Sequera: A. But additionally my apologies.

2912
05:23:26.350 --> 05:23:27.310
Here we go.

2913
05:23:28.210 --> 05:23:30.990
Orlando Sequera: Additionally. You can have

2914
05:23:31.790 --> 05:23:37.709
Orlando Sequera: what is called an Rfq. Which is a request for quotation, so they can submit. Quote

2915
05:23:38.220 --> 05:23:39.470
Orlando Sequera: A.

2916
05:23:39.880 --> 05:23:47.080
Orlando Sequera: This document has multiple names. It can call it can be called a bit or tender, or quote.

2917
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:49.000
Orlando Sequera: They do not

2918
05:23:49.180 --> 05:23:53.489
Orlando Sequera: constitute an agreement, but they allow the buyer to

2919
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:59.109
Orlando Sequera: determine whether a which response is going to be a made, the request that needs

2920
05:23:59.390 --> 05:24:06.470
Orlando Sequera: you can also use what is called an ifb, which is a invitation for bit, and this is where they buyer

2921
05:24:06.490 --> 05:24:17.510
Orlando Sequera: request themselves. The buyer itself request They show expression of interest in working with you. A. and, by the way.

2922
05:24:17.530 --> 05:24:28.410
Orlando Sequera: one thing that I forgot to mention is that when it comes to procurement you are the buying organization. You have to look at it from that perspective. You are the buying organization, and you are

2923
05:24:28.940 --> 05:24:36.490
Orlando Sequera: for curing. The vendors are the third-party organization. So you gotta look at it from that perspective. You are the buyer. They are the vendor.

2924
05:24:36.700 --> 05:24:40.780
Orlando Sequera: Okay? And then you also have other type of procurement documentation.

2925
05:24:40.830 --> 05:24:42.989
Orlando Sequera: a request Rfps

2926
05:24:43.120 --> 05:24:54.019
Orlando Sequera: that is commonly used a. And also in some other industries. They use expression of interest. I'm. Honestly most familiar with statement of work, and

2927
05:24:54.720 --> 05:24:57.490
Orlando Sequera: Rfqs and R Ofps

2928
05:24:58.030 --> 05:25:03.209
Orlando Sequera: request for proposal. Okay, but these are some examples of a

2929
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:06.090
Orlando Sequera: procurement documentation.

2930
05:25:08.300 --> 05:25:14.519
Orlando Sequera: One way to attract a top talent is to ask vendors to complete the work.

2931
05:25:14.680 --> 05:25:19.250
Orlando Sequera: Once once you've been able to give them a clear understanding of the procurement requirements

2932
05:25:19.540 --> 05:25:32.339
Orlando Sequera: A. And the terms and conditions the beaters can prepare a competitive bit to provide the service. That's what happens with government contracts all the time with not only NASA, but other feather

2933
05:25:32.360 --> 05:25:41.729
Orlando Sequera: for the government agencies like NASA, they and that happens at multiple levels of covering. I'm sure is the same in your prospective countries.

2934
05:25:42.040 --> 05:25:46.710
Orlando Sequera: but that's pretty much how it gets done. So they go through all these.

2935
05:25:47.610 --> 05:25:49.310
Orlando Sequera: They go through these

2936
05:25:49.570 --> 05:26:03.599
Orlando Sequera: through these processes, and these allows organizations to that are publicly funded or highly regulated use form of processes to procure goods and services like the ones that are working with different levels of government.

2937
05:26:04.290 --> 05:26:06.010
Orlando Sequera: this really helps.

2938
05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:16.029
Orlando Sequera: and or, as I said, with organizations, they're working in. Industries are highly regulated, like, for example, airspace.

2939
05:26:16.120 --> 05:26:18.219
Orlando Sequera: Or if the project needs

2940
05:26:18.340 --> 05:26:21.890
Orlando Sequera: specialist work, they want to find the best quality available.

2941
05:26:22.650 --> 05:26:39.629
Orlando Sequera: They use these Rfp and bitter conferences as a formal process to make sure that all the prospective vendors have a clear understanding of the procurement. But again, you work closely with the procurement department.

2942
05:26:45.550 --> 05:26:54.970
Orlando Sequera: You also have to have a criteria in place to select those possible vendors or those possible

2943
05:26:55.930 --> 05:26:57.360
Orlando Sequera: those possible

2944
05:26:58.220 --> 05:27:10.029
Orlando Sequera: sellers. You gotta have a criteria. What are you going to evaluate them? A. What is the criteria you're going to use to evaluate those possible vendors. That's what we mean by source, selection, criteria.

2945
05:27:10.230 --> 05:27:15.389
Orlando Sequera: These are some examples. Not necessarily. These are the most common ones. So

2946
05:27:15.540 --> 05:27:21.570
Orlando Sequera: what we're going to evaluate them, based on their understanding of the need. Where we're trying to procure

2947
05:27:21.630 --> 05:27:32.139
Orlando Sequera: technical capability. What is the warranty that they offer? What is their financial capacity? Do they have any proprietary rights or intellectual property, right?

2948
05:27:32.160 --> 05:27:34.470
Orlando Sequera: Past performance as sellers.

2949
05:27:34.520 --> 05:27:36.519
Orlando Sequera: business size and type.

2950
05:27:36.570 --> 05:27:45.870
Orlando Sequera: a production, capacity and interest management approach technical approach, etc. So that is a criteria that you're going to use to select your vendors

2951
05:27:48.200 --> 05:27:49.750
Orlando Sequera: Once you

2952
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:52.810
Orlando Sequera: once they are selected.

2953
05:27:53.940 --> 05:27:55.420
Orlando Sequera: they they become.

2954
05:27:55.800 --> 05:27:58.320
Orlando Sequera: we call a qualified vendor.

2955
05:27:59.140 --> 05:28:00.560
Orlando Sequera: Okay, but

2956
05:28:00.660 --> 05:28:14.790
Orlando Sequera: most organizations they have at least the pre-approved vendors, and they are also qualified. And this is something that we have to a to review first to look over the list of quality pre-approved vendors or qualify vendors.

2957
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:18.050
Orlando Sequera: They work with the organization in the past.

2958
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:21.639
Orlando Sequera: and they organizations procurement departments

2959
05:28:21.650 --> 05:28:38.330
Orlando Sequera: they like to use qualified vendors because their their accounts are already set up. That process is already in place, so they don't have to go through this vetting process that a new organization or a new vendor has to go through so ideally they will like to go through

2960
05:28:38.340 --> 05:28:41.680
Orlando Sequera: using qualified vendors as much as possible.

2961
05:28:43.240 --> 05:28:44.310
Orlando Sequera: Then

2962
05:28:44.650 --> 05:28:46.020
Orlando Sequera: the contracts.

2963
05:28:47.360 --> 05:28:49.669
Orlando Sequera: Here we're going to be working.

2964
05:28:49.700 --> 05:28:53.740
Orlando Sequera: We need legally binding agreements to work with our

2965
05:28:54.460 --> 05:29:00.730
Orlando Sequera: A with our vendors right to a country legally binding document that

2966
05:29:00.750 --> 05:29:19.360
Orlando Sequera: obligates both parties to meet the terms that are specified in that contract. We work with the legal department. We're not going to be drafting this contract on our own. Okay, that's not how it gets done. You're going to be working with procurement and you're also going to be working with the legal department. Okay,

2967
05:29:20.250 --> 05:29:30.169
Orlando Sequera: Right now, it is important that the type of contract that you negotiate with a seller can influence the tone and the reality of that good relationship.

2968
05:29:30.900 --> 05:29:34.480
Orlando Sequera: Ideally, this contract should be negotiated in good faith

2969
05:29:35.070 --> 05:29:37.940
Orlando Sequera: towards creating a positive working relationship.

2970
05:29:37.980 --> 05:29:39.600
Orlando Sequera: Okay, that is crucial.

2971
05:29:39.640 --> 05:29:47.279
Orlando Sequera: the contracts are going to legalize those working agreements with this third-party organization. They're going to give this structure

2972
05:29:47.370 --> 05:29:49.330
Orlando Sequera: to those working relationships.

2973
05:29:49.360 --> 05:30:01.189
Orlando Sequera: They're going to help us in furthering collaboration. They're going to take it is important to take into account the risks associated with the different contract types which we're going to cover briefly in in a minute.

2974
05:30:01.450 --> 05:30:09.789
Orlando Sequera: And the goal is to deliver benefits to the buyer. That will be you. Your You're representing the buy an organization, and they can be tailored

2975
05:30:09.960 --> 05:30:17.570
Orlando Sequera: for the partnership, and this is pretty much the life cycle of a contract. So you you understand with

2976
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:21.789
Orlando Sequera: they understand, you understand, with the termination, the determination of the need.

2977
05:30:22.610 --> 05:30:24.090
Orlando Sequera: then the request.

2978
05:30:24.250 --> 05:30:28.860
Orlando Sequera: then the proposal is put together, and finally the contract is put together.

2979
05:30:30.100 --> 05:30:31.939
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to contracts

2980
05:30:33.420 --> 05:30:36.329
Orlando Sequera: we have mainly 3 types.

2981
05:30:37.120 --> 05:30:38.940
Orlando Sequera: The first one is.

2982
05:30:41.820 --> 05:30:44.919
Orlando Sequera: we're going to start with costs reversible

2983
05:30:46.020 --> 05:30:51.259
Orlando Sequera: in cost-reversible contracts. That is a contract in which

2984
05:30:51.340 --> 05:30:59.769
Orlando Sequera: the seller is gonna be. Remember, the seller is the third party you are the buyer. The seller is going to be reimburse for all the cost to loss

2985
05:30:59.950 --> 05:31:08.189
Orlando Sequera: a fee, and that fee is usually going to be the profit. So they're going to be reverse for all the eliable costs

2986
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:09.720
Orlando Sequera: and all those

2987
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:12.250
Orlando Sequera: costs are going to be specified in the contract.

2988
05:31:12.290 --> 05:31:13.140
Orlando Sequera: And then.

2989
05:31:13.280 --> 05:31:17.819
Orlando Sequera: on top of that they're gonna get a fee. That's what we mean by cost reversible.

2990
05:31:18.190 --> 05:31:24.280
Orlando Sequera: This works well for situations in which we're working with significant scope changes.

2991
05:31:24.300 --> 05:31:24.970
Okay.

2992
05:31:25.120 --> 05:31:28.560
Orlando Sequera: and coast reimbursement has 3 flavors.

2993
05:31:28.590 --> 05:31:29.690
Orlando Sequera: We have

2994
05:31:29.820 --> 05:31:32.649
Orlando Sequera: what we call cost for a fixed fee.

2995
05:31:33.890 --> 05:31:39.280
Orlando Sequera: That's where the seller is reimbursed for all the allowable costs

2996
05:31:39.440 --> 05:31:40.809
Orlando Sequera: plus a fee.

2997
05:31:40.830 --> 05:31:47.310
Orlando Sequera: and this fee doesn't change unless the scope of the work changes. Okay, the fee is going to be the same.

2998
05:31:47.380 --> 05:31:48.440
Orlando Sequera: A.

2999
05:31:48.510 --> 05:31:49.570
Orlando Sequera: They're going to get.

3000
05:31:49.760 --> 05:31:50.980
Orlando Sequera: They're going to be

3001
05:31:51.030 --> 05:32:00.549
Orlando Sequera: for their cost, and then they're going to be They fee they're going to get a a specific feed that's not going to change unless discover the work changes.

3002
05:32:00.610 --> 05:32:04.230
Orlando Sequera: The next one is what we call cost plus incentive fee.

3003
05:32:04.420 --> 05:32:06.620
Orlando Sequera: Here is where

3004
05:32:06.690 --> 05:32:09.430
Orlando Sequera: the sailor is going to be reversed for all the cost.

3005
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:10.330
Orlando Sequera: what

3006
05:32:10.540 --> 05:32:11.980
Orlando Sequera: they are going to get

3007
05:32:12.570 --> 05:32:17.240
Orlando Sequera: a an incentive if they hit performance objectives. So.

3008
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:24.250
Orlando Sequera: for example, if the costs are less or greater than the originally estimated cost. They can get

3009
05:32:24.530 --> 05:32:28.769
Orlando Sequera: They can get a performance inceptive. They can get an additional fee.

3010
05:32:28.970 --> 05:32:46.230
Orlando Sequera: or, if they need or exceed, for example, they they they deliver early, and this delivering early is going to be specified in the contract. Right? They're going to get an incentive fee on top of the fee that they were that they were originally going to to receive.

3011
05:32:46.240 --> 05:33:04.429
Orlando Sequera: or, if they exceed, a quality, objectives, a lower number of defects compared to what was specified in the contract. For example, if they meet those that that criteria that is very well specified in the contract, they can get an incentive on top of their

3012
05:33:04.440 --> 05:33:06.519
Orlando Sequera: the fee that we're going to get for their profit.

3013
05:33:06.660 --> 05:33:10.200
Orlando Sequera: and the last one is cost, plus a worthy.

3014
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:20.979
Orlando Sequera: and this is widely used in the in the government sectors. The sellers are going to be reimbursed for all their costs, but then

3015
05:33:21.310 --> 05:33:30.950
Orlando Sequera: they are going to get an award based on subjective performance criteria. The government loves to using this type of contract.

3016
05:33:30.970 --> 05:33:38.410
Orlando Sequera: If they go above and beyond, for example, it's a little bit more specific than that. But if they.

3017
05:33:38.420 --> 05:33:57.380
Orlando Sequera: if if they made if they did a great job, something along those lines, something that is the subjective of what do you mean going up over and beyond what you mean by if they meet all, if they went above and beyond, if they achieve a high level of satisfaction with a customer. So it's really more subjective.

3018
05:33:57.460 --> 05:33:58.310
Orlando Sequera: But

3019
05:33:58.430 --> 05:34:05.620
Orlando Sequera: a it is one type of contract the government. They like to use a lot of cost, plus a worthy.

3020
05:34:05.720 --> 05:34:23.450
Orlando Sequera: So organizations that are working in. For example, in the other Miss program. That's the type of contract that they sign with NASA. Normally it's right, and it's very subjective, and he's. They buy an organization. They're the ones that the that

3021
05:34:23.460 --> 05:34:26.760
Orlando Sequera: create that criteria. So that is one type.

3022
05:34:26.880 --> 05:34:30.760
Orlando Sequera: Then we also have another type of contract that is called

3023
05:34:31.710 --> 05:34:32.960
Orlando Sequera: Fixed price

3024
05:34:34.590 --> 05:34:35.820
Orlando Sequera: Fixed price.

3025
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:39.999
Orlando Sequera: This works really well for situations in which

3026
05:34:40.360 --> 05:34:42.559
Orlando Sequera: the scope is well-defined.

3027
05:34:42.790 --> 05:34:45.380
Orlando Sequera: This is widely used in construction.

3028
05:34:45.490 --> 05:34:54.279
Orlando Sequera: This copies, well understood, well-defined, and no significant changes are expected. Your best bet to go with a fixed price type of contract.

3029
05:34:55.510 --> 05:34:57.330
Orlando Sequera: They, the we have

3030
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:58.880
Orlando Sequera: 3 flavors

3031
05:34:58.950 --> 05:35:02.730
Orlando Sequera: for fixed price. The first one is firm, fixed price.

3032
05:35:02.860 --> 05:35:06.660
Orlando Sequera: The prices of of the goods are going to be set at the beginning, and

3033
05:35:06.810 --> 05:35:14.670
Orlando Sequera: that's not going to change unless the scope changes. It's a fixed price. This is what we're going to pay for that, and it's not going to change unless the scope changes

3034
05:35:14.940 --> 05:35:17.409
Orlando Sequera: fixed price with incentive fee

3035
05:35:17.970 --> 05:35:19.010
Orlando Sequera: that gave.

3036
05:35:19.140 --> 05:35:32.020
Orlando Sequera: They buy on the center a little bit of flexibility, and he takes into account some deviation from performance, and he said, Surprise, ceiling. But if there are changes in the costs.

3037
05:35:32.070 --> 05:35:47.120
Orlando Sequera: and they set a price sailing, and anything beyond that is going to be charged to the seller, for here would they have a little bit more flexibility compared to the firm, fixed price, and then they have another type of contract, which is

3038
05:35:48.050 --> 05:35:57.840
Orlando Sequera: used in also in some even in some government, or in some long term company. Long term projects.

3039
05:35:57.850 --> 05:36:10.290
Orlando Sequera: for example, can spend 2025 years, 30 years, just to give an idea, and especially when they use commodities like oil. They use a fixed price with economic price adjustment to protect

3040
05:36:10.300 --> 05:36:28.929
Orlando Sequera: both the seller and the buyer from fluctuations in those commodities, for example, old prices. There's always a fluctuation that goes up, and it goes down so to to protect, and both the buyer and the seller the over time they a. This is widely used.

3041
05:36:28.940 --> 05:36:31.639
Orlando Sequera: They fixed price with the economic price adjustment

3042
05:36:31.840 --> 05:36:37.440
Orlando Sequera: pre up for vendors or Internet international payments. In many cases it's used in that fashion.

3043
05:36:37.460 --> 05:36:41.190
Orlando Sequera: Okay? And then the third type that we have is

3044
05:36:42.320 --> 05:36:43.380
Orlando Sequera: a hybrid.

3045
05:36:43.880 --> 05:36:45.240
Orlando Sequera: It's

3046
05:36:45.720 --> 05:36:48.190
Orlando Sequera: it's what we call a combination of the 2.

3047
05:36:48.270 --> 05:36:50.130
Orlando Sequera: It's a combination. It has

3048
05:36:50.320 --> 05:36:57.960
Orlando Sequera: aspects of fixed price, and it also has aspects of cost, reimbursement.

3049
05:36:59.610 --> 05:37:08.119
Orlando Sequera: The classic example to understand that time and materials contract is when we hire consultants or contractors to work on our project.

3050
05:37:08.680 --> 05:37:14.000
Orlando Sequera: That's the classic example. Why is that because in some cases we it has

3051
05:37:14.720 --> 05:37:16.010
Orlando Sequera: a fixed price

3052
05:37:16.570 --> 05:37:32.559
Orlando Sequera: aspect, because we're going to be able to set the hourly rate that we're going to pay to those contractors. Let's assume that it's $50 an hour or $80 an hour. But then the number of hours that we're gonna have to. That is a little bit more that that

3053
05:37:32.570 --> 05:37:45.570
Orlando Sequera: we we use a a cost reversible approach. It depends on how many hours we need them for. Okay, so that will be an example of time and materials. It's a combination of fixed price and time and materials

3054
05:37:46.140 --> 05:37:50.019
Orlando Sequera: for agile. We also have some contracts. We have

3055
05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:56.120
Orlando Sequera: a multiple types of contracts. We also have fixed price with increments.

3056
05:37:56.140 --> 05:38:06.279
Orlando Sequera: We have multi-tiered a multi-tier structure they provide flexibility in categorizing content in different documents.

3057
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:19.010
Orlando Sequera: They emphasize value delivered the type of contract that's about incremental value and delivery milestones delivery. In mastons of face gates we have fixed price increments.

3058
05:38:19.050 --> 05:38:26.239
Orlando Sequera: They basically we break down the scope into smaller fixed price or budgeted pieces.

3059
05:38:26.300 --> 05:38:38.240
Orlando Sequera: We also have not to exceed time and material. That's a very common one in agile, in which we set a lead ceiling for both this the budget and the schedule

3060
05:38:38.740 --> 05:38:45.589
Orlando Sequera: A. We also have a graduated time and materials that shares the financial risk

3061
05:38:45.820 --> 05:38:52.070
Orlando Sequera: with the contracting organization. We also have an early cancellation option

3062
05:38:52.260 --> 05:38:58.160
Orlando Sequera: that enables a flexible to deliver a of scope using the definition of done.

3063
05:38:59.330 --> 05:39:03.149
Orlando Sequera: and we also have a dynamic scope option

3064
05:39:03.660 --> 05:39:14.359
Orlando Sequera: that gives the option to various scope and fund innovation as specific points. And we also have team augmentation that focuses on collaboration.

3065
05:39:14.560 --> 05:39:17.179
Orlando Sequera: A. To enable flexible scope

3066
05:39:17.220 --> 05:39:21.920
Orlando Sequera: so multiple aspects when it comes to agile contract types.

3067
05:39:22.440 --> 05:39:28.410
Orlando Sequera: and regardless of the approach, what are the components that we have with our contracts.

3068
05:39:31.360 --> 05:39:36.480
Orlando Sequera: The contracts are going to cover the description of the work. What are the deliberables that need to be

3069
05:39:36.910 --> 05:39:44.140
Orlando Sequera: produced by the contracting organization and the scope. It's going to have a delivery date and schedule information.

3070
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:46.979
Orlando Sequera: It's going to identify the authority.

3071
05:39:47.560 --> 05:39:52.600
Orlando Sequera: Their responsibilities for both parties are going to be clearly specified in the contract.

3072
05:39:52.940 --> 05:39:56.579
Orlando Sequera: They're going to allow us to manage technical and business aspects.

3073
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:59.309
Orlando Sequera: payment, information, payment, terms.

3074
05:39:59.520 --> 05:40:03.549
Orlando Sequera: probations for terminations of these contracts.

3075
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:05.850
Orlando Sequera: any guarantees and warranties.

3076
05:40:05.980 --> 05:40:14.209
Orlando Sequera: intellectual property, considerations, security, confidentiality, and data privacy. That's commonly what we find in this

3077
05:40:14.250 --> 05:40:15.579
Orlando Sequera: a contract.

3078
05:40:18.770 --> 05:40:29.660
Orlando Sequera: and that takes us to a summary. This is what we have been covering, how it relates to the exam Content outline. We went over project resource requirements, and

3079
05:40:29.700 --> 05:40:31.310
Orlando Sequera: we talked about

3080
05:40:32.100 --> 05:40:40.579
Orlando Sequera: plan and managing procurement, including the final resource. Requirements communicate research requirements, managing suppliers and contracts.

3081
05:40:40.840 --> 05:40:46.149
Orlando Sequera: management of the procurement strategy and developing a delivery solution.

3082
05:40:46.890 --> 05:40:50.780
Orlando Sequera: And the next topic that we're going to be covering is

3083
05:40:51.630 --> 05:40:54.190
Orlando Sequera: budget. Now we're going to talk about budget.

3084
05:40:54.770 --> 05:41:02.790
Orlando Sequera: So we have our schedule. We went over our scope. We went over a scheduled. We went over our a procurement.

3085
05:41:02.900 --> 05:41:06.610
Orlando Sequera: We cover the contracts, the different types of contracts.

3086
05:41:07.460 --> 05:41:12.829
Orlando Sequera: We also talked about resources. And now we are going to talk about

3087
05:41:13.130 --> 05:41:24.930
Orlando Sequera: our budget. One of the major, One of the major constraints of any project, one of the important areas. So this is part of what is known as the triple constraint.

3088
05:41:25.320 --> 05:41:28.989
Orlando Sequera: Okay, this is where we're going to determine.

3089
05:41:29.760 --> 05:41:31.900
Orlando Sequera: The project project that is needed

3090
05:41:32.250 --> 05:41:35.160
Orlando Sequera: in order to complete project activities.

3091
05:41:35.200 --> 05:41:35.850
Okay.

3092
05:41:38.470 --> 05:41:54.819
Orlando Sequera: You might be wondering. Are you going to be aligning the budget with the scope and scheduled requirements in a predicted life cycle? Yes, if you're following up to like cycle. That's exactly what you're going to be doing. Or are you going to be collaborating with partners and internal finance stakeholders to craft a suitable financial solution

3093
05:41:55.080 --> 05:42:00.470
Orlando Sequera: as the agile mindset proposes. The answer is, Yes, if you're following an agile approach.

3094
05:42:00.530 --> 05:42:06.770
Orlando Sequera: so it's a it's pretty much a combination of both when it comes to budget planning.

3095
05:42:07.010 --> 05:42:08.809
Orlando Sequera: It is

3096
05:42:09.280 --> 05:42:11.460
Orlando Sequera: important to take into account

3097
05:42:12.430 --> 05:42:15.579
Orlando Sequera: the cost and the value right?

3098
05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:20.259
Orlando Sequera: And also remember that organization of stakeholder attitudes. They change.

3099
05:42:20.520 --> 05:42:38.319
Orlando Sequera: They, what are what are their added to stores and budget and costs? You need to understand that's part of the organizational culture need to understand what is the driving factor. What is the most important constraint for the organization? Is it scheduled? It's a time, or is it cost it's a budget, or is it

3100
05:42:38.460 --> 05:42:40.760
Orlando Sequera: scope. So you need to understand that

3101
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:45.409
Orlando Sequera: e when it comes to creating the budget.

3102
05:42:46.990 --> 05:42:49.799
Orlando Sequera: This has to be in accordance with the project life cycle.

3103
05:42:50.400 --> 05:42:53.029
Orlando Sequera: If we're following a predictive approach.

3104
05:42:53.110 --> 05:42:57.409
Orlando Sequera: Ideally, the budget is gonna set during project planning.

3105
05:42:57.530 --> 05:43:15.100
Orlando Sequera: Early in the project we create the pro, the the do. We establish a project with the project with the budget with the baseline. The cost baseline, by the way, the cost baseline, and that's only going to change through change control process. Okay, but

3106
05:43:15.770 --> 05:43:20.740
Orlando Sequera: For hybrid approaches, we ask, we have

3107
05:43:21.100 --> 05:43:39.499
Orlando Sequera: adaptability around a. We have to be a adaptable. It's incorporating that aspect from agile and then with agile. If we're following an adaptive approach, it's a little bit different. We have to work. We have. We have to collaborate with our stakeholders to understand a

3108
05:43:40.290 --> 05:43:43.520
Orlando Sequera: to have basically an open mind when it comes to.

3109
05:43:44.140 --> 05:44:03.569
Orlando Sequera: They bought it in approach, depending on the scope. And this the the scope that the team is trying to produce with the project. So we have to work. It's not going to be fixed at the beginning of the project. It's not going to be a creative at the beginning of the project, like we do with predictive, we need to understand, collaborate with our stakeholders

3110
05:44:03.580 --> 05:44:15.419
Orlando Sequera: well based on this features that we're building. We are going to suggest an incremental budgeting approach that allows the team to produce the features that are needed.

3111
05:44:15.490 --> 05:44:23.720
Orlando Sequera: and with a hybrid approach you need a little bit more flexibility than you have with predictive. That's what we're trying to say here.

3112
05:44:24.460 --> 05:44:27.270
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to predictive planning.

3113
05:44:29.100 --> 05:44:37.929
Orlando Sequera: you have to start by creating a cost management plan. These are the rules are you going to follow for your cost in your project

3114
05:44:39.300 --> 05:44:50.690
Orlando Sequera: establishes? What currency are you going to be using. How are you going to track performance? A. Basically, all the rules? The same principle that we use for every single other area of our project.

3115
05:44:50.920 --> 05:44:56.120
Orlando Sequera: We have to also use estimating techniques. We need to estimate in this case, not

3116
05:44:56.380 --> 05:45:02.080
Orlando Sequera: duration. We're going to be estimating the costs associated with activities. We have to be able to

3117
05:45:02.770 --> 05:45:22.439
Orlando Sequera: develop a cost baseline. This is the approved version of the cost of our project that is only going to be changing through change control process. So we create another basin. This is the third one that we're mentioned. We have a scope, baseline. We have a scheduled baseline, and we have a cost. Baseline. This is all for predictive. Okay?

3118
05:45:22.870 --> 05:45:26.400
Orlando Sequera: And this is where we're going to have some

3119
05:45:26.700 --> 05:45:28.420
Orlando Sequera: project contingency

3120
05:45:28.660 --> 05:45:32.480
Orlando Sequera: press, Any identified risks. This is how we can address those

3121
05:45:32.970 --> 05:45:43.729
Orlando Sequera: a uncertainty that may or may not happen in the future. Those buffers of some of you were mentioning. This is how we address that those project contingencies are what we call reserves.

3122
05:45:44.090 --> 05:45:48.350
Orlando Sequera: And again, the cost baseline can only change through

3123
05:45:48.430 --> 05:45:50.170
Orlando Sequera: change control process.

3124
05:45:50.600 --> 05:46:00.040
Orlando Sequera: and what we create is, and this is something that I want you to remember when it comes to our value management. The project budget is also known as

3125
05:46:00.970 --> 05:46:12.410
Orlando Sequera: the bac or budget at completion. Whenever you see we're covering a and value management whenever you see Bac. That is the budget of completion that equals

3126
05:46:12.460 --> 05:46:14.370
Orlando Sequera: overall Project Budget.

3127
05:46:15.010 --> 05:46:15.890
Okay.

3128
05:46:16.890 --> 05:46:17.840
Orlando Sequera: And

3129
05:46:20.200 --> 05:46:27.530
Orlando Sequera: one aspect that we have to keep in mind. This is a great graphic because it allows us to understand multiple things.

3130
05:46:28.560 --> 05:46:30.239
Orlando Sequera: This is our

3131
05:46:31.490 --> 05:46:33.200
Orlando Sequera: What did I completion?

3132
05:46:33.290 --> 05:46:35.970
Orlando Sequera: There is a

3133
05:46:37.140 --> 05:46:44.049
Orlando Sequera: a couple of things that we have to take into account the funding requirements. Nobody gets in any project. A blind check

3134
05:46:44.470 --> 05:46:50.210
Orlando Sequera: for let's. Let's assume the estimate of the overall budget for for our project is 1 million dollars.

3135
05:46:50.740 --> 05:47:05.619
Orlando Sequera: Organizations are not gonna give you. Here you go, Mr. Orlando. You have a 1 million dollars to work on your project. Go ahead and and and spend it. That's not how it works. We're gonna get that in steps when we need we have to plan to make sure that's why we use

3136
05:47:06.010 --> 05:47:17.660
Orlando Sequera: our milestones, and the funding requirements are going to come in steps. That's what you see. This here. This resembles a ladder. These are the steps that when you're going to be getting your

3137
05:47:18.390 --> 05:47:24.060
Orlando Sequera: your funding requirements, I need you to make sure that they're available when they need to be available to make the payments

3138
05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:25.170
Orlando Sequera: a

3139
05:47:25.540 --> 05:47:29.209
Orlando Sequera: but one aspect here. When you're trying to determine.

3140
05:47:29.230 --> 05:47:37.250
Orlando Sequera: you're aggregating your cost of your activities, and you're also taking into account contingency reserves

3141
05:47:37.320 --> 05:47:47.370
Orlando Sequera: to address any risks that we you were able to identify, because to address risks. You need money, and you need time. So that's what we call contingency reserve.

3142
05:47:47.410 --> 05:47:49.699
Orlando Sequera: All of that is part of your

3143
05:47:49.830 --> 05:48:08.200
Orlando Sequera: A pro at your cost, Baseline. But outside of your cost, baseline. You have another type of reserve that we need to have in place, which is a set amount of money, a set amount of time that we call management reserve, and that is to address any unknowns, any UN identified risks

3144
05:48:08.210 --> 05:48:23.470
Orlando Sequera: that you were not able to identify for your project Again, you need time and money. So that is what we call the management reserve as the project manager. You have no authority to use the manager and reserve you need to ask

3145
05:48:24.080 --> 05:48:25.280
Orlando Sequera: for

3146
05:48:26.040 --> 05:48:32.159
Orlando Sequera: it. You need to ask for for permission in order to use the management reserves, but in order to use

3147
05:48:32.290 --> 05:48:40.420
Orlando Sequera: a contingency reserve, you can do it. You don't have to ask for permission. You can go ahead and use them. If a race materializes.

3148
05:48:40.510 --> 05:48:41.320
Okay.

3149
05:48:41.770 --> 05:48:43.010
Orlando Sequera: A.

3150
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:48.850
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to developing your

3151
05:48:48.910 --> 05:48:52.489
Orlando Sequera: budget. You have to start with what's known.

3152
05:48:52.720 --> 05:48:56.200
Orlando Sequera: A check lessons learned from other projects

3153
05:48:57.180 --> 05:49:11.050
Orlando Sequera: check data from other projects that are similar, so you can have a starting point. That's why we compile lessons, learn, so we can go back and check those lessons from those projects that is really important. That is really key

3154
05:49:11.220 --> 05:49:13.499
Orlando Sequera: a look for a

3155
05:49:13.700 --> 05:49:22.359
Orlando Sequera: cost, estimating information, pitfalls that they had in the past, or successes that they had in the past. And then you have to estimate using

3156
05:49:22.600 --> 05:49:31.930
Orlando Sequera: the estimating techniques we use analogous to the estimation technique you can. You can use parametric estimation techniques. You can use a a also.

3157
05:49:34.260 --> 05:49:35.940
Orlando Sequera: You you can use per.

3158
05:49:36.510 --> 05:49:44.309
Orlando Sequera: and you can use bottom up for in. But in this case it's not the duration you can. You can use bottom up estimated for the cost

3159
05:49:48.410 --> 05:49:50.890
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to resource, costs

3160
05:49:51.280 --> 05:49:55.139
Orlando Sequera: a do you have? If you're following a predictive approach.

3161
05:49:55.240 --> 05:49:57.100
Orlando Sequera: you have to match the need.

3162
05:49:57.260 --> 05:50:00.690
Orlando Sequera: The project need to the resource attributes.

3163
05:50:00.920 --> 05:50:08.010
Orlando Sequera: And this is where we create an initial estimate based on average, and we change that estimate.

3164
05:50:08.060 --> 05:50:09.149
Orlando Sequera: I need it.

3165
05:50:09.320 --> 05:50:15.850
Orlando Sequera: If we follow an operative approach. We, if we're following a hybrid approach, we are going to assign a blended rate.

3166
05:50:15.870 --> 05:50:20.539
Orlando Sequera: and remember that we do. The estimation in agile is a little bit different.

3167
05:50:21.580 --> 05:50:34.569
Orlando Sequera: We estimate the level of complexity, not duration, and not cost, so we use it. It's a little bit different the way we the way we do it in agile. But in order to estimate the budget

3168
05:50:34.850 --> 05:50:36.000
Orlando Sequera: we have

3169
05:50:36.060 --> 05:50:52.289
Orlando Sequera: a simple formula is the cost per user story point times, the total point of value. Total point value of that are going to be completed, plus all our expenses. That's how we can forecast the budget that is needed.

3170
05:50:52.620 --> 05:50:54.559
Orlando Sequera: Okay, for our job project.

3171
05:50:55.340 --> 05:50:58.640
Orlando Sequera: When it comes to estimating the cost

3172
05:51:01.620 --> 05:51:05.380
Orlando Sequera: we in predictive, we estimate the cost

3173
05:51:05.730 --> 05:51:07.490
Orlando Sequera: at the activity level

3174
05:51:08.080 --> 05:51:08.870
Orlando Sequera: A,

3175
05:51:09.360 --> 05:51:15.980
Orlando Sequera: or we could also do it at the word package level. But we have to take into account all the costs associated with those activities.

3176
05:51:16.380 --> 05:51:23.210
Orlando Sequera: No, the labor is one of them, but we also have materials, Equipment supplies facilities, a.

3177
05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:30.450
Orlando Sequera: A. It in a considerations, and also

3178
05:51:30.810 --> 05:51:51.309
Orlando Sequera: what I mentioned before, contingency reserves. These are reserves in this specific case is a set amount of money that is going to allow us to address any risks that come to fruition in our project. Any reason that we were able to identify for our project identified risks we use continuously reserved for those

3179
05:51:52.890 --> 05:51:55.770
Orlando Sequera: at the beginning of our project. When we're estimating.

3180
05:51:56.670 --> 05:51:59.610
Orlando Sequera: we we can use an approach. That is

3181
05:51:59.800 --> 05:52:01.440
Orlando Sequera: what we call a rum.

3182
05:52:01.730 --> 05:52:11.429
Orlando Sequera: That's a ballpark estimate. It's anywhere from minus 25 to plus 75. So if it's at the beginning

3183
05:52:12.060 --> 05:52:21.960
Orlando Sequera: when we're using a wrong approach. When we say that something is costing a 100 is the they they it is like a $100,000. If we're using a rum estimate.

3184
05:52:22.080 --> 05:52:31.969
Orlando Sequera: We are saying that it's going to be anywhere between 75,000 $175,000 if we're using that

3185
05:52:32.120 --> 05:52:36.380
Orlando Sequera: if that's our level of accuracy. But we have to be able to

3186
05:52:36.440 --> 05:52:49.319
Orlando Sequera: work on increasing the level of accuracy of our estimates, and the goal should be to get to a really accurate estimate, which is a minus 5 to 2

3187
05:52:49.340 --> 05:52:53.170
Orlando Sequera: plus 10. So when we say that it's a 100,000, then

3188
05:52:53.240 --> 05:52:55.969
Orlando Sequera: what we're really saying is anywhere between

3189
05:52:56.600 --> 05:53:09.179
Orlando Sequera: 95,000 and a $110,000. That's a really accurate estimate that's a really accurate range for your estimate. Remember that an estimate is an approximation. Okay.

3190
05:53:09.420 --> 05:53:12.300
Orlando Sequera: A. And if it's an agile project.

3191
05:53:12.570 --> 05:53:21.839
Orlando Sequera: we are we expecting the scope to change? The answer is, Yes, in most cases, and we should use like what estimation methods

3192
05:53:21.980 --> 05:53:29.789
Orlando Sequera: for high level estimating, and understand that we're going to have to collaborate with stakeholders to understand those funding needs

3193
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:34.430
Orlando Sequera: when it comes to the project project

3194
05:53:36.080 --> 05:53:47.230
Orlando Sequera: the best way and the most accurate estimation technique is to use bottom up estimation because we're going to add add the activity level. We're going to work our way up.

3195
05:53:47.380 --> 05:53:50.950
Orlando Sequera: and that's how we're going to be able to determine our

3196
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:53.889
Orlando Sequera: cost baseline for the entire project.

3197
05:53:54.190 --> 05:53:55.410
Orlando Sequera: and then

3198
05:53:56.050 --> 05:53:59.399
Orlando Sequera: we can add contingency reserves

3199
05:53:59.720 --> 05:54:04.510
Orlando Sequera: that amount of money that is going to allow us to address any identified risks

3200
05:54:04.530 --> 05:54:12.139
Orlando Sequera: to our project, and if you add your project cost baseline to your contingency reserves. That is going to be your

3201
05:54:13.220 --> 05:54:14.329
Orlando Sequera: project project.

3202
05:54:14.650 --> 05:54:22.599
Orlando Sequera: But then, on top of that, you have to have also another type of reserves, which is what we call management reserves.

3203
05:54:22.650 --> 05:54:35.949
Orlando Sequera: These reserves are to address any risks that we were not able to identify for our project, and it happens, it happens when we talk about race, we're going to go over that board.

3204
05:54:36.270 --> 05:54:53.410
Orlando Sequera: We're not going to be able to identify every single possible risk for our projects. We have to be thorough with risk identification, but we have to be. We have to acknowledge the fact that not every single risk is going to be possible to identify that quick example. A global pandemic before

3205
05:54:53.420 --> 05:54:59.080
Orlando Sequera: 2020, 20. Not many organizations have that on their radar. So it happens, okay.

3206
05:55:00.490 --> 05:55:02.280
Orlando Sequera: all right and

3207
05:55:04.840 --> 05:55:08.900
Orlando Sequera: a little bit of a guidelines when it comes to budget planning for

3208
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:12.530
Orlando Sequera: for agile

3209
05:55:12.830 --> 05:55:15.199
Orlando Sequera: and they should focus on

3210
05:55:15.580 --> 05:55:20.710
Orlando Sequera: short-term budget in the metrics rather than long term, because the scope is constantly changing.

3211
05:55:20.820 --> 05:55:28.670
Orlando Sequera: They should ideally focus on having periods of work and prioritize, though that work within those time periods.

3212
05:55:28.860 --> 05:55:36.019
Orlando Sequera: and it should be based on the cost of resources that are used for that particular time period. So it's a little bit more short-term we

3213
05:55:36.100 --> 05:55:42.950
Orlando Sequera: can do it long term because the scope is going to be changing. Okay, the scope is going to be changing.

3214
05:55:45.440 --> 05:55:46.500
Orlando Sequera: Also.

3215
05:55:49.470 --> 05:55:53.230
Orlando Sequera: when we're estimating the budget based on current data.

3216
05:55:53.530 --> 05:55:56.120
Orlando Sequera: What's the forecast algorithm

3217
05:55:56.740 --> 05:56:00.520
Orlando Sequera: that is based on historical data, a expert guidance using

3218
05:56:00.650 --> 05:56:12.270
Orlando Sequera: estimate, the budget based on current data that is important. You should use a top down approach using gross, level estimation techniques, and the budget should be revised at intervals. A spring planning

3219
05:56:12.340 --> 05:56:14.239
Orlando Sequera: a enterprise. Okay.

3220
05:56:14.660 --> 05:56:15.540
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3221
05:56:18.090 --> 05:56:18.960
Orlando Sequera: And

3222
05:56:19.680 --> 05:56:26.000
Orlando Sequera: for budget considerations. We should estimate the budget based on the length of time for the project.

3223
05:56:26.380 --> 05:56:27.520
Orlando Sequera: A

3224
05:56:27.570 --> 05:56:32.299
Orlando Sequera: we have when it comes to burn rate that should include the number of team members.

3225
05:56:32.660 --> 05:56:38.149
Orlando Sequera: a blended or actual team member rate and the time of involvement. And this is for agile projects. Okay.

3226
05:56:38.240 --> 05:56:40.830
Orlando Sequera: blender, create, as we mentioned before.

3227
05:56:40.920 --> 05:56:47.149
Orlando Sequera: we should use an assumption of full time team involvement, and any additional equipment or supplies

3228
05:56:47.760 --> 05:56:51.670
Orlando Sequera: are required. Then add them to the estimated cost.

3229
05:56:51.860 --> 05:56:59.499
Orlando Sequera: The product owner. In some cases they can control the budget depending on how the team is form.

3230
05:57:00.200 --> 05:57:01.220
Orlando Sequera: Okay?

3231
05:57:01.610 --> 05:57:02.560
Orlando Sequera: And

3232
05:57:02.910 --> 05:57:04.730
Orlando Sequera: that takes us to

3233
05:57:05.220 --> 05:57:09.449
Orlando Sequera: at the summary level. We have worked on.

3234
05:57:10.220 --> 05:57:12.610
Orlando Sequera: covering the budget and resources.

3235
05:57:13.420 --> 05:57:15.640
Orlando Sequera: estimating the project, or need

3236
05:57:15.730 --> 05:57:25.269
Orlando Sequera: and anticipate future budget challenges. And then we talked about planning and managing resources. These were the exam content on topics that we cover

3237
05:57:25.420 --> 05:57:26.560
Orlando Sequera: at the end.

3238
05:57:26.820 --> 05:57:32.669
Orlando Sequera: So this is the end of the content we have come to the end of the content.

3239
05:57:32.710 --> 05:57:36.790
Orlando Sequera: And now i'm going to take, we still have a few minutes are going to take those

3240
05:57:36.910 --> 05:57:42.619
Orlando Sequera: a minutes to address the questions that we have in the chat as much as possible.

3241
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:44.080
Okay.

3242
05:57:44.320 --> 05:57:45.150
Orlando Sequera: so

3243
05:57:48.950 --> 05:57:51.010
Orlando Sequera: there's a question in the chat.

3244
05:57:51.270 --> 05:57:53.669
Orlando Sequera: I'm. Sorry. Not in the chat in the Q. And a.

3245
05:57:54.110 --> 05:57:58.080
Orlando Sequera: I will get it right before Friday. I'm.

3246
05:57:58.250 --> 05:57:59.109
Orlando Sequera: all right.

3247
05:58:03.710 --> 05:58:10.199
Orlando Sequera: That's a lot of contract vehicles past experience. I don't know if any Pms that were involved in contracts.

3248
05:58:10.610 --> 05:58:17.780
Orlando Sequera: It depends on the organization. But for the Pmp. Exam. Assume that you're going to be involved with the contract.

3249
05:58:18.690 --> 05:58:19.440
Orlando Sequera: So

3250
05:58:20.570 --> 05:58:21.920
Orlando Sequera: a

3251
05:58:22.250 --> 05:58:30.770
Orlando Sequera: Yes. Get familiarized with the type of contract that we have here. Assume that you're going to use them for the Pmp. Exempt. That's my best recommendation.

3252
05:58:33.000 --> 05:58:36.200
Orlando Sequera: Please do not forget to fill out the survey.

3253
05:58:36.490 --> 05:58:40.329
Orlando Sequera: We posted the link to the survey in the Q. And a.

3254
05:58:41.010 --> 05:58:42.230
Orlando Sequera: And

3255
05:58:43.570 --> 05:58:46.579
Orlando Sequera: please fill out the survey before the end of the class.

3256
05:58:47.080 --> 05:58:49.160
Orlando Sequera: All right. That's

3257
05:58:50.840 --> 05:59:01.439
Orlando Sequera: What is the difference between contingency and management? Reserve contingency? Reserve is a set amount of money or a set amount of time that we use to address identified risks

3258
05:59:02.450 --> 05:59:20.249
Orlando Sequera: you. An important aspect of our contingency reserves you as the project manager, do not have to ask for permission to use contingency reserves. If any of the risks that were identified for your project. Materialize. Go ahead and use it. You don't have to wait for any authorization manager, and reserve is a little bit different 150.

3259
05:59:20.260 --> 05:59:23.400
Orlando Sequera: It's also a set amount of money and a set amount of time

3260
05:59:24.040 --> 05:59:27.260
Orlando Sequera: that is allocated to address any

3261
05:59:27.610 --> 05:59:30.749
Orlando Sequera: risks that were not identified for your project.

3262
05:59:30.870 --> 05:59:43.600
Orlando Sequera: You need permission to address those you have to ask permission. They you don't have authority to use them, but it's usually the situations in which your level of a 30 are is is not

3263
05:59:44.040 --> 06:00:01.439
Orlando Sequera: you, Don't? You can solve it with project management situations that you can solve it with project management. Imagine it got Forbates a terrorist attack that happens. And in your in your location what do we do? We need? We need more time. There's gonna be a delay to our project. So in situations

3264
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:06.019
Orlando Sequera: let like that, then you have to use management, reserve what you need.

3265
06:00:06.340 --> 06:00:10.550
Orlando Sequera: You need authorization for that. So that is the difference between the 2.

3266
06:00:11.210 --> 06:00:15.569
Orlando Sequera: Okay, we're we're gonna talk about them.

3267
06:00:15.650 --> 06:00:18.230
Orlando Sequera: When we talk about risk.

3268
06:00:18.700 --> 06:00:26.180
Orlando Sequera: our subcontractors consider a bor option and resources needs no. It is an option to fill resources needs so

3269
06:00:26.240 --> 06:00:27.890
Orlando Sequera: sure. Answer is yes.

3270
06:00:33.280 --> 06:00:39.119
Orlando Sequera: in a predicted product environment. If the team to hire a software expert later

3271
06:00:39.420 --> 06:00:42.119
Orlando Sequera: down the project. But this was on in

3272
06:00:42.650 --> 06:00:46.610
Orlando Sequera: these ones, including the scope that the Pm. Need to issue a change request.

3273
06:00:48.010 --> 06:00:48.720
Orlando Sequera: Well.

3274
06:00:49.580 --> 06:00:56.470
Orlando Sequera: yes, if you are able to determine that you need an additional expert, you gotta create a change request, because there is.

3275
06:00:56.670 --> 06:00:59.869
Orlando Sequera: If that wasn't accounted for, you need money

3276
06:01:00.110 --> 06:01:05.770
Orlando Sequera: and you're going to need time. So that has an impact on your project. So yes, you need to go

3277
06:01:05.800 --> 06:01:09.249
Orlando Sequera: a through that approval process. So. Yes.

3278
06:01:22.560 --> 06:01:24.790
Orlando Sequera: okay.

3279
06:01:31.180 --> 06:01:45.669
Orlando Sequera: If the project has multiple complicated procurement requirements for external resourcing, would it be more advantageous to have personnel from the procurement legal departments of your organization to become functional members of the team in most cases that's not going to be possible.

3280
06:01:45.810 --> 06:01:55.740
Orlando Sequera: A. I'm. Not saying no, but in most cases that's not going to be possible. You get to work with them, and they're going to designate a contact person, and you work with them. They have enough on their on their plate

3281
06:01:55.840 --> 06:01:58.910
Orlando Sequera: on the

3282
06:01:59.040 --> 06:02:05.840
Orlando Sequera: to have to be assigned to operate in some cases that might be the case, but it usually that's not what happens. You have to work with them.

3283
06:02:18.760 --> 06:02:20.410
Okay.

3284
06:02:21.500 --> 06:02:24.339
Orlando Sequera: good funding levels we tied up to milestones. Yes.

3285
06:02:29.100 --> 06:02:39.639
Orlando Sequera: Is it bad for a Pm. Not to identify a risk that requires management reserve. Well, remember, we're gonna we're gonna talk about risk, and it's gonna become clear. So

3286
06:02:41.250 --> 06:02:53.220
Orlando Sequera: we have to be as thorough as possible. We're risk identification. We're going to mention that. But it happens we're not there. There are. I'm going to provide some examples that are going to help to understand that a little bit more.

3287
06:02:53.920 --> 06:02:58.690
Orlando Sequera: and so it's mentioned reserve only to us for unknown unknowns. Yes, correct.

3288
06:02:59.060 --> 06:03:00.000
Orlando Sequera: Yes.

3289
06:03:02.360 --> 06:03:08.060
Orlando Sequera: You see a cost plus fixed fee, same as firm contract. I do not.

3290
06:03:09.080 --> 06:03:13.700
Orlando Sequera: i'm not familiar with that terminology. What do you mean by a firm contract? So

3291
06:03:14.120 --> 06:03:15.360
Orlando Sequera: I do not know

3292
06:03:16.710 --> 06:03:18.110
A.

3293
06:03:18.380 --> 06:03:23.629
Orlando Sequera: Can you talk more about burned on charts and Bernoulli chats. When we get to earn value management we will.

3294
06:03:23.880 --> 06:03:25.770
Orlando Sequera: When we get to that.

3295
06:03:25.930 --> 06:03:29.469
Orlando Sequera: please be patient. We're going to get to that point, so please be patient.

3296
06:03:37.420 --> 06:03:40.620
Orlando Sequera: Our ours on Earth queues. May there be procurement team

3297
06:03:41.650 --> 06:03:46.400
Orlando Sequera: by the P. And the Pm. Works with the procurement team to have the those created

3298
06:03:58.340 --> 06:04:01.139
Orlando Sequera: cost based on it can be fine for predictive. Yes.

3299
06:04:06.020 --> 06:04:13.919
Orlando Sequera: Is there a rubric of for source selection criteria? We just went over that the most common aspects of the source selection criteria. We went over. That.

3300
06:04:15.060 --> 06:04:21.580
Orlando Sequera: Is there a grading percentage of scale for a selection criteria that is specific to your organization.

3301
06:04:28.810 --> 06:04:38.190
Orlando Sequera: What is the common thread? I'm. On. Add your contract to set them apart as as your contract. Will that a contract that if you're following an agile approach. You want to follow and add your contract.

3302
06:04:48.610 --> 06:04:53.960
Orlando Sequera: Can you clarify budget, difference on agile and predictive predictive? You want to define the entire budget

3303
06:04:54.280 --> 06:05:04.200
Orlando Sequera: for the entire project. That's how you do it and predict it, for in agile it's more short-term, and there's a reason for that. Remember the scope is changing constantly. That that's why

3304
06:05:17.050 --> 06:05:19.720
Orlando Sequera: it's a question of a slide number 103

3305
06:05:20.000 --> 06:05:25.910
Orlando Sequera: a cost plus an incentive fee, are the typically documented mountains of shipments is

3306
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:27.060
He's

3307
06:05:27.450 --> 06:05:36.479
Orlando Sequera: purely for cost, plus a worthy. I'm sorry this is a question of a slide number 3 cost plus a worth fee. Are there typically documented mountains achievements.

3308
06:05:36.570 --> 06:05:43.900
Orlando Sequera: It's not about master's achieve it. It's about criteria, right. They are very subjective. They're very subjective. The Government

3309
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:46.949
Orlando Sequera: a is notorious for using

3310
06:05:48.640 --> 06:05:50.140
Orlando Sequera: cost plus a worthy

3311
06:05:50.500 --> 06:05:51.660
Orlando Sequera: type of contracts.

3312
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:16.839
Orlando Sequera: The budget cost part of resourcing. No, it's a separate area bodies. It has an impact. Resources have an impact on cost, but they're separate areas. They're not part of resources. They're separate areas of your project

3313
06:06:27.850 --> 06:06:33.020
Orlando Sequera: is the F. The EPA. Similar with C plus escalation. I

3314
06:06:35.240 --> 06:06:38.779
Orlando Sequera: to? I need more context on that. Sorry.

3315
06:06:39.280 --> 06:06:46.409
Orlando Sequera: Are there multiple types of manager and bunch of research? No, there's only one type. It's. It's as a set amount of money

3316
06:06:46.600 --> 06:06:48.330
Orlando Sequera: and a set amount of time.

3317
06:06:49.180 --> 06:06:51.010
Orlando Sequera: Okay, in this case, about money

3318
06:06:51.080 --> 06:06:52.120
Orlando Sequera: it's only one.

3319
06:07:02.170 --> 06:07:06.529
Orlando Sequera: Will the Pmp: exam test on the a specific add-on contract types.

3320
06:07:07.130 --> 06:07:16.510
Orlando Sequera: take practice questions, Take perip your questions, and that's the best way to answer that question. Okay, take the practice questions. In test print.

3321
06:07:26.350 --> 06:07:33.550
Orlando Sequera: Not sure I fully understand the difference between fixed price with incentive fee and fixed price, with the economic price adjustment

3322
06:07:33.670 --> 06:07:44.480
Orlando Sequera: fixed. Price with government press adjustment is for countries that have a long duration, imagine that the government is developing a new class of submarine that can take 25 years

3323
06:07:44.590 --> 06:07:45.200
So.

3324
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:50.460
Orlando Sequera: in order to protect themselves from fluctuations in commodities like oil. For example.

3325
06:07:50.570 --> 06:07:58.050
Orlando Sequera: remember all prices go up, go down. They use a fixed price with economic a price adjustment for that

3326
06:07:58.400 --> 06:08:06.360
Orlando Sequera: fixed price with incentive fee. Simply. If you sell, do you set criteria performance criteria? They buyer?

3327
06:08:06.930 --> 06:08:11.110
Orlando Sequera: No, the seller exists. The criteria. They get an incentive fee

3328
06:08:11.380 --> 06:08:13.559
Orlando Sequera: on top of their profit

3329
06:08:23.920 --> 06:08:28.789
Orlando Sequera: is Cfo key for budget. I'm sorry.

3330
06:08:38.050 --> 06:08:44.030
Orlando Sequera: Could you explain data? Date on Slide 156. You'll have to be. It'll be more specific than that. I don't

3331
06:08:50.790 --> 06:08:56.080
Orlando Sequera: is sow the same as Urs. I do not know what your s stands for. My apologies

3332
06:08:57.100 --> 06:08:58.780
Orlando Sequera: Statement of work. That's what

3333
06:09:01.860 --> 06:09:11.969
Orlando Sequera: the Cfo key for budget reserve across. Generally this is something that you work internally with your. In some cases they might be part of the discussion, but not necessarily.

3334
06:09:12.040 --> 06:09:13.399
Orlando Sequera: They are

3335
06:09:13.830 --> 06:09:19.129
Orlando Sequera: going to be involving every single conversation they have. That's at sea Level Executive. There

3336
06:09:19.180 --> 06:09:24.240
Orlando Sequera: you do this with your your sponsor, with your key stakeholders, but not necessarily the Cfo.

3337
06:09:28.620 --> 06:09:32.740
Orlando Sequera: Can you please read the questions clearly, and doing my best? My apologies

3338
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:46.019
Orlando Sequera: all right. We have come to the end of the session. We're going to stay here to address a few more questions.

3339
06:09:47.000 --> 06:09:48.980
Orlando Sequera: You are

3340
06:09:49.130 --> 06:09:53.300
Orlando Sequera: we have come to the official and please fill out the survey

3341
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:56.210
Orlando Sequera: and please review

3342
06:09:56.370 --> 06:09:58.410
Orlando Sequera: the vocabulary.

3343
06:09:58.490 --> 06:10:12.559
Orlando Sequera: That is important for the exam. You need to re use that terminology. Remember that might change in your organization. It might be different. Okay, it might be different. So thank you very much. Everyone

3344
06:10:12.640 --> 06:10:14.520
Orlando Sequera: I know it's a lot of information.

3345
06:10:15.080 --> 06:10:16.210
Orlando Sequera: and

3346
06:10:17.340 --> 06:10:23.569
Orlando Sequera: we're gonna do it again tomorrow. So we have come officially to the end of the session.

3347
06:10:23.840 --> 06:10:27.670
Orlando Sequera: We're gonna stay here for a few more minutes to answer a few more questions, but

3348
06:10:27.710 --> 06:10:30.149
Orlando Sequera: we will do it again tomorrow.

3349
06:10:30.320 --> 06:10:31.739
Orlando Sequera: Thank you so much.
