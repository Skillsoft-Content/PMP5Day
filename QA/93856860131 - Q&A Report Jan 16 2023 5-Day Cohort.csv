1. The work has to include aspects of project management such as managing scope, schedule, budget, quality, risk, procurement, stakeholders, etc.
2. Make sure they way you describe your project experience is not too technical in detail that the person reviewing your application wouldn't understand your project management work experience.

3. Check the following exam content outline to get an idea of the types of tasks that would be acceptable for the application as well as the PMP Eligibility Requirements.

The PMP ATP training uses the materials provided by PMI from their ""PMI Authorized PMP Exam Prep"", which we refer to in class as the Learner Kit. Their exam prep uses concepts from the Exam Content Outline. The outline is based on various publications (including PMBOK 6 and 7, and the Agile Practice Guide).

1431,do companies try to predict inflation when calculating NPV or a historical reference,Mark Thompson,'-,"Companies typically try to predict future inflation when calculating NPV, as it is an important factor that can affect the value of cash flows over time. Inflation can affect the purchasing power of money, and if not taken into account, it can lead to an overestimation of the value of an investment.

When calculating NPV, companies will use a discount rate that takes into account the expected rate of inflation. This rate is typically the company's cost of capital, which includes the expected rate of return on the investment as well as the expected rate of inflation.

In practice, companies use a combination of both historical reference and prediction. they use historical inflation data to estimate a predicted inflation rate, which is then used in their NPV calculations. It's also common to use the expected inflation rate forecasted by the central bank or other independent economic institutions. Keep in mind that inflation predictions are uncertain, so the NPV calculations will also have a level of uncertainty",1/16/2023 16:06,1/16/2023 17:45,David Robichaud

1432,Will you explain the PV vs NPV again - please?,Jalisa Crutchfield,'-,"PV (Present Value) and NPV (Net Present Value) are both financial metrics used to evaluate the profitability of a potential investment.

PV is a measure of the current value of an investment, taking into account the time value of money. It calculates the value of an investment at a certain point in time, typically the present, by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate.

NPV, on the other hand, is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows of a project or investment. It is used to determine the profitability of an investment by considering all cash flows and the time value of money. A positive NPV indicates that an investment is profitable, while a negative NPV indicates that it is unprofitable.

Basically, PV is a single point in time calculation, while NPV is a cumulation of all cash flows over a period of time.",1/16/2023 16:06,1/16/2023 17:32,David Robichaud

1457,how to verify/validate accuracy of the business value claimed in business case?,Abdulrahman Al-Zahrani,'-,"There are several methods to verify and validate the accuracy of the business value claimed in a business case. For instance:

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) tracking: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the business value claimed in the business case and track them throughout the project. This allows you to measure the actual performance of the project and compare it to the projected performance in the business case.

Post-implementation review: Conduct a post-implementation review of the project to assess the actual business value achieved. This involves gathering feedback from stakeholders and analyzing project data to determine if the project met its objectives and delivered the expected business value.

Return on Investment (ROI) analysis: Use a ROI analysis to evaluate the financial performance of the project and compare it to the projected financial performance in the business case.",1/16/2023 16:13,1/16/2023 18:07,David Robichaud
