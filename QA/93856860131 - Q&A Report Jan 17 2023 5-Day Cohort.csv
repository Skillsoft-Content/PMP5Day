​

How it works:​

​

The suitability filter is an informational tool that combines its assessment with other data and decision-making activities such as the questions we asked earlier and the Stacey complexity model, so that a tailored approach is appropriate for a project. The suitability assessment looks at organizational and project attributes under three main categories using a questionnaire and then an assessment of the answers, as follows. ​

​

Questionnaire asks: ​

Culture: Is there a supportive environment with buy-in for the approach and trust in the team? Team: Is the team of a suitable size to be successful in adopting agile? Do its members have the necessary experience and access to business representatives to be successful? ​Project: Are there high rates of change? Is incremental delivery possible?
