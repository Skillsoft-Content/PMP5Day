Make note of the absence in your attendance tracker in case your certificate does not generate in Percipio, this will be a sort of backup to obtain your completion certificate should Percipio fail to generate it automatically.

Below is a link which can be used to access the session recordings for PMP ATP Bootcamp. Once on the GitHub page, download the excel by selecting the ‘Code’ button and then ‘Download ZIP’. 

In .zip folder you will find an Excel document which contains several worksheets, one for each Bootcamp cohort. The links and password to the recordings will be available in the worksheet. 

Links are updated on a daily basis, so revisit the link to download the updated Excel.

Smartsheet: A cloud-based project management software that allows PMs to collaborate with team members, track progress, and create project documents such as Gantt charts, project timelines, and risk assessments.

Asana: A project management tool that offers features for task tracking, project communication, and document sharing. PMs can create and manage project documents such as project plans, schedules, and status reports.

1344,and would most orgs have them or are we responsible for building our own toolset?,Jacqueline Cunningham,'-,"Most organizations have their own set of project management documents and templates that they use for managing projects. These documents typically include a project charter, project plan, risk management plan, communication plan, and other documents that are required for managing the project successfully.

However, it is not uncommon for a PM to have their own set of project management documents that they bring to the project. These documents may be based on their previous experience or industry best practices, and they can be customized to fit the specific needs of the project.

When starting a new project, the PM should first review the organization's project management documents and templates to see if they can be used for the project. If the organization doesn't have a specific template for a required document, or if the PM feels that their own document would be more appropriate for the project, then they can create their own.",Eian Clair
