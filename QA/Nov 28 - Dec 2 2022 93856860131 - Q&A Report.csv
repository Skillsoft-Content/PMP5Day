A session is considered to be a missed session if you miss more than 15 mins (being logged out) of a session. If you miss more than 1 session, you would have to make up any additional sessions beyond the one by attending live in the next run for the 5-Day Bootcamp.

We ask everyone to manually keep track attendance by using the attendance tracker located in the resources in Percipio and GitHub.

You then upload it only once when you request your certificate. You can access it from GitHub in the 5-Day Attendance and Certificates of Completion Info Video directory.

The following link is where you will upload your attendance tracker when requesting your certificate after you complete the Bootcamp.

1194,Anyway to mute the chat? It becomes a bit overwhelming!!,Christopher Siddharthar,'-,"If you are using the Zoom client click the upward facing carrot by that chat icon, click turn off chat previews

From the iPhone mobile app you can mute using these steps
1. Click the chat
2. Click the bell icon in the upper right hand corner
3. Select Mute

If you do not have the option to turn off previews or mute the chat, here are some suggestions to try:

- Open the chat window and push it off to the side and down, just leaving the title bar showing
- Keep that chat open and try not to pay attention to it, the popups will stop
- If you don't want to see the chat and have two monitors, you can pop-out the chat, put it on your second screen, and put another program in front of it",11/28/2022 14:32,11/28/2022 15:57
