02:59:07	Suzanne Hemann:	any best practices for naming conventions? my team has tried a few different options none seem to work well for us.
02:59:08	Erin Becote:	Agreed!
02:59:09	Christopher Hall:	Version control is also incredibly important
02:59:17	John Norseen:	Naming convention is important but if we use meta data to tag and identify, you could name it whatever and still find it
02:59:21	Moustapha PARAISO ALLI:	Great
02:59:23	Matthew Fultz:	@Olakunle I believe what it was is to remember that in the Agile Methodology, we should remember that the team members are self-organized and in Traditional Methodology the team members are assigned tasks, Hope that's what you meant with the question
02:59:27	Mardellas Morris:	so the search function works !
02:59:27	Suzanne Hemann:	as in some like dates, some like V.1, v.2, v.3 etc.

03:04:54	Gina Thacher:	What is the difference between a Master of Business Administration and PMP?
03:05:21	Michael Oliver:	Everything that is being discussed now sounds like knowledge management & content management. Correct?
03:05:56	Gina Thacher:	Everything sounds like common sense.
03:05:58	John Branch:	Gina - The MBA is a post-graduate academic degree. The PMP is an industry certification 
03:06:53	Michael Oliver:	Mr. Dugger. I agree with your post
