03:55:46	Russell Winn:	which isn't usually the case at all
03:55:47	Paul Dailey:	What about a win, win, win? For all you Office fans out there. :-)
03:56:06	Jason Maass:	Mr. Scott
03:56:22	Paul Dailey:	Haha!
03:56:38	Claudio Bomfim:	Different cultures are different understandings of win
03:56:41	Charmakeitha Smith:	@Mario, I got kicked off before the 1st break and had to log back on.   The speaker says this isn't the norm and may have been a glitch in my area. 
03:56:42	Joseph Stapleton:	Russell, your reputation can suffer too, even if the relationship isn't repeatable. 
03:57:30	John Barnett:	reputations matter
03:57:35	Lisa James:	So true
03:57:46	**Carl Mullin**:	FYI Everyone: If you are being kicked out of the session, please post the details in the Q&A.
03:57:57	Joseph Stapleton:	We use vendors based on reputation and recommendations, even if we only use them once.

03:58:00	Lisa James:	Keep those bridges nice and strong :-)
03:58:08	John Branch:	**Susan Daniels** Is the highlighted difference between Agile and Traditional approaches to several of the concepts discussed so far something that is important for the 2021 PMP Exam updates? Will they be looking to acknowledge the difference between these two in concepts? 
03:58:21	Jorge Arturo Monge:	the same apply not only to the company butb the people you work with
03:58:31	Peace B Salami:	Hello Everyone, apology for joining late...
03:59:29	Ricardo Pena:	Is Agile widely used outside Software Development/Tech industries?
03:59:34	Stephanie Roman:	does this not make things too ambiguous to use metrics for deliverables? 
03:59:34	Ramon Diaz Soto:	Agile can be seen as incremental deliverables? 
03:59:59	Ryan Patterson:	It seems agile is about the same as traditional with more give and take with measurables. Is agile better for environments with unforeseen circumstances?
