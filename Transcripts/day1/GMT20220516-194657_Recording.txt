06:58:16	James Bilyard:	Where can we get a link to this music playlist?
06:58:49	Madhuri Bang:	by when are we planning to close today's session 
06:58:50	Ashley Worboys:	I got my Master of Science in Organizational Leadership in 2003 and I don’t remember any conversation about PMP
06:59:06	Aaron Butler:	@ James LoL
06:59:24	Prince Turner:	I like this play list. Makes me feel like I am in Okinawa. 
07:00:39	Stephen Edmunds:	Virtual Teams need mor ementorship and leadership. Management for them shifts with the projects that are defined
07:01:09	Aaron Butler:	Virtual is harder to focus people, but allows a lot of flexibility!
07:01:21	Jennifer Aguilar:	more effort needs to be made to have touchpoints with team members
07:01:31	Siobhan Meehan:	higher productivity I find
07:02:03	Tom Fuller:	A lot harder to avoid distractions and keep people focused, but can be extremely helpful working across different time zones
07:02:10	Aaron Butler:	@Sibhan, agree! People are motivated when they have flexibility. Also cutting out a commute is very appealing!
07:03:40	Danielle George:	are the slides blurry or is it me?
07:03:45	Siobhan Meehan:	it builds empowerment and accountability from the outset as long as there are clear expectations set and support is there if needed
07:04:29	Jennifer Aguilar:	unfortunately sometimes giving the opportunity creates more work for those physically present
07:04:57	Erin Becote:	@Sioban, I think that is the key, clear expectations and support when needed. Without those things, people feel left to sink or swim, and that's never good
07:05:19	Jyothi Reddi:	very well said
07:06:02	Siobhan Meehan:	100%  But it's a great thing to see people grow and develop and achieve from home
07:06:11	Glen Moody:	Someone should be facilitating the conversation or discussion. 
07:06:23	Siobhan Meehan:	but important to maintain regular contact and engagement
07:06:23	Glen Moody:	Roberts Rules of Order
07:06:52	John Mateer:	depends on the industry. some things just demand a physical presence. i love virtual btw, just can't do it for everything.
07:06:55	Lisa Huerth:	I currently work remote & it is fantastic for flexibility & productivity!
07:06:58	Bryan Saunders:	This is very helpful for people that are hard of hearing.
07:07:00	Andrew Potts:	I just completed an entire MBA online using zoom and 365. Its definitely a workable solution for virtual teams and collaboration. 
07:07:07	Christopher Mascarina:	We have Monday and Friday team meet which is what we call Start week and end of week meet that gets presented with powerpoint. Awesome transparency even for those who are not directly involve with the project.
07:07:15	Henry Guevara:	I would also add title and department to know who that person is representing
07:08:09	Siobhan Meehan:	I run virtual customer service contact centres and we have moved 100% of our business to virtual over the last 4 years
07:08:17	Jill Baker:	I’me thinking about switching over to Microsoft 365 and Teams
07:09:06	Ian Randall:	The problem is always with the "distant end".
07:09:21	Jill Baker:	Icebreakers?
07:09:37	Justin Bono:	Communication is the most important thing
07:09:43	Paul Dailey:	I work in Whirlpool GIS and we're a very hybrid on site/virtual team. It's nearly seamless for us now.
07:09:52	Andrew Potts:	Once everyone learns and follows virtual etiquette, things become much easier.
07:11:11	Cindy Cuencas:	Part of onboarding should be a 101 brief that provides project/program overview, objectives, roles, and expectations. At minimum
07:11:37	Aaron Butler:	Ooh, tricky. High performing team members are potentially agitated by having to pick up slack of those who are not
07:11:38	Christopher Mascarina:	You are exactly right Andrew! like coming in on time and set up early- be prepared. 
07:12:14	Ian Randall:	@ Aaron - Bingo!
07:12:29	Andrew Potts:	That, and learning to raise your virtual hand to speak. But yes, preparedness is an absolute requirement. 
07:12:41	Daniel Cooper:	We have implemented a cameras on policy and it has had great results. 
07:12:51	Siobhan Meehan:	but then thats where R&R comes into it's own- recognise the high performers 
07:13:22	Mike Franco:	get their voices on the table
07:13:51	Ramon Diaz Soto:	That's how you build trust, loyalty, and a strong collaborative team
07:13:51	Kara Vernon:	Does anyone have the link to these slides like the previous set? Sorry if I missed it
07:13:58	Christopher French:	We have actually done the opposite, having only the person presenting on camera due to bandwidth concerns.
07:14:00	Jill Baker:	Small virtual teams can have a “go around” to share their day
07:14:20	Aaron Butler:	@ Kara The GitHub Site is: https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5Day And, if you are a Percipio user, please access the slides from the Resources tab in Percipio. 1.

07:17:50	Alexander Lenz:	morning "stand up" meeting
07:18:57	Kara Vernon:	yes hehe thanks
07:19:50	David Chui:	There are people that don't ever check e-mails?
07:19:51	John Mateer:	we always had to publish primary, alternate, tertiary communication plans for our virtual meetings.
07:20:10	Kara Vernon:	Thats impressive
07:20:20	Eduardo Defendini:	twilio
07:20:23	Phillip Hiner:	Doesn’t that take a lot of extra time?
07:20:39	Phillip Hiner:	To tailor communication to the individual?
07:21:03	Charmakeitha Smith:	staff calls and backbriefs
07:21:14	Christy Van Den Heuvel:	My former team lead would always say "An email sent is not an email received" because her inbox was always flooded with emails so she'd always ask for a follow-up call if the email was urgent.
07:21:35	Timothy Wolfe:	Or if they're in too many meetings, and yet still curiously aren't getting enough information...
07:21:49	Anthony Feige:	PACE plan
07:21:51	Romayne Barto:	i use that with my team today, email, call teams face to face
07:22:18	Ryan Culhane:	Need to standardize on one platform, too many people on different platforms take too much time or miss someone (text, teams, Email, etc)
07:22:19	Carmelo Rosario:	Yup, always PACE
07:22:47	Anthony Feige:	Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency (PACE) method
07:23:10	Ramses Brunache:	Time Zone consideration is very important
07:23:43	John Mateer:	good point! time zones matter.
07:23:50	Matthew Rippard:	pace
07:24:02	Aaron Butler:	and clearly communicating which time zone you are referring to
07:24:03	Kara Vernon:	Adding that to the stakeholder registry would be really helpful!
07:24:04	Quadeshia Smith:	p.a.c.e.
07:24:25	Christopher Brown:	My boss gets so much email I have become the filter to let him know what is importatnt and needs att
07:24:32	Christopher Brown:	attention
07:24:35	Lucas Frank:	Communication is message send, message receipt + FEEDBACK
07:25:01	Christy Van Den Heuvel:	@Christopher Brown that's exactly what I did for my team lead
07:25:16	Christopher Brown:	Email is actually a poor tool now compared to tools like Teams and Slack.
07:25:37	Lee Cooper:	Also called "Battle Rhythm"
07:25:52	Aaron Butler:	Email is great f used in conjunction with something else. It gives you areference and document to look back at
07:25:59	Ryan Marcotte:	Are Timeboxed meetings reoccurring?
07:26:06	Christopher Brown:	Good book...https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/
07:27:13	David Chui:	pre-meetings + meetings + post meeting meeting
07:27:15	Jennifer Aguilar:	have an agenda
07:27:21	Phillip Hiner:	Ok warriors we get the buzz words..you’re all up in my OODA loop. Get ready for corporate America and check your jive military lingo at the door.
07:27:29	Lee Cooper:	Marine planners call it Rule of 3
07:27:34	Siobhan Meehan:	meetings about meetings...., sigh :-(
07:27:52	Charles Slagle:	"Battle Rhythm"
07:28:17	Carmelo Rosario:	if possible, provide read ahead, as that usually cuts the meeting time = less questions
07:28:22	Michael Oliver:	Set IPR meetings with time limits goals and expectations
07:28:52	Michael Oliver:	IPR in progress review just in case
07:28:54	Carl Hawkins:	this is where a SCRUM master comes in play, to keep the meetings on point
07:29:06	Christy Van Den Heuvel:	@Carmelo Rosario - agreed, read-aheads are helpful and something I did with my last team quite often
07:29:14	Aaron Butler:	@Carmelo, until you have the group that doesn't read the email, then they ask the questions anyway and derail the meeting
07:29:19	Mario Kazniakowski:	I keep on getting logged of too often.  I logged the last 4 exact times and it seems that there is a pattern.  Something odd going on with the system 14:32, 14:52, 15:32, 16:12
07:29:49	Amado Mena:	Charles -  Business Rhythm..... on the civilian side :)
07:29:55	Marty Maust:	If, in a meeting you speak and it starts with "let me piggy back on what was just said" or "To echo what xxx said" then you have no purpose or reason in speaking
07:29:58	Clayborne Taylor:	Provide agenda for expectations ahead of time
07:30:20	Carmelo Rosario:	@Aaron That's correct. It has definitely happened to me in the past. 
07:30:34	Viola Fisher:	well said
07:30:49	Charmakeitha Smith:	in process review read aheads are a great tool
07:31:03	Michael Oliver:	Yes ipr’s
07:31:24	Lisa James:	Love how you worded that -  "work their own issue."  
07:31:43	Mark Murphy:	Cancel rarely. Canceling says it's not important to you.  You can only cancel so often before people take it less seriously because they assume it probably won't happen.  If you don't have enough to have a meeting that frequently, Reschedule at a frequency that's reliably productive..  Make it worth their time.
07:31:47	Christopher Brown:	I learned that every meeting should end with a clear understanding of "who is doing what by when" and set a  follow up date/time.
07:32:51	Cindy Cuencas:	@Christopher agreed
07:33:44	Aaron Butler:	@ Chris, yes! How many times is "we" said at meetings? We = will do it = no one will or multiple people will = time waste
07:34:06	Cindy Cuencas:	I've been in hour long meeting where, outside, no one knew who was doing what and when it was due. 
07:34:40	David Chui:	seems to goes against RACI chart for everyone to be Accountable hmmmm. 
07:34:59	Stephen Moss:	theres no i in team
07:35:28	Seth Maldonado:	but there's an M and an E
07:36:02	Justin Bono:	Why does this still say lesson 1? 
07:36:36	Ruben Hernandez:	Lesson 1 0f 5
07:36:53	Robert Ross:	Where did you say we get these slides?
07:37:00	Carmelo Rosario:	@Justin Slide 2 has the answer
07:37:23	Tom Fuller:	there are under resources on Percipio
07:37:24	Seth Maldonado:	indivduals need to hold themselves accountable to the team
07:37:26	Stephen Edmunds:	Percipio users under the bootcamp resrouces
07:37:40	Robert Ross:	Thanks team
07:37:47	John Mateer:	team is responsible for the entire team's production. pm is accountable for team's production.
07:37:47	Stephen Edmunds:	The otheres are under github linked by the mentors

07:39:23	David Chui:	Thank you
07:40:11	Mark Murphy:	It's not enough for members to just know their piece.  They need to know how it fits into the big picture.  Synergy and shared vision is important..  An orchestra doesn't work unless everyone has the score.
07:40:15	Levi Burgess:	band is only as strong as its weakest player
07:46:45	MAIMA KAMARA:	so do u follow their plan ( sponsor)?
07:46:58	Jorge Arturo Monge:	is this happening in one call or is a process of different meetings where we can shape de charter along with the sponsors?
07:48:44	Stephen Edmunds:	Like a Salary Negoiation you list a range not a number
07:49:03	Simone Bonner:	.
07:51:24	Stephen Moss:	is the project charter the same as the PID
07:51:44	Andrew Dugger:	Is the Project Charter contractually binding or running estimate to be reviewed periodically?
07:53:24	Dave Embrey:	I see a few oitfalls here...sponsors cannot articulate well the what and why. And, sponsors not communicating well through the organization your authority to get a team moving and working a project
07:54:32	Raymond Lawson:	If your not the expert how do you know if the budget is right or what to suggest?
07:54:36	Billy Hirschfield:	Where can we go to see some examples of project charters?
07:54:42	John Mateer:	i've experienced a sponsor not really knowing what they want at the start and then halfway through the project, redirect because he knew he didn't want where we were headed. :-(
07:54:52	Amado Mena:	Is the project charter the same as a Statement of Work (SOW)?
07:55:30	Ramon Diaz Soto:	I was thinking the same thing, Amado. I thought of it as a SOU or MOU.
07:55:42	**Carl Mullin**:	You may want to check PMIStandards+ for examples. You can also try this web page. https://www.projectmanagementdocs.com/#axzz7TUBIwieG
07:57:51	Justin Delpalacio:	did anyone elses computer freeze up?
07:58:22	Keemiya Pourmonir:	no
07:58:25	**Carl Mullin**:	No freeze up here.
07:58:44	Marcus Rybicki:	yes my computer froze up too. both screens went blank and came back on. super weird. Hoping my attendance isn't affected.
07:58:51	Marquise Bowman:	all good here
07:58:53	Justin Delpalacio:	me too
07:59:00	Billy Hirschfield:	thank you Carl
07:59:16	Justin Delpalacio:	all good now
07:59:29	Aimee McLaughlin:	Susan, you're talking clearly and thoughtfully and keeping our attention beautifully! 
07:59:39	Amado Mena:	Thank you!
07:59:55	Kelly Brown:	Totally agree, Aimee. Great job, Susan.
08:00:11	Jill Baker:	Thanks Susan
08:00:50	Viola Fisher:	Yes I agree, you see doing great Susan
08:01:24	Stephen Edmunds:	Agile is bebenficial but you still need to herd cats to include yourself
08:01:25	Melody Mechanic:	I agree! Great course, Susan
08:01:28	Aaron Butler:	Would deciding what method to use be an area where it would make sense to collaborate with SMEs, or does the  Project Mgr figure this out on their own?
08:01:55	Siobhan Meehan:	TY
08:02:03	Marquise Bowman:	TY
