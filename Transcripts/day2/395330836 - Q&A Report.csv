Am i still getting credit for the course if i am attending via zoom instead of precipio?",Yohannis Swaby,'-,"Please note that if you join from the direct link or through Zoom using the Webinar ID and Password, you will lose tracking from Percipio.

And so we recommend logging in through Percipio to use to access your Bootcamp and use Zoom only if absolutely necessary.",05/17/2022 12:02:52,05/17/2022 12:05:22,

146,Percipio User- I have dropped 3x already this morning. What might be causing this. I am able to log back in quickly. Anything I can try?,Karen Smith,'-,"It may be tied to your account settings in Percipio. For instance, it might be set to drop if you are idle in Percipio for a certain amount of time. I would suggest checking with your organizatation's training coordinator or admin team to verify the settings.

In the meantime, you can try using the direct Zoom link instead of joining from your training site.

Will there be a 7th (current) version we can download?  Thanks.",Jason Vulcan,'-,The slides will have Guidelines for the title. There isn't anything specific to the PMBOK Guide 7th Edition. I would recommend becoming a paid PMI Member. Your exam fee + being a paid PMI member is less than the fee for a non member and you get a free copy of the PMBOK Guide 7th Edition.,05/17/2022 12:08:57,05/17/2022 12:19:45,

153,"Carl - Thanks.  Found what I needed in skimming exam outline and PMBOK 6/7.  As many note, the hardest part of the PMP exam, and perhaps the only part that's hard if you have any experience, is the PMP-unique terminology and their tricky list of tasks/activities/tools/etc.  IMHO diving into slides without starting with a brief overview of the current PMI framework is not as useful.  Bottom line, I got what I needed.  Thanks.       ",Dawn Dunlop,'-,You're welcome Dawn,05/17/2022 12:14:09,05/17/2022 12:14:43,

161,David/Carl - I found this when trying to copy some of the Zoom text.  This is due to the "Prevent participants from saving chat" setting being enabled in the Zoom meeting host's settings at https://umich.zoom.us/profile/setting. This setting must be deselected in order to allow participants to have the ability to copy or save chats sent within a Zoom meeting.  Please enable if you are able.,Ryan Marcotte,'-,I have passed the issue about copying from the chat. I'm not sure if they will be able to do it.

A session is considered to be a missed session if you miss more than 15 mins in a session. If you miss more than 1 session, you would have to make up any additional sessions beyond the one by attending live in the next run for the 5-Day Bootcamp. You can't mix sessions between the 5-Day and 8-Day Bootcamp to get the 35 hours.

And so you can miss more than 15 mins in one session and make it up on Replay and ensure you don't miss more than 15 mins in any of the other live sessions. If you do, you would have to make up any other missed live sessions in the next live run of a 5-Day Bootcamp.",05/17/2022 15:34:05,05/17/2022 15:37:59,

For Each Session: Stay logged in for the entire session.

If you do miss 15 mins in one session you are allowd to make it up on Replay. If you miss more than 15 mins in more than one session, then you have to attend live for any sessions you missed above the one session missed allowed.
