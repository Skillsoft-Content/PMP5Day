01:24:30	Bryan Saunders:	Carl, I am still not seeing the closed captions button. I have tried to log in via zoom and percipio. Any suggestions. I am hard of hearing.
01:24:49	Julian Walle:	Q&A
01:25:22	Russell Winn:	how does the scope statement differ from the vision or mission statement? Or is it some of both?
01:25:25	Ramses Brunache:	Enablers add life and color to the project. They are known as the glue that keeps the team together. An enabler can exist within the project team, and he or she doesn't have to be the project manager.
01:25:34	Dawn Dunlop:	Susan - Is Project Implementation Plan the same as old Project Management Plan?
01:26:17	Michael McDonald:	From an exam perspective, is it safe to prioritize Scope over cost and schedule, if asked?  Or is that just a real world application discussion?
01:26:31	Russell Winn:	***SUSAN DANIELS*** how does scope statement differ from mission and vision statements, or is the same in some sense

01:28:01	Erin Becote:	Vision would = business value? 
01:28:04	Carleythia Anderson:	WBS = work breakdown structure
01:28:12	Ryan Marcotte:	Question: Def of Scop Management Plan - A component of the project or program management plan that describes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled and validated.  I thought Proj Management Plan is called the PIP?
01:29:26	Djamal Bouchou:	are the recordings of this classes going to be shared with us?

Thanks 
01:29:29	Arthur Wood:	Arthur Wood

01:31:47	Michael Franco:	**Susan** : Who approves the Scope Management Plan? 
01:32:57	Kimberley Tuttle:	Scope versus sow?
01:33:16	Dawn Dunlop:	Susan, can you describe how these Tools & Techniques relate to Enablers and Deliverables in the new PMP structure.  You mentioned ITTO is old and out, but many of your slides still addresses T&T.
01:33:20	Norman Johnson:	does scope define the way we go from current state to end state?
01:33:57	Alex Broud:	is the scope then real world borders of the idea of the project and the charter is the hypothetical? 
01:34:45	Shadd Neighbors:	lost sound again
01:35:00	Raymond Lawson:	Adapt to the changes
01:35:32	Kimberley Tuttle:	What would be the big difference between scope and SOW?
01:35:53	Gibb Little:	Scope mgmt plan is the framework (internal doc) and SOW is more detailed and is part of contract
01:36:43	Troy Lindsay:	Plan, Manage and Scope.....I like it
01:36:58	Michael O'Leary:	Would you say that project requirements are the means
01:37:50	Jason Maass:	Susan. You use the term "Backlogs" often. Could you please explain what that means?
01:39:43	Bryan Saunders:	Is a WBS like a flow chart?
01:39:48	Daniel Beckman:	Backlogs are the project tasks of lower priority that the agile team will address over time?
01:40:16	Michael Fresenburg:	resource avalability
01:40:22	Raymond Lawson:	The slides for Lesson 2 Topic A are not in the resource library it starts at Topic B
01:40:23	Carlos Duque:	can WBS be organized in phases? specially in construction?
01:40:25	Phillip Christensen:	backlog = ordered list of work to be done
01:40:40	John Mateer:	I see WBS like a word doc Gantt chart.
01:40:58	Shrikant Kulkarni:	Does the WBS created for each team or process?
01:41:08	Christopher Mascarina:	Work breakdown structure PMP
WBS Concepts
A WBS, as defined in the PMBOK¬Æ Guide‚ÄîThird Edition is ‚Äúa deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project.
01:41:08	Erin Becote:	Would a Kanban be part of the WBS?
01:41:19	Eddie Utuk:	If working on a cross-functional or cross-divisional project can you organize the WBS by work streams?
01:41:36	Stephen Moss:	product breakdown structure
01:41:47	Brenda Calvert:	@raymond - page 28
01:42:12	Abhishek Srivastava:	Is Resource management plan shows up in wbs?
01:42:44	Eddie Utuk:	thank you very much Susan
01:42:50	Christopher Hall:	We have frequently used backlog and stories when discussing Agile methodologies. I am not familiar with these terms. Should I be, or will that be covered Friday?
01:43:32	Raymond Lawson:	backwards Planning?
01:44:23	Phillip Christensen:	Key word in WBS is decomposition. Breaking down large pieces of the work into smaller components.
01:44:39	Sequoia Sime-Geffner:	**Susan** can we please review the definition of user stories?
01:45:28	Daniel Beckman:	backlog: An ordered list of user-centric requirements that a team maintains for a product.
01:45:30	Daniel Beckman:	user story: A brief description of deliverable value for a specific user; a promise for a conversation to clarify details.
01:48:00	Daphne Marsh:	On the previous slide on the third checkmark, does "project management plan" mean "project implementation plan"? Is "project management plan" the old terminology?

01:49:05	Sarina Miller:	no
01:49:05	Tellis Carr:	no
01:49:06	Cierra White:	No

01:49:11	Seth Maldonado:	HELD TO EXCELLENCE
01:49:13	Carlos Duque:	n
01:49:19	John Barnett:	not unless you want to be continuously disappointed
01:49:30	John Mateer:	No. Perfection costs too much.
01:49:32	Rolando Ramirez:	**Susan** Are there some "standard" numbers for tolerance for this slide?
01:49:57	Ryan McIlquham:	Tolerances= Knowing your left and right limits to enable you to make decisions in a timely manner
01:50:12	Rolando Ramirez:	**Susan** Got it you answered my question with "range"
01:51:22	Patrick cochrane :	Susan can you please give an example of a "non-functional" solution 
01:51:43	Aimee McLaughlin:	Wouldn't the client also have to approve the tolerances?
01:51:49	Alex Broud:	is there a scale/% to draw from for adequate budget asks
01:51:53	Charmakeitha Smith:	tolerances are used to delegate authority from a higher management level to a lower level
01:52:14	Mohan Mylvaganam:	where should the tolerances be mentioned?
01:53:02	Julie Siripoke:	non-functional requirements describe how the system works, while functional requirements describe what the system should d
01:53:08	Jonathan Luminati:	What is the relationship between tolerances and management reserve?
01:53:27	Mario Pais:	How are tolerance level determined? Through expert judgment, meetings, etc.?
01:53:28	Julian Walle:	five 9's preferred
01:54:05	Mark Murphy:	I'
01:54:38	Raymond Lawson:	Management reserve is when you are over budget
01:55:08	Paul Dailey:	Do you have any experience with RAC (Request for Asset Capital) and how that informs tolerances?
01:55:09	Ian Fryman:	Manageing the scope mgmt plan, tolerances can technically be modified as you go, right?
01:55:53	Ian Fryman:	thx
01:56:52	Kimon Jefferson:	similar to a swing?
01:57:10	Kimon Jefferson:	in contract speak
01:57:15	Michael McDonald:	Are "Tolerances" different than "Contingency"?  they sound the same
01:57:20	Peter Thompson:	EEFs = Enterprise Environmental Factors
OPAs = Organizational Process Assets
01:57:48	Michael McDonald:	ex. I have 7% contingency on my current project, approved by management.  But I don't have any "tolerances"... 
01:58:51	Timothy Wolfe:	Grandpa?
01:59:51	Benjamin Brumfield:	EEF: Government, federal regulations
02:00:28	Benjamin Brumfield:	OPA: Internal policies and regulations
02:01:31	Heema Sharma:	for EEF, can you review how "resource availability" differs from OPAs like SOPs? 
02:01:53	Michelle Fortier:	So essentially OPA = tangible vs EEF = intangible
02:01:56	Michelle Fortier:	?
02:02:07	Tellis Carr:	EEFs and OPAs are similar to a SWOT analysis?
02:02:18	Aimee McLaughlin:	EEFs and OPAs should be written out clearly in the Scope Management Plan, correct?
02:02:24	Heema Sharma:	Ah, got it. Thanks so much!!

02:04:44	Felix Lora:	Good
02:05:10	Faisal Munib:	great video
02:05:30	Dawn Dunlop:	Isn't org culture defined by PMP as an EEF? (not separate as video suggests)?
02:05:57	Timothy Wolfe:	I dunno, Faisal.  That lady in the green dress was swinging that briefcase a little too wildly for my comfort.
02:06:40	John Barnett:	the pre-existing culture when you take over a project may take a long time to effect change Dawn
02:07:28	Arianne Wilson:	I see a little bit of both in my workplace

02:07:30	Ryan McIlquham:	YOu are on mute
02:07:46	Lisa James:	You're muted :-)
02:07:46	Stefanos Koutsiumpis:	we cannot hear you
02:07:46	Michelle Fortier:	Susan - you are muted
02:07:49	Stefanos Koutsiumpis:	you are on mute
02:07:51	Cassie Strojny:	No audio
02:07:57	Shemeika Jones:	Got it
02:07:58	John Barnett:	Its something you should be aware of when planning a project...wanted changes to culture may influence your norms and values you determine/vocalize when building your team
02:08:01	Jim Shaw:	I think the scope of project can also impact as well. For example, project internal to org versus project where customer is exsternal to org. In the former, org culture may be more OPA versus more "EEF for the latter (especially if customer is external org).
02:08:02	David Robichaud:	*** Please note that if you muted Shared Sound earlier, you will need to uncheck that option in order to hear the sound of any videos being played
02:08:05	Erin Becote:	**Susan** Would the EEFs need to be listed in the risk management plan if there's concern a potential change (i.e. in legislature) might affect the project deliverables?
02:09:14	Lee Cooper:	Would SOPs fall under EEF or OPA.  It seems to work under both classifications.
02:09:27	Paul Dailey:	OPA
02:09:32	Lanita Simon:	Opa
02:09:48	Michael McDonald:	SOPs= OAP  (Organization specific)
02:10:03	Jim Shaw:	I think that SOPs whether EEF or OPA depends on whose SOPs. Again, this can depend on who the project customer is. 
02:10:44	Glomani Bravo-Lopez:	Can we please all check the chat before typing and saying the same thing as 100 others? It makes it extremely hard to keep up with useful information within the chat, in addition to listening to Susan and keeping up with the slides.
02:11:15	Reuben Greene:	Do we get these slides at the end for future review/ studying?
02:12:09	Arianne Wilson:	@Reuben Greene: slides are here https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5Day/tree/main/Slide%20Decks
02:12:16	John Barnett:	Reuben if you are percipio they are available for download in the library resource tab
