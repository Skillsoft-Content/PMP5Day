03:34:14	**Carl Mullin**:	Please do not share the recording links with anyone.
03:35:45	Anitha Kurunthachalam:	thanks
03:36:40	Sean Whiteman:	**Taylor** not for WBS but I have seen other slight differences.  Unfortunately the 7th edition is a secure copy and cannot coy and paste
03:36:55	Lisa Huerth:	Apologies - I got that from the Q&A because a lot of us had issues being dropped continuously yesterday.
03:37:22	Frank Carranco:	test
03:38:20	Dave Embrey:	Carl, i did not see the automated attendance tracker showing my attendance. I only saw the attendance tracker in the library which is a word document i can fill in to track my own attendance. Im looking for an automated tracker that shows my attendance as tracked by the system. Please advise
03:38:59	**Carl Mullin**:	For those that are not familiar with the differences between the PMBOK Guides in general please see the following: https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/other-images/standards/changes-to-pmbok-guide-7th-edition.png
03:39:15	**Carl Mullin**:	For specific differences you would need to check each one out.
03:39:34	Taylor Stephens:	Thank you 
03:39:47	Desmond Peters:	Thanks!
03:39:58	**Carl Mullin**:	The attendance tracker is a document for you to download. It is for you to manually keep track of your attendance in case you get disconnected for example.
03:40:26	**Carl Mullin**:	Your learning portal or Zoom will automatically tack you, but you won't be able to see that tracking.
03:41:27	Dave Embrey:	Carl, copy. I was under the impression we could access the system tracker that shows our attendance. Is there not such a mechanism?
03:42:39	Norman Johnson:	does Work package =mdeliverable?
03:42:51	Christopher Hall:	Is another way of describing a work package a task?
03:43:03	Jason Maass:	Would love to see a working example of a WBS and have you explain off of that.
03:43:06	**Carl Mullin**:	No, you can't (and even I can't) access a student's attendance that is being tracked. You an download the attendance tracker document to manually track your attendance.
03:43:42	Daniel Beckman:	^ agreed with Jason. A practical example of WBS would be aweosme
03:43:50	Suzanne Hemann:	WRT Control Account - you said you can put them further down into the WBS I'm not sure what that means, in this structure would that mean one or two work packages would be under a control account? so under 2.2?
03:43:53	Gibb Little:	Wouldn't Planning Package A be 1.1.1, not 1.2
03:45:24	Lee Cooper:	***Susan***. Is Identifier similar to a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN)?
03:46:01	John Barnett:	i think control accounts are more titles or areas if you will...planning package is a broad general service...work package is detailed things to accomplish that particular service
03:46:19	John Barnett:	@suzanne
03:46:43	Andrew Dugger:	What are the best conflict resolution methodologies when a section tries to bill inappropriately to wrong WBS package for outside the project tasks/ hours?
03:47:40	Kimon Jefferson:	yes, can we confirm the numbering sequence for the different tiers (referencing Gibb's question above)
03:50:42	Alex Broud:	do we build in a critical path within the WBS
03:51:22	Dawn Dunlop:	No
03:51:36	Ramon Diaz Soto:	Very good descriptive video
03:51:46	**Carl Mullin**:	A network diagram is used to help determine the critical path.
03:51:59	Ian Randall:	What software do you often used to develop a WBS? I see a few options, e.g.,  excel, visio,....
03:52:15	**Carl Mullin**:	Microsoft Project
03:52:19	John Branch:	From the Practice Standard for WBS - 3rd edition. "A Control Account is - a management control point where scope, budget, actual cost, and schedule are integrated and compared to earn value for performance measurement. "
03:52:31	Jennifer Smith:	I missed one of the key four element can you restate?
1. Assign team
2. 
3. Project Schedule
4. Cost estimates
03:52:58	John Barnett:	control the project @jennier
03:52:59	Charmakeitha Smith:	2.  control 
03:53:02	Eddie Utuk:	Project Budget
03:53:18	Jennifer Smith:	Charmekeitha:  Thanks
03:53:22	Bryan Saunders:	Control
03:53:25	Jon Kincaid:	controls project as it progresses
03:53:49	Juliana Osuoha:	is there any particular tool for setting up the WBS diagrams
03:54:49	**Carl Mullin**:	You can use software such as Microsoft Project to setup your WBS.
03:55:19	Juliana Osuoha:	Thanks, Carl
03:55:53	**Carl Mullin**:	You're welcome
04:00:53	Issa Sall:	IS WBS  the same as schedule management plan?
04:04:23	John Branch:	@Issa - The WBS is more of the "What" to be done. It breaks down every task into its simplest level. The SMP establishes the basis for the "When" (rules of scheduling, etc)

04:06:32	Issa Sall:	thanks John
04:06:36	Sequoia Sime-Geffner:	hybrid?
04:06:37	Luis Vega:	Longest I've seen is 10 week sprints but that was with a very mature software development shop. I can't remember their reason for using 10 week sprints but it worked for them.
04:06:43	Maria Beltre:	we have 2 weeks iterations but modified to 3 if needed 
04:08:18	Anthony Feige:	Should the iterations by based on the total length of the project (12+ month long project having a longer period between iterations)?
04:08:56	Lisa James:	Which was the lowest level?   Task on schedules?
04:09:41	Gibb Little:	Are tasks and activities the same?
04:10:00	Norman Johnson:	is a milestone similar to objective or intermediate objective?
04:10:17	John Branch:	*** Susan *** You said Milestones are two things: 1) Marks the end of a major body of work. What was #2? 
04:10:42	Dawn Dunlop:	i expect #2 is that milestone is zero duration.
04:11:24	Christopher Newell:	#2 being a significant point 
04:11:26	Brenda Calvert:	Zero duration days John Branch 
04:11:37	John Branch:	Copy, thanks! 
04:11:39	Alex Broud:	tasks builds the data points on the information to be reported to the milestone objective?
04:12:16	Michael Oliver:	Is there one product that all of these other products build off of? It seems like there are a lot of different charts to say the same thing in different ways.  Is is the WBS?
04:14:05	Adam Cannon:	Can activity dependencies cross work packages?
04:14:33	Paul Dailey:	Is that the same as "Slack?"
04:14:49	Charmakeitha Smith:	0 duration was the second point of a milestone

04:23:47	Susan Daniels:	@ Halley  Activity Relationships and Dependencies
04:25:05	Zendre L Glymph:	Finish to Finish- One activity has finish before another activity can finish
04:25:24	Benjamin Smith:	In the Start to finish...Activity A was the first shift of nurses, and Activity B was the second shift, but the diagram showed B happening after A?
04:25:33	Robert Sproat:	Can you provide a good example of Start to Finish?
04:25:40	**Carl Mullin**:	If you missed a dependence type, please check this document. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/link-tasks-in-a-project-31b918ce-4b71-475c-9d6b-0ee501b4be57
04:26:19	**Carl Mullin**:	There are good examples on the link I provided.
04:26:21	Claudio Bomfim:	No. it is finish to start Susa..
04:26:24	Ryan Pursley:	= Start in order to Finish
04:26:36	Adam Cannon:	Does the WBS Dictionary survey/questionnaire provide an opportunity for individuals to highlight activity dependencies (at least that they are aware of)?
04:26:46	Morgan Libby:	start to finish?
04:26:49	Spencer Clark:	I think you have them mixed up
04:27:31	Victor C. Miranda:	I understood finish to start is the most common type of relationship
04:27:54	Paul Dailey:	A good way to think of Start to Finish is security watch turnover. Your relief must start before you can finish.
04:28:46	Robert Ross:	Will you go back over your method of sending the survey?
04:28:48	Lisa James:	Start to start 
04:28:53	David Delgado:	any example of start to start
04:28:54	Jason Maass:	Is the WBS Dictionary a Separate doc that you send out to your subject matter expert to get a breakdown of the task and then use that info to create WBS chart?
04:28:55	David Delgado:	?
04:28:56	Lisa James:	and fininsh to finish
04:29:03	Heema Sharma:	can you review the difference between task and activity or are they synonymous?
04:29:08	Rayza Collazo:	Can you go over finish to finish?
04:29:13	Matthew Lofton:	800? did I hear that right?
04:29:16	David Franco:	Could we get a few sample questions covering the topics this morning?

04:29:27	Michelle Fortier:	I agree David!
04:29:28	Aprile Atwater:	There are a lot of documents to track.  Is there an order in which we should/could expect to create/use the documents for a project?
04:29:30	Siobhan Meehan:	All of the elements we have discussed today are based on Tradition/Hybrid models? With some elements being translated to Agile (itterations) that correct?
04:29:54	Robert Maurer:	Whatever is going to be the most helpful on the exam haha
04:29:55	Felicia Assan:	pls repeat slower

04:30:00	Heema Sharma:	yes, thank you!
04:30:02	John Norseen:	To clarify Task equates to Work Package
04:30:04	Robert Ross:	Will you go back over your method of sending the WBS Dictionary survey?
04:30:08	John Barnett:	is there a consolidated flow chart for the components of the project development....i.e. visual connections for what we've covered
04:30:20	Michael O'Leary:	Can you recap the flow from team->WBS->Scope->Schedule->Budget/Resources->
04:30:28	India Anderson:	Can you go over the difference between the Milestone Chart and the Milestone list
04:30:30	John Norseen:	Activity is an action (verb) for the Work Package (noun), correct?
04:30:47	Charmakeitha Smith:	In a work package can you explain what identifiers are again?
04:31:08	Raymond Lawson:	Can you give a quick example of what you emailed out/requested for the WBS dictionary.
04:31:10	Amado Mena:	CCBs.... :(
04:33:16	Ramon Diaz Soto:	To clarify, sponsors are clients and stakeholders are collaborative team members, government standards, etc?
04:34:07	Michael Roth:	Sponsor is the bankroller. Stakeholders are people who are or perceive to be affected by a project.
04:34:09	Bryan Lerner:	The video mentioned "float" in relation to sequencing. Could you define that again for us? 
04:34:29	Michael Roth:	Sponsors can be stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are sponsors
04:34:38	Michael Oliver:	Caveat to April Atwater: With all of the products that have been discussed, is there a main product that all others will fall back to or be built off of? Is there a systematic flow chart that shows the order if there is one that all of these different products should be published?
04:35:22	Ramon Diaz Soto:	thanks 
04:35:24	John Branch:	7th edition is now on the PMI Website

04:37:58	George Gyles:	What is the test on 6th or 7th?
04:38:02	Gibb Little:	Do we need to purchase the PMBOK Guide in addition to the Learner Kit to have the tools needed to pass the test?
04:38:03	Stephen Edmunds:	Read the testing guideline on the test and it will give you guidiance
04:38:41	James Jackson:	what version of PMBOK should I study for the Exam, v6 or v7, or both?
04:38:44	Geoffrey Essman:	So curious that PMI can't build a new PMBOK update that is all encompassing without you having to buy two books
