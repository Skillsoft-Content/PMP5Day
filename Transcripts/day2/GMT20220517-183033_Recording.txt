05:42:10	Michael Roth:	Class materials: https://github.com/Skillsoft-Content/PMP5Day
05:42:35	Ryan Hastings:	PMI has a full list of definitions in the PMI Lexicon.
05:50:51	Michael Grant:	awesome!  thank you for the example
05:51:24	Aimee McLaughlin:	what's the second one called?
05:51:37	Aimee McLaughlin:	task board?
05:51:40	Cindy Cuencas:	The examples are pretty clear. Thanks 
05:51:44	Aimee McLaughlin:	thanks!
05:52:08	Maima Kamara:	my Q&A button  is greyed out, please advice
05:54:21	Lisa James:	Deep diving! 
05:54:33	Simone Bonner:	thanks
05:54:46	Ruben Hernandez:	Yes and thank you
05:54:47	Ian Fryman:	Thanks for helping us manage our expectations WRT preparing for the PMP exam!
05:54:54	Stephen Edmunds:	It has been helpful. I have done this but not at thi levle of detail
05:57:15	Morgan Libby:	Sometimes leadership can get out of control with colors!
05:57:54	Eddie Utuk:	@Carl Mullins - this is to let you know my password is no longer working for logging into Precipio.  I am currently logged in using the zoom info you sent yesterday.  I hope this does not affect my attendance history.  Thank you.
05:58:18	Timothy Waterman:	What's the difference between a Gantt and Project Schedule Network Diagram with Dates and Dependencies?
05:58:34	Henry Guevara:	How do you mark a stoppage and why we are at a standstill?
05:59:05	Stephanie Roman:	critical path method wasn't listed in the schedule formats. Is this separate from the schedule method?
05:59:17	Jonathan Olson:	All: That chart was from PMBOK 6th, , 6.5 Develop Schedule.
05:59:20	Cindy Cuencas:	I've seen legends added to project schedule charts - do you see that as useful?
06:02:18	Zendre L Glymph:	Performing a Critical Path Analysis is Module 15 in the coursework
06:03:24	Zendre L Glymph:	Submodule 3 within the Module
06:03:53	Zendre L Glymph:	Sumodule 6 is the Forward Pass
06:04:28	Stephen Edmunds:	I see. The late Early Finish is the Next Early Start
06:05:21	Robert Sproat:	Would your Estimate Accuracy high and low determine the Early Start Late Start?
06:05:30	Michael Roth:	This is Finish to Start dependencies, right?
06:05:42	EMDE JR:	why aren't activities d and r on the critical path? I always thought that the longest leading items would have to be on the critical path. these items seem to be on the side
06:06:48	Stefanos Koutsiumpis:	i did not get the "one vs zero" method
06:07:29	Ryan Marcotte:	Can you go through one method again?
06:07:38	Michelle Fortier:	Confused about how the late start and late finish times were determined
06:07:43	Lisa James:	One method starts on day 1 and hands off the following day where the zero method counts at zero and is handed off the sane day. 
06:07:44	Phillip Christensen:	@ stefanos - one method is technically correct since day 11 is included as a day of work. Zero method just works easier for the math
06:07:48	Jennifer Smith:	One Method doesn't make sense espeical since it didn't change the end date
06:07:48	Richard Baumert:	Is the critical path defined by the stakeholder(s) or PM?
06:08:02	Dylan Schuette:	EMDE JR the D & R activities were on the critical path based off the legend at the bottom. They just didn't have them in the middle.
06:10:21	Jamie Davis:	Take the "L"....well played, Susan
06:10:29	Stephen Edmunds:	L = Lesson
06:11:10	Abhishek Srivastava:	How to ensure that there is not 'too much' slack?
06:11:19	Suzanne Hemann:	Yes! - everyone must understand the critical path - that's one of the most asked questions - in my experience. Do not fear the math .
06:11:46	Simone Bonner:	I got kicked out 
06:11:54	Robert Ross:	How do we determine which activities constitute a "critical path activity?"
06:12:11	TASHARA Simpson:	Can you repeat that?
06:12:35	Jorge Arturo Monge:	those are the ones that determine how long your project is actually going to take, based on de dependencies you established
06:12:58	Siobhan Meehan:	Critical Path will always have the greatest sum of duration
Always has zero float/slack/buffer

06:13:29	Morgan Libby:	Robert I think its based off the tasks within the work package
06:13:31	Cindy Cuencas:	float, buffer, and ______? are interchangeable wrt  critical paths?
06:13:45	Ryan Marcotte:	slack
06:13:48	Kelly Brown:	slack
06:13:57	Cindy Cuencas:	I see, slack. Thanks 
06:14:03	Shaiema Joseph:	**Susan** could you zoom in so we can see where you are pointing with your mouse please?
06:14:32	TASHARA Simpson:	Thank you Megan
06:14:35	Yohannis Swaby:	would you use workers from the project completed to make the critical path shorter? 
06:14:53	TASHARA Simpson:	Sorry Siobhan
06:15:23	Michelle Fortier:	Can you share how late start and late finish were determined?
06:15:30	William Delmar:	***Susan*** can you review the definitions for ES, EF, LS, LF and how to calculate them?
06:15:35	Siobhan Meehan:	@Susan- can you please define the difference between One and zero method
06:17:08	Dave Embrey:	So it seems you would need to focus on those tasks with dependencies to focus efforts on critical path
06:18:34	Cole Garriott:	Could you go over the difference between float and total float? They sound the same to me
06:18:45	Sequoia Sime-Geffner:	I'm having a hard time reading the slides. 
06:18:57	Stephen Edmunds:	Float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed from its early start date
without delaying the project finish date or consecutive activities.

Total float is the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed or
extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or
violating a schedule constraint. 
06:19:09	Anitha Kurunthachalam:	Both forward and backward is applicable for both traditional and agile? or traditional only?
06:19:15	Lauren Wanzer:	download the slides from resources.
06:20:24	Ryan Marcotte:	Makes sense...thanks!
06:20:30	Roy Ho:	Is there a reason to choose one method over zero?
06:20:33	Alex Broud:	float is predetermined extra time
06:21:32	James Anderson:	Can You/Should you/How do you address expected "slow downs" of productivity such as during holiday weeks (Thanksgiving,  Christmas, etc.)? or unexpected shutdowns or process changes due to COVID like events?
06:21:51	Michelle Fortier:	**Susan** - please explain late start and late finish calculation
06:21:52	Roy Ho:	Thank you.
06:23:15	Gibb Little:	Could Agile use Gantt traditional method as well?
06:23:26	Gibb Little:	With just smaller increments?
06:26:00	Carmelo Rosario:	**Susan** Concerning @James question, I'm assuming that information can be pre determined in the schedule, much like accounting for employees PTO, schedule outages, etc. for the overall project?
06:26:50	Usman Sethi:	Is concept of critical path applicable to Agile methodology, if at all?
06:27:37	John Norseen:	Is it a common practice to add a time buffer to the critical path as other paths have inherent buffer?
06:28:04	Graham Crawford:	Many tools have calendars, and schedule type to take this into account
06:28:25	Gibb Little:	Agile sounds like it's a smaller team all working to develop a product, versus a large construction project with hundreds of Work Packages that all have to be scheduled/coordinated 
06:28:39	Anthony Melby:	The slide says do not factor in resource limitation. How come we wouldn't factor in limitations on things we need to stick to the schedule?
06:28:49	EMDE JR:	that's padding!
06:31:01	Seth Maldonado:	What about known resource limitations, should those be included?
06:35:48	TASHARA Simpson:	What is this chart called?
06:36:59	Aaron Butler:	Why wouldn't you do that in the first place? Use less people on A, and more on C in order to even out the finish times?
06:37:18	Rocky King:	is there any consideration due to the new norms i.e Hybrid
06:38:04	Issa Sall:	you're right Aaron
06:38:17	John Barnett:	Aaron...maybe space considerations or other unkown prevents more people from adding more efficiency
06:39:12	John Barnett:	if C losses were planned than you could build that leveling in the original plan and time estiments for the A
06:39:21	Aaron Butler:	@John, true unknowns. Also there may be processes that can't be sped up with more people
06:41:17	Aaron Butler:	J first
06:44:38	India Anderson:	Has anyone created a linked for this group?
06:44:48	India Anderson:	*linked in
06:44:51	Andrew Dugger:	Anyone in the Fort Hood area?
06:44:52	Jyothi Reddi:	anyone northen VA for study group
