01:12:32	Ryan Pursley:	Frank you're good
01:13:15	Michael Roth:	Is there a document somewhere that shows these steps "in order?" a sort of process flowchart?
01:14:27	Raymond Lawson:	PMBoK
01:14:44	Michael Roth:	thanks, Raymond
01:15:00	Skyler Hawkes:	did we glance over the enablers for this task?
01:15:42	Ian Fryman:	I could use about 15 seconds more each time we are asked to read the slides first
01:16:06	Jamie Davis:	we did
01:16:20	Skyler Hawkes:	thanks Susan!
01:17:08	Stephen Edmunds:	They dont have one on the provided slide deck either from the resources we can download
01:18:35	Jeffrey Nix:	my questions are not being responded to in the Q&A, can my chat be seen here
01:18:54	Raymond Lawson:	Susan, from yesterday, the first 10 or 20 slides PART 2 A are not in the downloadable decks on Presipio or Github
01:18:55	Sean Whiteman:	@Jeff yes
01:19:05	Michael Grant:	@Jeffrey Nex, yes
01:19:07	Jennifer Smith:	Try again?
01:19:21	Jeffrey Nix:	thank you
01:19:59	John Barnett:	raymond thru percipio if you go to 8 day cohort resource tab and download, those slides matched hers exactly
01:20:13	Graham Crawford:	Can you review difference between Project mgmt plan and implementation plan again please?
01:20:30	Graham Crawford:	mgmt is what, implementation is how?
01:21:35	William Delmar:	Will PMP include PIP, Risk Mgmt Plan, Sked Mgmt Plan, Quality Plan, etc.?
01:21:44	William Rogers:	@Jeffrey Nix I don't see your questions in Q&A
01:22:32	Raymond Lawson:	Thanks John, How in the world did you figure that out? Just looking around?
01:23:56	Jeffrey Nix:	I was asking about tracking attendance
01:24:56	Raymond Lawson:	I learned mind mapping for the first time at CGSC. Very useful planning tool. and study tool as well.
01:25:30	Derrek Saxton:	I think it's Zoom trying to preserve bandwidth.
01:25:31	John Barnett:	downloaded wrong slides my mistake and they matched up Raymond
01:25:34	Michael Grant:	I have downloaded the .pdf and use that when I can't read the slide being broadcast/streamed.
01:25:35	Claudio Bomfim:	Suggestion: download and open the presentation in your computer as well.
01:25:38	Felicia Assan:	when you say "classic" do you mean traditional
01:25:41	Ryan McIlquham:	Or download the slide deck and follow along, taking notes.
01:25:59	Phillip Christensen:	If you're using Percipio you can get the slides from Resources and follow along on your own.
01:26:03	Lauren Wanzer:	you can download the slides from your resources tab on Percipio.
01:26:54	Raymond Lawson:	You can download the slides and follow that way on side by side screen. You can make notes on the slides and save all for later for study. its better then a notebook and puts the notes on the slide where you heard the information.
01:27:13	John Branch:	***Susan*** Why are Change Management Plan and Configuration Management Plan in the "Additional Components" versus Subsidiary Plans. Weren't those in the required components of a Project Management Plan previously? 
01:28:22	Frank Carranco:	thank you!
01:28:39	Joseph Stapleton:	Ben Franklin 
01:28:55	Cierra White:	Benjamin Franklin, if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.
01:29:08	Alex Broud:	what is a typical timeframe to ask for when starting the plan/proposal?
01:29:34	Christopher Hall:	I is also helpful to know that you are rarely starting from scratch. Modify pre-existing documents to meet your needs.
01:29:50	DEAN ZEZEUS:	Three items in the additional components are called "plans", none of the items in the "subsidiary plans" are labeled "plans."
01:29:59	Charmakeitha Smith:	Can’t get QA screen up for technical support.  No audio and trouble logging in this morning on laptop.  Trying to use phone but won’t expand and no audio!  @Carl….can you send zoom link or call 915-227-4522 to assist please!
01:30:03	Christopher Hall:	*It
01:30:30	DEAN ZEZEUS:	What then is the distinction between additional components and subsidiary plans?
01:30:39	Clifford Weinstein:	The slide shows Baselines of Scope, Schedule and Cost also as Subsidiary Plans, is it both?

01:31:29	Ryan Pursley:	What was the difference between the two types if Scope in the image?
01:32:09	John Branch:	Are the Subsidiary Plans no longer called "XXX Management Plan"?
01:32:23	John Branch:	For example, Cost Management Plan?

01:33:36	Seth Maldonado:	Is the “Iron Triangle” a testable term?
01:34:07	Anitha Kurunthachalam:	Project might have all different plans from different parties like, Dev/Test/Performance test/Infrastructure etc., for integration management is there any standard template you recommend for gap analysis? 
01:34:16	Anitha Kurunthachalam:	All the plans are applicable for both Traditional and Agile? 
01:37:09	Raymond Lawson:	That's how the Army works? lol
01:37:41	Alex Broud:	photocopy yourself instead of becoming a pidgeon holed into  an SME
01:37:43	Christopher Hall:	In the Navy we call this training your relief

01:47:03	Siobhan Meehan:	Perfect!
01:47:27	Lisa James:	How it's built vs what is needed to build it
01:48:01	Adam Cannon:	Does feedback from the sponsor/stakeholder that changes the configuration end up being reflected in an updated WBS dictionary?
01:48:27	Paul Dailey:	***Susan*** Is the change management plan developed per project or is that determined by the organization and the project has to adhere to that?
01:48:29	Lisa James:	True
01:48:39	Ian Fryman:	mine
01:48:43	Mark Vertuli:	pm

01:49:36	Cassie Strojny:	Iso certified companies typically have change management plans. Correct?
01:49:36	vanessa  ramos:	who typically sits on the CCB?
01:49:59	Christopher Hall:	Who typically comprises a Change Control Board?
01:50:59	Joseph Stapleton:	Key stakeholders and sponsors I believe. 
01:51:33	Stephanie Roman:	So you should have both change plans built into the project management plan in the very beginning? 
01:51:38	Vanessa Goldsmith:	Is the slide suppose to change?
01:51:40	Christopher Hall:	Rgr, thank you.
01:52:17	Andrew Dugger:	**Susan Daniels**
01:52:35	Andrew Dugger:	What is the best practice when staff sections are resistant to change?
01:54:01	Michael Franco:	Is the configuration management plan a close hold document or shared with the team 
01:54:45	Paul Dailey:	***Susan*** Is the change management plan developed per project or is that determined by the organization and the project has to adhere to that?
01:54:49	Lisa James:	Can you repeat what it saves me?
01:55:04	Jason Vulcan:	@Susan, would you repeat the columns you would add to your Resource Traceability Matrix to come up with the Config. Management System?
01:55:31	John Barnett:	Jason she said configuration specs
01:57:31	Charmakeitha Smith:	The 5 Ws
01:57:33	John Barnett:	what/when/authority
01:57:50	Cindy Cuencas:	Add three columns that show on who is accountable, who has authority to change, and the justification 
01:57:56	Charmakeitha Smith:	Who what when and why
01:58:36	John Barnett:	change = new reuirement/resources
01:58:54	John Barnett:	config. = change in specs...requirement/reso stays the same
02:00:12	Jamie Davis:	thx John
02:00:32	Mark Murphy:	How do you verify potential ripple effects on other activities that arise from a change?
02:03:49	John Branch:	*** Susan ** *can you repeat the Notes for SAFe
02:04:14	Aaron Butler:	I saw a bunch of study groups pop up. I re-branded a group to be a collaboration group vice only study. Hopefully it will live on past studying and us all hopefully becoming certified.
