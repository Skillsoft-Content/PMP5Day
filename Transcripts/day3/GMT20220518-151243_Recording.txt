02:28:31	Siobhan Meehan:	Who decides this? and obviously happens before Budget is agreed?
02:28:38	Emile Cochet:	I'm trying to wrap my head around why you would offer training prior to handing off a product to the customer.
02:28:58	Adam Cannon:	Does this frequently involve characterizing a potential cost as an "investment" if there is enduring value?
02:33:25	**Susan Daniels**:	You should be able to put the steps in order
02:34:01	James Fung:	ive lost sound, has anyone else?
02:34:19	Ryan Pursley:	I was booted
02:34:21	Jeremiah Clark:	sound is good
02:34:54	Alfonso Castaneda:	no sound
02:35:02	Andrew Potts:	Easy math, but what do the variables 100x and 25x represent again?
02:35:04	Zendre L Glymph:	Make or Buy Analysis is under Implementing a Procurement Strategy Module 20. Submodule 6
02:35:09	Cindy Cuencas:	I have sound
02:35:20	Paul Cruwys:	Great video Barbara
02:35:21	vanessa  ramos:	call for audio or use the Q&A
02:35:34	Alexander Lenz:	would you include the cost of capability investment?
02:35:43	Lucas Frank:	Emile, because the product may be delayed and the customer may have already committed to buyâ€¦.this is happening with the aircraft the USMC has agreed to sell the Israel Air Force 
02:36:05	Hailey Kimble:	name of video module? I want to rewatch 
02:37:02	Kara Vernon:	I think it was called Make or Buy (or something similar)
02:37:24	Ian Bennett - O2O Corhort iPad:	The video is cited in the slides
02:37:29	Joseph Stapleton:	Course: Deep Dive into Project Procurement (2021 Update) Video: Make-or-buy Analysis
02:37:42	James Anderson:	Reminder for sound problems:  To get sound by "Phone", go to lower left and select Audio Setting, Select "Phone Call" tab, and follow prompts.
02:37:44	Ian Bennett - O2O Corhort iPad:	Make-or-buy analysis under deep dive into project procurement
02:38:04	Kara Vernon:	@Emile We also incorporate administrative training before handing off product to customer so that they can manage the product effectively after handoff (and don't screw things up hehe)
02:38:21	Felicia Assan:	"Susan" excellent explanation
02:43:24	John Barnett:	doesn
02:43:51	John Barnett:	doesn't it make sense that we have quotes/bids before we make final make or buy decision?
02:44:42	Michael Franco:	**susan** does the PM or the procurement team take the lead in the procurement management plan? 
02:45:25	David Franco:	John, it could be for budgetary purposes or like Susan said, to make the MAKE/BUY decision
02:46:17	Felicia Assan:	yes, very helpful
02:47:04	Felicia Assan:	ethics
02:47:20	Felicia Assan:	sole sourcing not good 
02:47:21	Elizabeth Wills:	Dunn & Bradstreet isn't used for the federal Govt. anymore. It's now Unique Entity Identifiers (UEI) through SAM.

02:48:01	Stephen Edmunds:	Nice way to handle a possible favoritism 
02:48:07	Sheree Wolliston:	That never happens.... gulp. Perfect response!
02:48:21	Lisa James:	Right Sheree lol 
02:50:22	John Branch:	*** Is that the same as Industry Day in government contracting? 
02:50:23	John Mateer:	industry day = bidder conference in usaf procurement i think.
02:50:41	Rocky King:	RFP??
02:50:50	John Mateer:	john branch, i think you are correct
02:51:22	Jason Shurtz:	I did this for contractors painting my house.
02:52:00	Elisabeth Devin:	Who would govern a bidder stating unfairness?
02:54:01	Robert Henderson:	Air Force tanker procurement in the 1990s failed because of this (and other reasons)
02:54:38	Anitha Kurunthachalam:	thanks very well explained about bidder conferences. 
02:54:39	Rocky King:	is this like an RFP?
02:55:00	Jose Ramirez:	Is there a rule of thumb for # of bidding companies to be present in a bidders conference? Are all qualified vendors invited?
02:55:07	Seth Maldonado:	@Rocky RFP = Request for Proposal
02:55:41	Rocky King:	Thanks
02:55:46	Lee Cooper:	Its like an industry day.
02:55:56	Dawn Dunlop:	Important to invite all qualified vendors
02:56:29	Andrew Potts:	Is time and material the same as cost plus?
02:56:44	Andrew Potts:	s time and material the same as cost plus?
02:59:03	Aaron Amick:	It is very important to have the vendor report to keep tabs on their schedule. 
03:02:03	Michael Fresenburg:	Difference beTween FP and FFP?
03:02:42	TASHARA Simpson:	fixed price contract- home renovation
03:02:46	Kelly Brown:	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
03:02:46	Ryan Pursley:	cost-reimbursement = prototyping?
03:02:53	Kimberly Zunker:	Could cost-reimburseable and T&M look the same in a service industry, i.e. consulting?
03:02:59	Andrew Phillips:	Andrew -- Cost plus is a type of cost-reimbursable 
03:03:01	TASHARA Simpson:	Cost reimbursable- lawyer
03:03:16	Kelly Brown:	633
03:03:30	Sequoia Sime-Geffner:	Fixed pricing= buying a house already built, Cost-reimbursable= building custom house, T & M= repairing home after natural disaster 
03:03:50	Thomas Hanifen:	is there time to bid if there is an emergency?
03:04:14	Roy Ho:	What exactly is a 'Contract Vehicle'?
03:04:41	Ryan Pursley:	thank you sequoia!
03:05:00	Jeffrey Kelley:	Great examples sequoia, thanks!
03:05:24	Eddie Utuk:	Susan, for the agile contract types which is the most favorable from a buyer's standpoing?
03:05:31	Roy Ho:	thank you
03:05:56	Eddie Utuk:	*Standpoint
03:06:43	Adam Cannon:	In these discussions, customer=buyer?
03:07:38	**Carl Mullin**:	In these discussions the buyer is the organization performing the project work unless otherwise told.
03:07:42	Mohan Mylvaganam:	Are you still the buyer in Agile Contract?
03:09:30	Michael O'Leary:	Are the agile types listed in most to least favorable?
03:09:55	Eddie Utuk:	Thank you Susan -  great explanation!
03:10:11	Christopher Hall:	So these are incremental fixe-price contracts?
03:10:29	Stephen Moss:	time and material contracts work out cheaper in my industry, is that in general would you say?
03:10:29	Christopher Hall:	*fixed
03:11:04	Lee Cooper:	NTE = Travel costs; misc expenses
03:11:18	Seth Maldonado:	Would a design/build contract be an example of Cost-reimbursable?
03:12:08	Abhishek Srivastava:	Is the PM decision maker on the contract type OR someone else?
03:13:36	Jim Shaw:	So our/PM/buyer as POC to engage wtih vendors occurs AFTER bid is accepted and vendor is selected? Prior to that, our only engagement with vendors is during bidder conference only to respond to SOW questions. However, after bid selection, we become the POC/point of entry for any/all vendor issues. Is this correct?
03:15:03	Elizabeth Zhang:	is procurement mostly responsible for managing contract changes?
03:16:08	Heema Sharma:	are administrative changes communicated via a formal document or more informal (e.g. an email)?
03:16:11	Sequoia Sime-Geffner:	***Susan***where do amendments fit in here?
03:16:57	Michael Roth:	Example of Constructive Changes?
03:17:20	Michelle Fortier:	Is that like a scope of work contract?
03:18:24	Michael McDonald:	**SUSAN** Ex. Master Supplier Agreement, and a project specific PO as the supplemental?
03:18:49	Michael McDonald:	*Master Service Agreement... 
03:19:59	Michael McDonald:	how do Constructive and Contract Modifcation differ?
03:20:08	Michael O'Leary:	are these predominatley for waterfall?
03:21:38	John Barnett:	i would think ccontract mod. is when you id. a new or different requirement.....constructive is more to recover from a delay in construction to recover the schedule...maybe change in deadline, or additional people to recover time
03:22:50	Adam Keil:	Is there usually a separate QA process involved for contracts?
03:23:07	Charmakeitha Smith:	**Susan** can you explain supplemental changes with an example again please
03:23:32	Stephen Edmunds:	Legal 
03:24:42	Kelly McCann:	can you repeat that sentence it was very well worded
03:24:48	Tom Fuller:	Wow, so you're saying if we ever grant someone leniency  we run the risk of them legally not having to meet contract requirements
03:26:05	**Carl Mullin**:	@Kelly if you missed what Susan said, you can request the recording to listen back to 24 to 48 hours after the session ends at mentoring@skillsoft.com
03:26:13	Aaron Butler:	I saw a bunch of study groups pop up. I re-branded a group to be a collaboration group vice only study. Hopefully it will live on past studying and us all hopefully becoming certified.
