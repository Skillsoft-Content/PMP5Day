05:34:45	Jodie Christopher:	You are most welcome Arianne!
05:35:14	**Carl Mullin**:	The vocabulary can be found from the Resources tab to the right of the Attend tab in the Project Management Professional (PMP) ATP Bootcamp: 5 Day Cohort channel
05:35:23	Robert Henderson:	Susan -- why wasn't the first answer CPIF?  There were costs for supplies plus a $5K fee -- wasn't cost only
05:35:58	Brenda Calvert:	:)
05:36:02	David Delgado:	Yay
05:36:56	LaSharon Hampton:	Hi Susan are you projecting.  I cannot see anything
05:38:33	Cindy Cuencas:	the slides are visible, LaSharon
05:38:41	**Carl Mullin**:	Susan is visible. The slide is for Risk.
05:39:07	Ryan Pursley:	Never let a good disaster go to waste.
05:39:09	Joseph Dewey:	catastrophic success
05:41:06	Alex Broud:	fear of budget controls
05:41:47	**Carl Mullin**:	@Robert - In a CPIF the seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work and receives a predetermined incentive fee based on achieving certain performance objectives as set forth in the contract. There was no mention of an incentive fee in the Mastery Question. For more details about the contract types I recommend reviewing Plan Procurement Management in the PMBOK Guide 6th Edition.
05:42:59	Robert Henderson:	Thanks, Carl.  But didn't the question specifically state $5K fee at the end of the verbiage?  Did I misread that?
05:43:35	**Carl Mullin**:	@Robert - It was an invoice fee, not an incentive fee.
05:43:38	Thomas Hanifen:	Lessons learned
05:43:46	Michael McDonald:	Great job Susan!  lol
05:44:26	Robert Henderson:	Ahhh...I did misread that.  Thanks for the clarification.  I understand the differences, just read too fast.
05:44:52	**Carl Mullin**:	You're welcome
05:52:17	John Barnett:	like jahari's window
05:54:19	Edgardo E Del valle:	used car salesman 
05:54:20	Glen Moody:	very similar to the jahri window
05:54:34	Carl Hawkins:	yes pretty much Johari window
05:56:39	Brenda Calvert:	thanks for sharing that - Johari window.  
05:58:15	Maria Beltre:	do we need to think about a mitigation plan for risks or a contingency plan as part of our risk registry ?
05:59:03	Eddie Utuk:	Susan please can you expound on accept, exploit, transfer, and mitigate as it pertains to risk decisions?
05:59:04	John Mateer:	situationally aware
05:59:48	Ryan McIlquham:	How do you remove biases when collecting information to determine risks?
06:02:20	Rayvin Pack:	f
06:03:23	**Susan Daniels**:	@ Ryan at the risk collection step we are not concerned about bias.  It is during the qualitative analysis that bias my come to the surface.  We use a probability and impact matrix to help manage bias.
06:03:45	Ryan McIlquham:	Thank you
06:04:17	Michael Roth:	Who is typically the decision authority on accepting Threat Risks?
06:05:22	**Susan Daniels**:	Michael, this will be addressed after the video
06:08:15	John Branch:	Like winning the lottery
06:08:22	Mark Murphy:	This is how the Air Force assesses residual safety risk associated with weapons programs being procured.
06:09:07	Jennifer Aguilar:	RiskAssessmentCode Matrix from the Navy
06:09:36	Roque Garciaaponte:	Do you multiply to get the score?
06:09:50	Mark Murphy:	MILSTD 882E has a matrix that establishes standards across the DoD.
06:09:54	Eduardo Defendini:	as a percentage of total budget baseline, about how much, on a average, does the PM budget to address risks?
06:10:12	Anthony Feige:	So Impact is weighted more than Probability
06:12:00	Paul Dailey:	Why aren't probability and impact ranked equally?
06:12:23	Norman Johnson:	the impact and probability are typically subjective assessments based on expert judgement.  
06:13:11	Timm Kroll:	Same in 6sigma, but there are tools to help. :)
06:14:46	Brian Spring:	**Susan** Can you provide an example of a very high impact and very high probability opportunity?
06:15:01	Eduardo Defendini:	ty
06:15:32	**Carl Mullin**:	Risk - Impact x Probability
06:15:33	Paul Dailey:	What I mean is, why isn't the scale the same?
06:15:42	Mark Murphy:	Does the PM or sponsor establish standards for which risk levels require action and how?
06:15:51	Michael McDonald:	Brian, a secondary PO placed for Installation and Commissioning of the new equipment built
06:15:52	Roy Ho:	he means why .9 vs .8.
06:15:56	Eduardo Defendini:	firt to market
06:16:12	John Barnett:	@ Brian....resource materials unavail (hi prob due to covid) that would prevent you from building the thing (high impact)
06:16:30	Ian Randall:	A low/nos cost process change at saves many man-hours
06:16:37	Elizabeth Toenyes:	high probability high impact like shipping delays in new construction. it delays the build but is almost inevitable in this market
06:16:40	John Barnett:	especially for single source materials
06:16:46	Michael McDonald:	I work for an OEM, we kick off the project with the equipment manufacutring, and later quote the Installation and Commissioning support in the field, as well as spare parts that are required.  these are basically guaranteed, and a good chunk of money
06:17:11	Ryan Pursley:	So is the military
06:17:16	Dawn Dunlop:	Paul - Ultimately it is the impact that matters to the project, this is why impact has higher 'weighting' in decision risk calculation.  High probability low impact doesn't bother me, but low probability high impact might.  Hope that helps.
06:18:02	Phillip Christensen:	high prob/ high impact ... a known software vulnerability with a known fix that is not applied and then exploited. not applying patch = high probability; exploitation = high impact
06:18:25	Paul Dailey:	@Dawn - Thank you for the explanation. That does help.
06:21:04	Joseph Stapleton:	High Likelihood High Risk might be the project relying on the outside manufacturing of a complex machine using new technology from a company that is frequently late on delivery. A delay could have significant cost impacts for the project. We're dealing with this now. 
06:21:15	Michael Roth:	Are there PMP softwares that will conducta Monte Carlo analysis for a project risks?
06:22:17	**Susan Daniels**:	@ Michael,  Yes, these days one can obtain this type of software for a reasonable fee.
06:23:18	Simone Bonner:	is this something recommended ?
06:23:59	Robert Henderson:	Excel can do this
06:24:02	Kimberly Zunker:	Monte carlo simulations can be run in the Excel Data Analysis add-on, but you need expertise to do it yourself
06:27:23	David Chui:	this sounds like the military PACE method. Primary Plan. Alternate Plan. Contingency Plan. Emergency Plan. 
06:27:55	Edgardo E Del valle:	Control Measures, for anything that can go wrong -will go wrong  
06:27:58	Jodie Christopher:	this also aligns with ITIL 4
06:27:58	Carmelo Rosario:	@David I agree
06:28:11	Jim Shaw:	It is but note that terminology is slightly different with contingency plan occupying different points.
06:28:46	Jason Shurtz:	does work around = progressive elaboration?
06:29:12	Ian Bennett - O2O Corhort iPad:	So second and third order effects
06:29:33	Cindy Cuencas:	Exactly, Jason 
06:29:46	Seth Maldonado:	Avengers?
06:29:50	Chad Ross:	Smash
06:29:52	Ryan Marcotte:	**Susan** What's the difference between a contingency and fallback plan?
06:29:52	Carmelo Rosario:	smash
06:29:53	Jodie Christopher:	SMASH
06:29:54	Viola:	Smash
06:29:54	Jeffrey Kelley:	smash
06:29:54	Kevin McLin:	smash
06:29:55	Michael McDonald:	HULK SMASH!!!
06:29:56	John Barnett:	Smash!!!!
06:29:57	Seth Maldonado:	!!!
06:29:57	Viola:	I love the HULK
06:29:58	Ramon Diaz Soto:	SMASH!!!
06:29:58	Simone Bonner:	smashes
06:30:03	Paul Dailey:	Nice!
06:30:03	Bonniekeya Kliest:	love the example
06:30:10	Skyler Hawkes:	HULK ANGRY! HULK SMASH
06:30:12	Stephen Moss:	great example! haha
06:30:21	John Branch:	great example! 
06:30:40	Vanessa Scales:	great example!
06:30:43	Jim Shaw:	Collateral damage is a good example of military secondary risk that most people will know.
06:30:58	Jodie Christopher:	Yes Jim, exactly
06:30:59	Simone Bonner:	snow
06:30:59	Natalie Byrd:	snow
06:31:03	John Barnett:	weather
06:31:06	Tom Fuller:	Avalanche
06:31:07	Blaine O'Reilly:	delays
06:31:07	John Norseen:	Black ice, avalanche, storm
06:31:07	Simone Bonner:	road blocks
06:31:07	Karen Denny:	inaccessible roads
06:31:11	Kelly Brown:	impassable road
06:31:12	Michael McDonald:	sasquach
06:31:13	Carmelo Rosario:	gas prices
06:31:14	Charmakeitha Smith:	avalanche
06:32:02	John Norseen:	Helicopter
06:32:19	Natalie Byrd:	plane
06:32:20	Joseph Stapleton:	Using a forecast to plan in Colorado is having no plan at all. ;) 
06:32:24	Erin Becote:	Snowmobile
06:32:26	Charmakeitha Smith:	Good example Jim
06:32:27	Heema Sharma:	Hulk to carry and smash through snow
06:32:30	Norman Johnson:	dog sled
06:33:17	Cindy Cuencas:	Now that it is at airport, now we need a work around? 
06:33:19	Alex Broud:	can waivers be used as a fall back plan?
06:35:06	Simone Bonner:	I'm confused once at the airport then what?
