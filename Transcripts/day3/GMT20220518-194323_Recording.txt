07:44:00	Stephen Moss:	is that not bad for team culture?
07:44:47	Ryan Hastings:	This lecture is interactive right now.  Then, a targeted email is "pushed" to participants to notify the recorded lecture is posted online.  Finally, anyone with the link (even outside the initial push) can pull the recorded lecture and view it.  
07:45:21	Graham Crawford:	SOB's - Specific Observable Behaviors
07:45:31	Melissa Paloschi:	know your team - some people don't appreciate public praise
07:45:41	Graham Crawford:	Deposits or withdrawals from emotional bank account
07:45:46	Levi Burgess:	what about sending to the individual and cc the supervisor? More personable that way I believe
07:46:46	India Anderson:	We also want to have emotional intelligence when praising someone. If a team member is an introvert they may prefer to be praised in private rather then among the team
