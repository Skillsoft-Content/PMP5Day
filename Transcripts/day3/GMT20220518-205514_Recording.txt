08:02:29	**Carl Mullin**:	Each session has a total of 480 mins (including the instruction and breaks) and you are allowed to miss 15 mins in a session before the exception kicks in regardless if it is during the break or not.
08:02:53	Jarrett Johnson:	G2G Susan! You are awesome! We see and hear it
08:02:55	**Carl Mullin**:	Attendance requirements 5-Day Bootcamp – Attend at least 4 of the 5 live sessions and make up the missed session by watching on Replay. A session is considered to be a missed session if you miss more than 15 mins in a session. If you miss more than 1 session, you would have to make up any additional sessions beyond the one by attending live in the next run for the 5-Day Bootcamp. You can't mix sessions between the 5-Day and 8-Day Bootcamp to get the 35 hours.

08:08:31	Tom Fuller:	What goes in the sweetspot in the middle
08:08:53	Norman Johnson:	do you keep the Stakeholder power assessment in a non-sharable document.  It seems like that is info you might not want to be public.
08:11:13	Michael McDonald:	SALES!!!!
08:11:20	Christopher Hall:	This seems like it could get messy if it fell into the wrong hands
08:12:11	Sean Whiteman:	When I have  used this type of document it was hand written and NEVER on a computer or shared.
08:12:19	Jon Kincaid:	Bad Romance... this is where the art of this trade meets the rest of the science we have been discussing.
08:12:38	Ian Fryman:	Shouldn't it be a Sponsor Engagement Assessment Matrix?
08:14:00	Jim Shaw:	This kind of document is fine - it's the level and types of details that you input that could create issues. It's critical to keep this focused on material needs of the project and stay away from personal information. For example: Bob likes golf so I'll pitch him on the golf course. This is bad. What is good would be: Bob previously supported a similar project and could facilitate engagement with other stakeholders. 
08:14:35	Ryan Marcotte:	**Susan** Should you have multiple leading stakeholders?
08:16:14	Cindy Cuencas:	Agree w/Sean W
08:18:06	Peter Thompson:	This would be helpful if someone were to step into your shoes and take over
08:18:11	Cindy Cuencas:	How would this be phrased as a test question/scenario? 
08:18:13	David Chui:	It seems that it's better for a stakeholder to be in the "unaware" section instead of the resistant section if the person is going to be resistant.
08:18:31	Alexander Lenz:	is there some instance where you would want to do this for sponsers?
08:18:38	Joseph Stapleton:	Can you desire a stakeholder to have less engagement? Example? 
08:20:33	John Barnett:	depends on if you need resources from them 
08:20:48	Deanne LaFace:	could you frame a test question around this
08:20:50	Ryan Marcotte:	How often should this matrix be updated?
08:21:05	Alexander Lenz:	yes, have them more involved?
08:21:22	Eduardo Defendini:	probably better on comm plan
08:22:25	John Barnett:	i think you should be open and tell them what you need
08:22:38	John Barnett:	if they are youre sponsor they will come thru
08:25:44	Heema Sharma:	would SOPs be artifacts or project documents?
08:27:03	Michael McDonald:	neither, OPA
08:27:10	Elizabeth Zhang:	Are test results from the validation process considered project Artifacts?
08:27:11	Ryan Pursley:	Could a list of people you want to work with in the future be an aritifact?
08:27:18	Cindy Cuencas:	Are completed checklists artifacts? 
08:27:19	Sean Whiteman:	Wouldn't performance reports be part of the Project Docsuments?
08:27:34	Dave Embrey:	Historical documents 
08:27:48	Michael McDonald:	Is it safe to equate DELIVERABLE = externally distributed to customer?
08:28:24	Charmakeitha Smith:	SOPs are OPAs so I would bet that makes them fall under project plan
08:28:45	Tonya Guillot:	Could production progress reports be apart of the artifacts document?
08:29:00	Felicia Assan:	"susan" some emails may be artifacts- approvals?
08:29:08	Charmakeitha Smith:	that;s ok susan...lol
08:29:18	Chad Ross:	Would the engagement assessment be a an artifact? 
08:29:27	Aaron Amick:	Documents that show how the project progressed in real time, and are a good place to also put lessons learned and how you dealt with it as you go along. 
08:29:48	Jonathan Olson:	The Artifacts you describe initially sounds like they are daunting to organize, archive and reference.
08:30:13	Heema Sharma:	If you develop a new process for your client and that includes a standard operating procedure, how would that be defined? It seems like something produced along the way but also a deliverable. 
08:30:49	Patrick Walker:	slide 41 has "lessons learned" and "project charter" listed as artifacts, aren't these formal project documents?
08:31:47	Claudio Bomfim:	Project Charter is an artifact?
08:31:48	Michael Roth:	Patrick, the way I see it is yes to your question, but will also become artifacts for future projects
08:32:00	Norman Johnson:	Why is it important to differentiate between artifacts and formal documents?
08:32:05	Paul Schmidt:	Would the project charter be a document 
08:33:56	Charmakeitha Smith:	Artifacts=non standard that is being  produced along the way, i.e charters, scope
08:33:56	Jim Shaw:	@Norman: documents help you know key aspects of building and managing a project but artifacts could help you in doing the daily work like building PowerPoint slides, agendas, etc. Or, maybe even seeing someone's distro list to see if there are people/orgs that you might want to add. 
08:34:44	Jim Shaw:	Priority would be on documents. Dig into artifacts by need.
08:35:29	Charmakeitha Smith:	Project Documents= standard i.e., SOPs or OPAs 
08:35:57	Blake Weitzel:	Susan, you mentioned the courtesy email you would disseminate regarding work packages and updating them into the configuration management, are these terms that other NON-PMP cert'd project managers should be familiar with? 
08:36:06	Ryan Pursley:	This burned me in my final briefing. I uploaded an older iteration of the power point
08:36:09	Cindy Cuencas:	yes
08:36:16	Ramon Diaz Soto:	yes
08:36:17	Kelly Brown:	definitely
08:36:18	Joseph Dewey:	definately
08:36:21	TRACI SLUSS:	absolutely. 
08:36:21	Carmelo Rosario:	Yes, really anoying
08:36:21	Ryan Pursley:	and yes, I used power point. 
08:36:22	Felicia Assan:	yes!!!
08:36:26	Eddie Utuk:	Yes
08:36:27	John Norseen:	Microsoft Teams has helped mitigate this immensly
08:36:28	Kara Vernon:	yes 50k mistake by team
08:36:31	Ashley Worboys:	Everyday our company struggles with this -
08:36:31	Michael McDonald:	is initial release rev.00 or rev.01?
08:36:32	John Mateer:	military = worst in vers control. :-(
08:36:33	Carleythia Anderson:	No, we have a pretty good process involving naming convention.
08:36:34	Jim Shaw:	Multiple people editing same document for a briefing but all have different naming conventions while saving to the same folder... Argh!
08:36:35	Lisa James:	Used to, cloud storage saved my life! 
08:36:37	Lisa James:	and sanity
08:37:37	Blain Jones:	GitHub
08:37:38	Ryan Pursley:	sharepoint, I think does that for anything that is uploaded
08:37:45	Michael O'Leary:	Old SharePoint and SPO does it
08:38:02	Felicia Assan:	love sharepoont
08:38:37	Matthew Hummel:	That slide referred to the project management plan as an artifact.  Shouldn't that be a project document?

08:40:18	Charmakeitha Smith:	Each department should have an assigned administrator on sharepoint to keep info updated and purged
08:40:31	Charmakeitha Smith:	project mgmt office=PMO
08:42:04	Sean Whiteman:	Sixth Ed:  The project management plan is one of the primary project artifacts, but there are other documents that are not part of the project management plan that are used to manage the project. These other documents are called project documents. 
08:42:43	Sean Whiteman:	Sixth ed Part 2 section 1.11
08:42:48	Joseph Stapleton:	Yay!
08:43:15	Joseph Stapleton:	YES and I asked about it earlier. 
08:43:50	Arianne Wilson:	currently experiencing ALL of the above lol
08:44:41	Amanda Cray:	Vague scope, not identifying the true environment if it’s technology. That can cause a lot of addition time, cost etc. change request is needed
08:45:08	Jason Maass:	How does New Regulations fit into your risk assessment? How could you ever predict New regulations such as building codes or changes in law?
08:45:55	Amanda Cray:	You can’t predict but you can use for lesson learned for a future project to ask the questions ahead of time and put it as a risk
08:46:19	Amanda Cray:	For the current project hold the customer accountable to let you know
08:47:59	Amado Mena:	Spoken like a pro Susan!
08:48:19	Brenda Calvert:	Love it!
08:49:01	Mario Pais:	When/Where are the "filters" defined?
08:50:37	Joseph Stapleton:	Where does the Change Management Board fit into this? 
08:50:37	Michelle Fortier:	If during a verbal conversation they communicate the desired change, and you can determine at that point that the deliverable will not be affected, can you just verbally tell them that formal change request isn't needed?  Or does this all NEED to be documented?
08:50:53	Ryan Patterson:	Are all change request forms filtered through the CCB?
08:51:05	Charmakeitha Smith:	Sound is choppy and my Q&A button is grayed out to report
08:52:51	Michelle Fortier:	Sounds good - thanks!
08:53:15	Stephen Edmunds:	Not written didnt happen
08:53:19	Jodie Christopher:	When in doubt, write it out!
08:53:32	Michael Roth:	documentation helps avoid he said/she said too
08:54:11	Ramon Diaz Soto:	Absolutely - helps protect you
08:55:05	Eduardo Defendini:	preventive action wouldn't change deliverable... so the previous flow chart would never push it to implement
08:56:05	Tonya Guillot:	Issues= realized risk
08:56:17	Cindy Cuencas:	L/C
08:56:58	John Norseen:	I was kicked out for a minute. Can someone please type what she said about risk?
08:57:24	Charmakeitha Smith:	Skillcraft queen and king...lol.  Document document document!
08:57:33	Jodie Christopher:	If a risk happens, it becomes an issue. A risk is a 
probability. An issue is real and has to be dealt with.
08:57:33	Melissa Paloschi:	risk = probable/could happen
08:57:34	Paul Schmidt:	Risks when they happen become issues
08:57:42	John Norseen:	Thank you
08:58:49	Jamie Davis:	Risks are unavoidable in my field. We could not possibly document every risk so we limit to damage to people, equipment and operating space. 
08:59:32	Claudio Bomfim:	Another useful thing is to add a qualitative information of the issue, the severity of the issue.
08:59:42	Christopher Hall:	Limit the number
08:59:44	Michelle Fortier:	Limit the number of open issues...
08:59:56	Timm Kroll:	You can delegate them?
09:00:48	Adam Cannon:	Otherwise you might not give the sponsor enough time to address the issue.
09:00:51	Amanda Cray:	It could also be referring to closing the issues or risk and not leaving them open. I agree we don’t have control over how many we receive
09:01:26	Kayla Justice:	Where is the issue log kept? Is it public?
